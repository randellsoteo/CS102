"adrien_ngoc_1701","1 March 2019","My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.For someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan's remarkable works:
Memento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I've ever seen. But overall, it doesn't reach the same level of Inception.The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven't been able to find the very particular ""Nolan's spirit"" in it.The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan's nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience's mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception.
SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven't watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!It is set in the world where there's technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - ""extractors"" who use this technology to infiltrate the target's subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of stealing, he wants them to plant an idea in a person's subconscious, which is also called ""inception"". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels ""dream within a dream"", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito's biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who's dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father's business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer's mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb's past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb's case, it's the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We're now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn't even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn't care any more, what's important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life.
Some short lines about the cast:
Leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).There was something missing in Ken Watanabe's performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie.","

"srcooper-756-646671","22 December 2020","You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully.
It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter.
It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing.
It is beautiful and absorbing.
It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen.
I don't see it often, in case it's not as good as I like to remember it.
That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement.
That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all.
For some, perhaps it is in the cinema watching this.","

"EVON1TY","2 March 2023","When I first watch this movie, I was just shocked with it's twist. I'm not gonna mention details, because can't share any spoilers.Simply this movie makes a complex story, that makes you question so many things. ""Why he is keeping her in his dreams?"" or whatever your question is answering with some well written line. That scene is the key to the whole movie. That line between Cobb and Mal answers all your questions at once.That's why I like this movie so much. Some movies has that potential. Making a complex story that someone could answer with only one sentence. You're waiting for that line for whole content. But most of the contents (I mean movie or TV Series) are not managing that well.Besides the greatness of the storyline this movie has a really great cast. So Acting Performances are also great. Award Winning Cinematography by Wally Pfister was too great. Original Scores by Hans Zimmer was brilliant. Visual Effects are unique. So not only the Screenplay but nearly all the technical details are great.","

"naman-avastol","10 July 2010","What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a ""forger"" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier.There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! What a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If ""Inception"" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan!My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards.","

"D_Burke","13 July 2010","Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. ""Inception"" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""The Cell"" (2000), ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997) & its American remake ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001)), you really can't look away, nor should you.""Inception"" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the ""Matrix"" movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don't get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However, some of the best films I've seen are confusing at first. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) is a film I've seen a couple of times, and still don't understand completely. It still has a major following, though, as I'm positive this movie will. It's an incredibly entertaining movie, but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater.","

"Xstal","31 March 2023","There are those who seek to dive into your mind, take your secrets and whatever else they find, espionage, conspiracy, infiltration, skulduggery, through worlds that are all conjured, well designed. They've been asked to plant a seed, start an idea, change the course of an industrialists career, but it needs dreams within deep dreams, an architect to build the schemes, and the consequences, could be quite severe.Imaginative beyond words, elegantly crafted and constructed, presented and performed by legends of the screen with a great storyline that keeps the viewer constantly engaged and on the edge of their seat - what more do you want out of movies.","

"lhbaker-28783","4 June 2021","Inception is my number one favorite movie off my twelve years on earth! It's absolutely impossible to explain the incredible that Inception has. Inception is Sooooooooo dang exciting, edge of seat, mind blower, and I wish there were more movies like it and more Christopher Nolans out there. Congratulations to the well deserved best director, writer, and producer of films (in my opinion). Also the acting is fabulous, everyone did an amazing job, and Leonardo was fabulous at explaining the dream concept. Also the CGI and effects are amazing. Go watch Inception because it is incredibly amazing in every aspect, and is my number one film of my twelve years on earth. Bravo to the Inception crew and wow at this fabulous movie!","

"planktonrules","2 December 2010","This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this.As for the movie, I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did, however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films, I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special effects. Third, it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in ""Titanic""--his maturity and grit were welcome. Also, seeing the kid from ""Third Rock"" suddenly playing an action hero was great--you'd barely recognize him--or the other grown child actors. Fourth, I loved the ending--it really pulled everything together very well.So why am I not giving the film a glowing review? Well, I am simply not an action film fan. And, the insane pace, TONS of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times. I much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film. Also, while Ken Watanabe is a fine actor, I had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he said--to the point where I wish they'd either dubbed him or had caption! Now this is NOT just because I am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearing--my daughter, too, found his thick accent difficult. On the other hand, Ms. Cotillard was VERY easy to understand and I was surprised how well she controlled her lovely French accent.I could probably go on and on about the film--as it's long, complex and VERY prone to be one to watch and re-watch and discuss with friends. However, at this point, there are already a bazillion reviews and 7 billion people have already gone to see it, so I'll call it a day.Well worth seeing....but perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many.","

"dvc5159","15 July 2010","I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film ""Paprika"" in the whole ""invading dreams"" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"") or the exact opposite (""Doubt"", ""Invictus""). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where ""Inception"" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (""Avatar"" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort ""Shutter Island"". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (""The Dark Knight""). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And ""Inception"" can proudly stand alongside ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)","

"Ch4ndler_B1ng","8 February 2020","Inception is as original as you can get with a sci-fi movie. I feel like it's kind of pointless to compare this to Blade Runner, Aliens, Terminator 2, 2001: A Space Odyssey or any other sci-fi blockbusters, for they're completely different. What Nolan crafted is genius, in my mind he is still yet to make a bad movie, it is now time to get into spoiler territory.Inception is a story about dreams, how you can build anything you want, Nolan took 10 years to write the screenplay and it was definitely worth-while, this is one of the most mind-blowing, nail-biting, epic action packed science fiction movies of all time. All the performances in this film are amazing, the special effects are flawless, the acting is flawless, the story is flawless, the writing is flawless, this is one of a few pictures that just got everything right in all categories, most people saw there is no such thing as a flawless movie and I would 100% love to disagree with them there, all of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen so far have no real flaws. Leonardo DiCaprio+Christopher Nolan= pure gold, these two should definitely collaborate more, Inception just proves that Chris is a cinematic God, from his screenplays, to his production, to his film direction, everything is perfect!You have to imagine it to believe it. Watching it once isn't enough, watching it twice isn't enough, you have got to watch this 10 times or even more to really get the true essence of why this movie is considered to be one of the greatest of all time. It is truly film-making at it's greatest! It is one of the most re-watch-able movies a director has ever put out! It's like Dark Knight, Memento and most of his other work where immediately after you watch it you feel like watching it again.At times it gets confusing because sometimes it feels like it's the real world when it is actually the dream world and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, oh my god! In my opinion it is his greatest performance. And Inception SHOULD HAVE WON BEST PICTURE! Fun fact: This film got nominated for Best Screenplay and many other Oscar nominations, yet they don't nominate the man who put it all together who DIRECTED THE GOSH-DARN MASTERPIECE!I watch this film at least twice a week and to see that Watchmojo put Social Network higher than Inception on their Top 10 Movies of the Decade list p*sses me off! Yeah, it's David Fincher, I get that Watchmojo love David Fincher, but higher than Inception? NAH!If anybody else directed this it would be an average, unoriginal and completely unimaginative piece of work. When Nolan gets his hands on something it is always going to be original, classic and everything great about movies. I'd place this on my top 5 films of the century list, most films on that list would include Nolan films because he is the best director working today and you have to accept that.More will be added soon...","

"hitchcockthelegend","7 April 2011","Inception is written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. The musical score is by Hans Zimmer and Wally Pfister is the cinematographer. Plot finds DiCaprio playing Dom Cobb, a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people. But one day he gets a different offer, one that will enable him to see his estranged children. To get his reward he must enact Inception, the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target. But Inception is thought impossible and should Cobb and his selected team fail? The consequences are unthinkable.There has already been much written and pondered about as regards Inception in the relatively short running time of its life. One can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time. For although it's arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's inescapable that Nolan's movie is this current generation's sci-fi classic. That Nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream, and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process, is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanship.Inception is a film that it's better to know nothing about before venturing into it, and then it asks, well Nolan asks, for your undivided attention. It's neither as confusing as some have painted it, nor does it have any tricks-peek behind the curtain type-up its sleeve. The truth is is that Inception has something for everyone; thematically speaking, and that's before we pore over the special effects that sees Nolan raising the bar considerably. As is the case with twisty high concept movies, interpretations are many, with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie. What forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles, with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over. There's also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with; that of course wont work for everyone, but that is just one of many strands that Nolan dangles for the discerning viewer.If that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the Super Hero genre, rest assured thrill seekers, Inception is also a loud swirly spectacle. The action is raucous, be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups, Nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled roller-coaster ride, aided superbly by Lee Smith's editing and Pfister's perfectly broad photography While Zimmer's score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains (ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr on 12 string) to craft one of the best scores of 2010. As I said, there's something for everyone here, making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbuster.Then there's the strong ensemble cast, led by a quite scintillating performance from DiCaprio. Following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in Shutter Island, DiCaprio has given 2010 two of its best lead performances. Here he gives real depth of emotion, the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on. His unfussy acting is easy to buy into, giving the character the air of believability, he is the glue that binds the whole film together. Murphy is wonderfully vulnerable, very much an axis in the narrative, while Levitt almost usurps DiCaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it. Special praise, too, for Ellen Page. Still in her early 20s, she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress' hands. While Hardy provides brawny levity and Berenger leaves a favourable mark.The Matrix meets Heat and Mission Impossible, only it's written by Phillip K. Dick and Richard Matheson; or something like that. A cracking hybrid movie that's fit to grace any summer and sure to improve and enlighten with further viewings. 9.5/10","

"clipturnity","22 August 2010","I'd like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. 6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. 2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks. Cheers!","

"drakula2005","9 July 2010","I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!","

"marcusdean118","13 July 2010","Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3.","

"chaaa","12 July 2010","What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out? Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don't look for...brains! ""What is the most resilient parasite? An idea"" says Leonardo Di Caprio's character Cobb. Well, Inception is all about ideas. It's all right there in the title. The film central idea revolves around ""Extractors"", who are paid to extract secrets from people's subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival, ""Inception"" is born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, a piece of the film's genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher Nolan's script which, I imagine, is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio's other instant classic this year, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese's film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan's film. There is style, charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy (femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautiful suits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it's OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen!","

"Hitchcoc","31 July 2010","If one goes to an art gallery to see a provocative piece, one sees something new each time. That's what true art is. That's why a black light Elvis is not art. This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels. Great movie.","

"funkyfry","23 August 2010","The film is a disappointment, because it did so little with so much. Basically what you have here is a very interesting sci-fi heist premise; Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are partners who use dream-invasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers (why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit, is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise) while they doze. In exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against Cobb, they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission: to practice ""inception"" on a powerful business scion, that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulation.All of this is great, but unfortunately none of it has any emotional weight. To find that we have to look into the mystery of why Cobb has been in exile, and this plot has to do with his wife (Marion Cotillard) with whom he shared a disastrous and traumatic experience of dream sharing. This is to me where the movie essentially falls apart. It seems like Nolan and the other writers never fully synthesized these two dominant strains in the film, so that most of the time the emotional drama is just getting in the way of the heist film or vice a versa. At no point did it seem to me that the heist was complimenting the drama or vice a versa. And in fact after some very impressive effects sequences during the scenes where Cobb shows his new assistant Ariadne (Ellen Page, too green to hold up her role) a lot of the action becomes outright tedious, never more so than when we're ""treated"" to about a reel or ten minutes of numbing snow-mobile and gunfight action, right at the point where the film should be reaching a climax. It all starts to feel very obligatory, and Nolan is not a good enough action director to make empty content feel like fun.As a basic action/heist movie with sci-fi premise, it still works well enough that I would recommend it as a rental. Nolan works in some of the elements that have made some of his better films work on a higher level, such as the association with totems and icons (the spinning wheel, etc.) and the connection between memory or memory devices and identity. However when all the pieces are laid out, the film seems overly simple and mechanical. The plot is just this -- the guy takes a job, he does the job, he gets to re-unite with his kids. Although he constantly mopes about in a depression because he tried inception on his wife and she died, he has no ethical or moral problem with doing the same thing to Cillian Murphy's character, even though nobody knows the real consequences that could befall or the true motives of Ken Watanabe's character. I was hoping that some larger picture would emerge, but instead this film is politically naive and instead attempts to be dramatic. The constant shots of adorable children playing on the lawn made me feel I was watching a bad Spielberg film. The entire emotional anchor of the film is put on the shoulders of these cute kiddies in true Spielberg fashion. If you don't buy into this ridiculous soft-target hook, then the whole film collapses like DiCaprio's dream world.This isn't a bad or stupid film, but after a while you start to yearn for at least some human warmth or humor, which is almost always missing from Nolan's films. The characters are so sincere that it starts to become suffocating, especially considering how ridiculous the premise is when taken seriously. Basically this is like ""Total Recall"" in terms of ideas and in terms of stupid action scenes, except that it takes itself hugely seriously. It does not become a better film by doing so, nor a more intelligent one.","

"murtaza_mma","26 July 2010","Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/","

"siddhantadlakha","15 July 2010","Dom Cobb leads a highly skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets from people's minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea.Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It has been described by critics as ""a film that rewards intellect"", and I can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help of a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page (Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing photography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling music in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was also set the mood for Nolan's previous film, The Dark Knight.While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind. Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together as beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement each other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both heart- wrenching and heart-pounding. It's a film that manages to engross you with its complexities, yet comes together seamlessly, and will have you at the edge of your seat, quite literally from start to finish.Inception is magnificent.","

"Carl_Tait","25 July 2010","The central idea of ""Inception"" is an interesting one: technology exists to enter other people's dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas. With Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, ""Inception"" is a bloated failure.The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What's going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that's the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn't nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it's time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination. (Okay, that's never gonna happen, but it's *my* dream.)","

"paul2001sw-1","15 January 2011","Ten years ago, Christopher Nolan wrote and directed the brilliant 'Momento', a stunning thriller that pushed the boundaries of storytelling convention. It was great, but still, one couldn't help wondering, where would Nolan go from here? How could he trump this achievement? In fact, although his subsequent films have been praised, they've been less distinctive, but with 'Inception', he returns to his adventurous roots, producing a story that is even more audacious than 'Momento'; and unfortunately, the result is dreadful. And worse than the fact that it doesn't really work is the fact that while it is distinctive, it is distinctive in a very conventional way. Since his early success, Nolan has taken work from big studios, and 'Inception' is no exception; and the result is a Hollywood movie straining desperately to stand out, instead of something more truly independent. in spirit.To make the point in more detail, 'Inception' features a starry cast (I'm, afraid for me, the casting of Leonardo diCaprio has become a clear sign of a poor film with pretensions); an implausibly attractive geeky female assistant; loads of expository dialogue (at one point, it is explained that someone is the most powerful media baron in the world – i.e. they appear to be so powerful that no-one had heard of them); fast pace and Jason Bourne style camera work; sub-'Matrix' style ideas about the nature of reality, superficially intriguing and certainly confusing, but of little philosophical depth; extraordinary special effects; and above all else, a plot comprising an incoherent sequence of random set-piece scenes that seems constructed to showcase said special effects rather than because it makes sense as a story. It may sound like an intriguing idea to have the cast simultaneously fighting for their lives in seven different nested dream-spaces, but in fact, it isn't; multiplying the threat to the heroes only reduces the dramatic impact of each one.To give Nolan credit, he has made a wholly cinematic film; you certainly couldn't imagine this in book form. Sadly it's very hard to imagine it as a screenplay either, or as any sort of story. And it was story, not special effects, that made 'Momento' great; and while that story was highly unusual, it made internal sense. But less is never more in Hollywood; and sadly, more is often just a mess.","

"evanston_dad","11 January 2011","""Inception"" might have been a better movie -- and would certainly have been more entertaining -- had writer/director Christopher Nolan not made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire 2:25 running time explaining itself to its audience.Seriously, the exposition Never. Stops. There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character, which of course was a ham-fisted way of explaining it to us. But even with all of that aggressive exposition, the movie never does make a lot of sense. The result is a lot of busyness -- oh, there's always plenty of stuff going on -- that's nevertheless pretty boring because it's never clear what all of the busyness is for.Nolan has done this to us before. Who the hell came out of ""The Prestige"" with any clue what that movie was about? And even his more narratively coherent films (like ""The Dark Knight"") suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises can't support. ""Inception"" is no exception (ha!). The movie is junk trying to disguise itself as something important and significant. How much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be junk.Grade: C-","

"LeonLouisRicci","20 October 2013","Style over Substance might be a Knee-Jerk Negative Reaction to this Messy Film. But that would be Kind. There is no Style or Substance to Waste many Brain-Cells Considering. The Movie's Conceit is to make You want to Think. Think Not.It tries so Very Hard with its Explanations about Dreams (don't do a drinking game taking a shot every time the word dream is mentioned, you will be dead by intermission). Also Wordy, Incomprehensible Insertions about the Teams ""Method"" used here to Infiltrate and Control the Minds of Corporate Clients (now there is a group we can morally support).This is so Unnecessarily Complicated that it causes Viewer Fatigue, and by Proximation Sleepiness, early on and Waking Up or Recovering from that is not a Given. The Result is just not Caring about Anyone or Anything that is happening on the Screen. What is happening is kind of Drab and Dull for a Dreamscape.If you buy the Premise and go along for the Ride, better fasten your Seat-Belts because it is anything but Smooth. It Bumps and Jumps from Dream to Dream and Layer upon Layer of Intellectual Gobbledygook that is so Very Uninteresting and Without much Pathos. The Music is forever in Swelling Mode and Ripples throughout and is Pretentious and Intrusive.In the End, some have trouble making it that far, there is a ""you decide"" Twist that is not really a Twist because, after all, You Decide.

"technofunkie","12 July 2010","Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","18 July 2010","I have been reading nothing but good reviews on Inception these past few weeks, now I knew from the minute I saw the trailer, I had to see this movie but I didn't know what to expect. If you have seen the trailer to this movie, you know that it doesn't explain too much. But I saw Inception today and all I can say is: Wow! With an incredible cast and amazing director, you just can't go wrong. Inception is a movie that not only makes you think but can start a whole conversation with what you just saw on the screen. It's a very clever story that is told with skill and passion, while you do have to pay attention, I loved that it made me think. One of my friends saw a premiere and told me how he would have to see it again to understand it, but I didn't get that when I saw it today. But I would love to see the movie again, I have no problem with that. Between the performances, the story, the sounds, the editing and the incredible effects, I would love to watch this movie over and over again, it's my favorite film of the year so far.Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible inception. He gathers a group of thieves that will pull this incredible mission off, teaching new comer, Ariadne their amazing world and how to alter it to their liking, but if gone too deep into making the dream into something strange, they could get lost and play limbo between reality and dreams. Even after all the lessons, instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one.To write a dream is a riddle, I love the way this movie was written. Christopher Nolan is one of my new favorite directors, he knows exactly how to write and tell a story. The only small flaw, this is a very small complaint, is that his stories while they're incredible, can also be a bit exhausting. This film is a bit long to warn you in advance, it's a little over two and a half hours long. I felt like there were a couple of things with the story that could have been trimmed, but like I said it's such a small complaint because Inception intrigued me so much. To say that this film will be a contender for the Oscars is pretty much a guarantee with the sound, script, editing and effects. Hopefully I think it might be a runner up for best picture.One of the things I hate to do in a review is brag about a movie because I don't want others to get over hyped with the film and to be disappointed when they see it. But honestly, I don't think there isn't one person I wouldn't recommend this movie too. Inception has some of the most incredible effects mixing The Matrix and The Dark Knight, I think the ""Zero Gravity"" fight scene is one of the most amazing moments I've seen on the big screen. I loved how the story kept you thinking and going, guessing what would happen next and what was going on. A dream within a dream within a dream, you even begin to question with the characters what is a dream and what is reality. With a great cast and excellent director, Inception is everything I wanted and more, once again, Nolan created a masterpiece. Something from his own mind, Inception questions yours' and makes you wonder which world you are part of.10/10","

"akdjreview","23 November 2021","Inception is a beautiful piece of film that has impacted a large part of the film industry. With everything from the actors to the cinematography to the music, this movie without any elaboration perfected almost everything there is.Inceptions slow start is the only weak point of this movie. It begins intensely to then slows down for the next 20 - 30 minutes. While then finishing off as an impeccable film. Nevertheless, this is what brings the film down for me.The director Christopher Nolan managed to create a masterpiece with little to no mistakes. At no point during this intensely long movie did I feel bored. Instead, I was always excited and on my toes intrigued.The acting in this movie was phenomenal. A small number of great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances. It is truly beyond me how Dicaprio didn't win an Oscar for his performance.Meanwhile, also employing the greatest composer in history with Hans Zimmer, the music adds significantly. The music adds an extreme amount of excitement and keeps you constantly interested. Few composers can make you notice the music, but Zimmer succeeds per usual.To finish of the film was astonishingly shot. With beautiful eye-catching scenes. While also containing some incredible action scenes that might be some of the best action I've seen. With a thought-provoking storyline that finishes of with an unbelievable ending.I highly recommend Inception to everyone and I promise you won't be disappointed.","

"sddavis63","30 January 2011","The reality is that my summary basically sums up this movie. It has you questioning reality all the way through; in some ways similar to The Matrix, I suppose, although it's more obvious in this movie that there's questioning about reality to be done. This movie, however, lacks the philosophical/religious elements that The Matrix had, and stands as a pretty formulaic action type movie with the issues about reality thrown in.Essentially, this movie takes place within a dream - or within dreams to be more precise. That's the catch. Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb plays a man who has somehow figured out not only how to get into people's dreams but how to link various people into the same dream, so that the dream becomes reality. Some tragedy has befallen Cobb as a result of this, which is finally revealed, but it does take a while. Cobb and his team are hired by a Japanese businessman who wants them to get inside the dreams of one of his corporate rivals to convince him to break his company up, thus eliminating the rivalry. The move goes from there.It's a confusing movie. There aren't just two layers to it - reality and dream. There are actually multiple layers of various kinds of reality, as characters can enter into dreams within dreams, each successive layer becoming more and more removed from what reality really is - if you get the point. It's imaginative, but it is confusing as you try to sort the layers out. In all honesty, it's not a movie that especially appealed to me. DiCaprio's performance was good but nothing more and there were some really good special effects included in this. Aside from the dream inside a dream inside a dream gimmick, though, this stacks up as an action movie among action movies, and I didn't find it an especially noteworthy addition to the genre. A friend told me it's the sort of movie you have to watch 2 or 3 times to really get your head around it. I think I have a reasonable enough attention span, and if I can't get my head around a movie on the first watching, then it's unlikely I'm going to go back to it again. I will say that this is the sort of movie that's tailor made to produce sequels. The very last scene leaves everything wide open to continue exploring whether or not Cobb is actually back in reality. (Remember, the top was still spinning on the table as the last scene faded out.) The possibilities for sequels are virtually limitless. Everything is based on a dream or dreams. You could have anything from comedy to action to historical epic to outer space adventure and it would all make sense, because it's all a dream or dreams! Still, while I can have some appreciation for the ingenuity of the writers to come up with a story that has the potential to literally go on forever, I didn't find enough here to make me want to look at the inevitable sequels.","

"Doylenf","21 July 2010","I'll be the first one to admit that INCEPTION is the kind of thinking man's thriller that has something going on every second of its two-hour and 28 minute running time. But only director Chris Nolan knows what it's all about and I don't believe I'll find out all the explanations until I get the DVD commentary.It's a heady mixture of sci-fi, comic book stuff and fantasy and all of it is focused on the mastery of dream invasion in order to gather secrets held in the human mind. Foremost among the players is LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, playing his role in a very authoritative manner with no shortage of barking orders and furrowed brow, all highly intense, as he gathers a team around him to investigate the dreamscape.There's plenty of action along the way, interspersed with quieter moments of explanatory dialog so the audience has at least some semblance of what's going on. But the whole concept of the story lacks the kind of credibility that would have made the film more engaging than it really is.Credit the actors with doing their best despite the fact that none of them have roles that are fully fleshed out. And this includes Joseph GORDON-LEVITT, ELLEN PAGE, TOM HARDY, CILLIAN MURPHY, KEN WATANABE and TOM BERENGER.If you're a MATRIX fan, you'll love this one. If not, you may wonder what all the fuss was about.Frankly, I had more fun exploring dream invasion in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, less intellectual but a lot more fun.","

"bob the moo","2 August 2010","The important thing to start out with is to distance yourself from the hype about this film because it will not help you when watching it, nor is any of it totally justified. It seems that any mainstream film (especially at summertime) that manages to at least do something different or clever will be hailed as a masterpiece simply because it is not Transformers 2. So watching it expecting to be amazed is probably the wrong state of mind to be in. Likewise it is probably not great to be expecting something impossible to follow, because again the film is very clearly constructed and even when action is occurring across several ""levels"" at once, I still found it easy to follow.The film is a thriller and, like many great thrillers it is one that is built on an imaginative and clever concept. The world of dream infiltration is well constructed and is also well delivered to the audience; some people near me were muttering and asking confused questions throughout, but personally I found it easy to follow for the most part – and not because I'm smart but because the film does a good job of bringing the viewer into the ideas and concept. In terms of being an action movie, the second half of the film does pick this up well and the race against time across all of the dream levels, with the editing bringing it all together well so that you don't lose what is happening and indeed the movement of time and the importance of the relative events are clearly understood to produce tension. Although the dream worlds are a bit too ""ordinary"" at times (most of our dreams are filled with things that don't make any sense or have echoes of things, rather than detailed cityscapes and gun battles) there is creativity in the visual design and in particular a Matrix-esquire battle in a spinning corridor is thrilling to watch.To its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not. The importance of Cobb's subconscious and in particular his own gnawing guilt over the death of his wife initially appears to be just a way of having a repeatable ""baddie"" turning up in various places throughout the film, but actually she is well used to introduce doubt and alternative interpretations to the film. As everywhere else, the ending of the film was met with groans that there would not a confirmation of the ending. Personally I think that ""was the real level actually a dream"" is just an idea planted by the director to keep the audience from simply finishing the film and walking away from it and that the presented reality was actual reality. I can understand why some have disliked this because it could appear like Nolan is going ""or was it?"" without providing much more than the question, but I choose to see this as just another tease, which he is perfectly allowed to do since the whole film is about trying to get others to doubt their reality and change their own minds by themselves (although not really).The cast deliver well. DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more accessible to the viewer. Gordon-Levitt is memorable for his action scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot less to do. Page provides the viewer with someone to ""come in"" with and she works that angle well. Hardy, Watanabe and Rao round out the team well. Some of the bigger names had the potential to be distractions by virtue of ""oh look its x"" but Caine, Berenger, Haas and Postlethwaite didn't really do that even if their actual screen times were minimal compared to the recognisability of their faces. Cotillard works very well to have her character vary across levels and contexts and I liked her better than I thought I would.I'm not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is a very good one. If anything the elevation of this film is more to do with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released are, but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some ways to maybe counter that. The concept and ideas are well constructed and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster normally doesn't – pay attention. Doesn't quite live up to the hype but it is still a very good and engaging film.","

"RIK-22","26 July 2010","I have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film, takes some doing.Here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film. You have great special effects, a sci-fi conundrum, beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It's an empty shell of a film. There is no tension; you couldn't care less about any of the characters, why were they even motivated to do what they did. Helping a corporation get ""one over"" on another corporation is hardly saving the human race.When you operate in a dream environment, where you can't die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about, who cares what happens. All the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless. By the way, why does Hollywood still keep filming action scene's an inch away from every characters nose? It's impossible to see what's going on, so many films are ruined by this. Watch and learn from the Matrix, take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what's going on.So 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending, is a million miles from being a good film. How anyone in their right mind can give this 10/10, it's boring and pointless. A film has stir the soul, has to grab you, you need to feel for the characters. Can anyone, honestly say, they cared about anyone on show here.By the way, here's an idea, why don't you bring the children (who haven't aged a minutes since you last saw them) to you, if you can't go to the US.I know the end scene was trying to be ambiguous, but the fact his father, who lives in Paris, is bizarrely there in the US to meet him (how did he know) and the children look identical to every dream sequence they appeared in, means there wasn't much doubt.In the end there is nothing at stake for anyone, so a pointless movie. I suspect Nolan will continue to get praise, but I can't really say I've got excited about any of his movies. They all leave me cold. They are not terrible, just there's nothing really there, no substance.","

"moviexclusive","13 July 2010","""The mind is like an iceberg, it floats with one-seventh of its bulk above water."" -Sigmund Freud Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" plays very much like its subject matter described so aptly above by Freud. On your first viewing, you will quite possibly only grasp just a fraction of its complexity, but the brilliance of what this reviewer proclaims as Nolan's masterpiece lies in how engaging it is- even though you cannot quite fully comprehend what Nolan is trying to say. Indeed, it may take multiple viewings for one to absorb completely his audacious new creation that dares to tackle as dense and intricate a subject as that of dreams.It isn't easy to understand the nature of dreams, particularly because they seem to defy logic. The same can probably be said of some of the elements in ""Inception"", but in order for one to understand what dreams really are, one has to first accept that they are not part of the conscious mind, and therefore cannot be understood by rationality. Freud proposed that the rational mind is just that one-seventh of the iceberg that we see, and the rest of the mind is made up of the preconscious and the unconscious. Freud also believed that dreams were the road to the unconscious and existed in the preconscious, a state between the conscious and the unconscious mind.It is in this context that Nolan invites his audience to approach ""Inception"". Here, Nolan imagines a world of corporate espionage where a thief enters a person's mind during his dreams to steal ideas. This process he terms ""extraction"", done by a team of people who design the architecture of the dreams, plant several people including the subject into the dream, forge identities within the dream and then proceed to steal the idea from the subject. Leonardo DiCaprio is the master thief of them all, Dom Cobb, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt his long-time right-hand man Arthur.But this latest mission is different- a tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants him to plant an idea (so termed inception) within a rival's (Cillian Murphy) mind in order that he will break up his ailing father's business empire after he takes over. Cobb agrees to this dangerous mission- a fugitive wanted for the murder of his wife, Saito promises that if Cobb succeeds, he will wipe Cobb's slate clean so he is allowed to return to the United States to see his children. So Cobb begins assembling his team- the architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), the forger Earnes (Tom Hardy) and the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao)- think of it like a heist, only much more complicated.As Cobb explains the rules of the game to his team while preparing for their mission, Nolan is too establishing the rules of his game to his audience- what it means to die in a dream, why one can feel pain even when you're in a dream, the significance of the people you see in your dream, the difference between dream time and real time. Not to spoil the experience to you- but suffice to say that there are many many such rules that Nolan plays by in his movie. Those who have had some experience in the study of dreams will likely grasp this more quickly, but those who have not may take more time to accept the logic and regulations behind Nolan's world- hence the multiple viewings.Regardless, there is no doubt that it is engrossingly intriguing. All this takes place in the first half of the movie, which sets the stage for the inception itself in the latter half, an ingenious conceit set within a world of layered dreams that defies any description. Nolan uses the interconnectedness of these elaborate dream layers to intercut several breathtaking action spectacles - the storming of a vault within the Arctic within a zero-gravity fight along a hotel corridor within a high-speed vehicular freeway chase. Each of these would be thrilling in their own right, but with Nolan's vision, Wally Pfister's expansive photography and Lee Smith's fine editing, the simultaneous unfolding of these set-pieces is utterly riveting.Besides grand action, Nolan also delivers heart-wringing moments courtesy of Cobb's troubled past with his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who threatens to wreak havoc on his missions by surfacing from his unconscious in the most inopportune manner. We're kept in the dark most of the time, believing that Mal is an insidious presence Cobb is unable to eradicate, but Nolan's reveal towards the end of the film that puts into perspective Cobb's unresolved guilt delivers an emotional finish that will leave you floored.As with his previous movies, Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors who can best embody the characters in his films. While DiCaprio's role here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island, there's no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt. The rest of the supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly- Joseph Gordon-Levitt radiates confidence and suavity, Ellen Page displays suitable wit and grit, and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking performance.But ""Inception"" is Nolan's vision through and through- and in fact, a visionary director and a master filmmaker at that. Many years Nolan spent refining his screenplay, and it shows in the great detail and complexity that makes ""Inception"" both an intellectual and visceral enjoyment- just take the names of the various characters, each of which have a special significance. With ""Inception"", Nolan invites you to open your mind to possibilities- possibilities of alternate realities, of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most importantly, of the power of imagination. It is that rare gem of a film that is so multi-layered, so profound and so fascinating that you'll want to experience it again immediately after you've seen it- just so you can fully appreciate its genius.","

"howemonika","12 July 2010","I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like most of DiCaprio's films, it blew me away.Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult). The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay. Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending.","

"dario_van_kuschn","20 July 2010","I cannot ignore facts. I cannot ignore mistakes and plot holes, bad writing, or bad marketing. I cannot ignore hype, especially when it's already on the IMDb top 250, it received praise from critics, cashed in a lot of money, and people call it stunning and unforgettable. The simple truth is that Inception does not live up to the hype. Let me start with the trailer. All the coolest things (the folding city, the collapsing cliffs, the train in the street) are totally unessential to the plot. None of that takes more than a few seconds. So why did they put them on all the posters as well? Nevermind. I'll move on to the real problems of the movie.So I heard all these people saying how complex the movie is. How I'll need to watch it twice. How the shocking ending will blow my mind. I knew exactly what that ""shocking ending"" would be half way through the film. The very last paragraph of this review deals with the ending. It's not exactly a spoiler but you can skip it if you don't want to know anything.Cobb (DiCaprio) takes on a mission to implant a thought into Fischer's (Murphy) mind. As a reward, his contractor Saito (Watanabe) will clean his record with the LAPD. Cobb is wanted for the murder of his wife and consequently he can't return to USA and see his children. Throughout the movie, this is Cobb's main inner conflict, that before he fled the country, he didn't get a chance to see the kids' faces and he wants to see them again. Michael Cain has a very small role as their grandpa and DiCaprio's father-in-law. Why doesn't Cain take the kids someplace so they could be with their father? People move all the time. Or why doesn't he send Cobb some home movies if he wants to see their faces so much? They could even have video calls and all that stuff. It's a long distance relationship but it's something. Well, apparently no one thought of that, and so the main character's main motivation for his actions makes no sense. As for acting, DiCaprio was good. But if you've seen Shutter Island, You've seen a third of Inception. Dead wife, small kids, a sense of loss, a pretty wooden house in a field, all those flashbacks Teddy had in Shutter Island it's all in Inception. Minus the funny Boston accent.The mission these mind thieves embark on is to plant an idea into a rich guy's mind. This is called inception. Hence the title, I guess. Everyone says it's impossible to do, so you know they are going to succeed in the end. Inception is essentially a heist movie, but instead of getting into a vault, Cobb's team has to get inside someone's mind – which happens to look like a vault. The supposed complexity of the movie boils down to the idea of a dream within a dream. Basically, imagine that once you are plugged inside the matrix, you plug yourself into yet another, deeper, matrix. There, I just explained the super complex plot of the movie. But in case that wasn't enough, there is Ellen page's character, Ariadne. She is the obligatory new member of the team that is introduced to represent the audience and their questions. I'm fine with that. Every movie has one of those uninitiated people. The thing is, she understands everything too quickly and becomes suddenly becomes the most competent character. Pretty convenient, if you ask me.Let me finally get to the mission. It's the worst part of the movie. Watanabe wants Murphy, who just inherited a huge corporation, to dissolve it, because it was going to become a huge monopoly. So Watanabe hires DiCaprio to plant the idea of splitting the company in Murphy's mind. And so they do that. For two and a half hours. But I don't care if he splits the big company or not. Why should I care if Murphy has a bigger company than Watanabe? The stakes of the movie aren't high, they are nonexistent. I am not given any reason to care about whether or not they succeed. I'm only given more and more action set pieces to look forward to, and a lot of cool slow motion and zero gravity fights reminiscent of The Matrix, but I'm not given any reason to care for what is happening. I liked Watanabe's character only because I like Ken Watanbe. As for Saito himself, I don't give a damn if his competitor destroys his company or not. They don't tell us what consequences it would have, they don't show us what happens with the company, they don't do anything with this initial idea. Which is strange, because the movie is all about ideas being important. Okay, so I didn't like the plot and the acting was nothing new. What about the rest? Hans Zimmer's unremarkable score works well with the scenes but it would be super boring to hear on its own. The visual effects are good but since all the coolest city-folding scenes were so short, there wasn't really that much to do. The zero gravity stuff was done well, I'll give them that. Cinematography was good, bordering on too much shaky camera.Here's the paragraph about the ending:The big ending is that you are supposed to be unsure what was a dream and what was reality. If it was real, then it's stupid because DiCaprio had dozens of ways to be with his kids without making things so incredibly complicated. The movie is supposed to make you think, but if you think about it the whole plot falls apart. If it was a dream, then it's a stupid cop out on Nolan's part. An excuse for all the things that didn't make sense. It was all a dream, so screw you, audience.","

"Egg_MacGuffin","19 July 2010","Unless you call this movie a masterpiece. Then you are.Damn 1,000 word limit. Gotta make this quick.Spoilers.The film is 2.5 hours long, yet feels like 5.2, and there are a few reasons for this. One of which is the fact that a preponderance of the first act is amateurish, conflict-free exposition, which does not bode well for repeat viewings.The ""learning about the dream world"" scene is atrocious. No conflict. Both Leo and Page's characters already knew what was being explained. The similar ""learning about the matrix"" scene in The Matrix did it right by having one character not know anything. Plus, there was conflict. Neo gets his ass kicked and fails to make the building jump. Much more entertaining.There's another problem with the whole section of bending the landscape where Leo explains the negative aspects of altering the dream world. The closest we get to seeing the dream world altered was Leo becoming Mr. Charlie, yet the most that happens then is a bunch of extras turn and look at Leo. That's it. The idea was not exploited. You literally have to go out of your way to miss that opportunity. Hell, that Mr. Charles scene is shorter than the scene that explains why altering the dream world is bad! Let's not forget this whole idea of one corporation one-upping another has absolutely no personal ramifications for anyone on screen or in the audience. It would have greatly amped up the internal conflict if Leo had to struggle with the notion that helping the guy who could help him would endanger someone else close to him, or us, or someone else. ANYTHING could have worked better than an energy contract that means less to me than my neighbor's bath mat. Come on. The totems were handled very poorly. All we need to know is their purpose. We don't need to know anything else, yet the film keeps piling on needless information.If this is a heist film, where is the threat of being caught? A van falls for an endless amount of time. Joseph Gordon-Levitt floats bodies down a hallway for half an hour, real-time. The guy from Bronson does his thing, whatever the hell that was. These are not complex tasks or events, but rather straight-forward in nature. Dragging them out for a solid chunk of the film is what creates the glacial pace and makes a long film seem even longer.Inception has no real villain. You can make a case for Cotillard, but she is an internal enemy. She never takes a ""physical"" presence and never threatens anyone except Leo. Everyone else is dealing with faceless assassins. That makes it feel distant from the rest of the action. It doesn't even have anything to do, emotionally, with Leo's goal of getting home to see his kids. None of this is tied together. Leo didn't even know what the hell was going on with Cillian and never even knew of the outcome until after the fact. He's separated from the physical manifestation of his goal for a majority of the film. I ended up not caring if the plan succeeded. If it was all somehow tied together, the audience would be able to experience that great emotional catharsis that everyone was talking about...but that didn't happen.In fact, Leo is so separated from the actual plot that you can literally put Levitt in his place and not even need the hero in the dream world at all! Hell, you can even put Page there, since all she does after designing the boring and lifeless dream worlds is hang out with the guys and tell Leo he's crazy. I really wish she had something else to do besides play the part of the fifth wheel.Leo's lack of involvement in the main action of the story creates a 'so what?' moment when the problem is solved for him, and I can think of absolutely no reason why the hero should not be the one to conquer the main conflict. Brody kills the shark in Jaws. He doesn't send Hooper and Quint out to do his dirty work while he stays behind to deal with his fear of water. It's integrated. The hero is forced into dealing with the physical, and in turn, but learn to conquer his internal fears before he can conquer his external opponent. This is Screen writing 101, Lesson 1, and Nolan got that wrong. That's why I don't believe the reports that he spent 10 years writing the script since it only took me 148 minutes to figure out exactly what was wrong with it.Not to mention the conceit that to enter someone else's dream and control it means that you would have to control your own subconscious, which they state elsewhere is impossible. Way to go, genius.Pretty much everything this film does wrong, The Matrix does right. Watch that instead.PS: The 'taking a scene from the middle and putting it at the beginning' gag reached its peak effectiveness in 2002 and has absolutely no place in modern films. It's getting as bad as that tired old 'It's all a dream' scenario. Oh, wait...","

"spaaw","17 July 2010","Many of us, not least those who populate the online world with movie reviews, observations and criticisms, are aware of Chris Nolan's raw talent. Memento broke onto the screen a decade ago and provided us with a spectacle in story telling so rare that it dumbfounded us. Since then, Nolan has gained huge popularity with his revival of the Batman franchise, and even more so with the stunning Dark Knight - that still has yet to relinquish its grip on modern day cinema - with the genius of The Prestige sandwiched in between.None of this, however, could have quite prepared us for the spectacle that is INCEPTION. A script that has been worked on for over a decade, Nolan's endeavours are inescapable in its pure complexity and brilliance - quite simply, one of the best film story lines audiences will have encountered in their lifetime. All this is supplemented superbly by the film's ensemble cast - DiCaprio's performance cannot easily be done justice without seeing it. With this and Shutter Island, now must be the time for his first Oscar - he has asserted his place as truly one of the best actors currently working. All reviews will confirm that Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy and Ellen Page back his performance up superbly with well-worked turns. Inception's action sequences play out wonderfully, being - along with the comic relief and back-stories - an integral part of the film's unravelling, whilst we remain rooted to the film's emotional stakes, which give immense purpose to the film's complex and layered narrative.Our protagonist battles with both outer and inner demons in his quest for redemption. The unique concept of entering dreams offers the opportunity not only for a unique species of heist but also a way to dig deeper and deeper into one's subconscious, and the ability to plant an idea which could define that person, or destroy them. In theaters around the world, Nolan uses his dynamic skill to plant an idea in our minds which together allows us to experience the very dream- share the film explores, one which will remain with us long after the film's emotional climax. Inception is a cinema experience so audacious, so incredible, and in the end so gratifying, that it truly is unmissable, and will remain a benchmark for many filmmakers in years to come.10/10.","

It's a science fiction film that takes dream analysis to several new levels. In the film, it's Leonardo DiCaprio's job to put his clients to sleep, then enter their dream subconscious and find out information they need. It gets much more complicated, but for the sake of saving your brain, that's the plot in a nutshell.Nolan recruited an all-star supporting cast, including Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in one of his first dramatic roles. While everyone tries very hard to give serious, dramatic performances to thrill and move the audience, it doesn't always come across that way. Marion seems like she's trying to remember how to speak English, Joe seems like he's desperately trying to get the audience to forget he was ever in 3rd Rock from the Sun, and Leo looks like he's out of tears and thinks a wrinkled face will be just as convincing.The special effects of the film absolutely deserved the hype and the Academy Award, as scenes literally bend and crumble into one another as the different dream sequences blend. If you love movies with incredible special effects, this is a must-see.If you even mention the title to anyone who's seen it, it'll no doubt spark an hour long discussion about what the story and ending meant. I watched the film, and with the exception of a couple of little details during the dream-within-a-dream sequences, I understood it perfectly. To me, the ending was not one that needed discussion, so I don't quite understand the reason behind everyone's endless debates. However, if that type of story intrigues you, you might want to watch this one with your friends so you can stay up late afterwards and talk about what you think it meant.","

"bennyhagen","24 July 2010","You have this basic idea and the story, they are very good. And boy did the have money. And the CGI is spectacular, yes.Further on this:Inception is constantly VERBALLY explaining what is happening, why it is happening, how it's relating to things explained earlier and so on. The rules, the plot, the inner conflicts. Even at the 2/3rd of the movie, they are still explaining basic rules. I don't see why this was necessary as most of it is repetition. You get the same stuff over and over again, supposed you didn't get it for the first time. And again: VERBALLY. Exactly like in your average, random Venezuelan soap opera.Inception does almost not have any scenes. As far as I'm concerned, movies are about scenes. Here, you'll only be able to remember certain sequences, because it's all just one big a montage of sequences. It's the montage of the master-plan from Oceans 11 for 150 minutes and it's exaggerating.The score is non-stop blaring, all the darn time, even when people are just talking to each other, music is building up constantly to give you the perception, that there are serious things going on. It's just annoying, painful for the ears and pointless. Generally important scenes are in no contrast to basic scenes. It's one big video clip.Characters. I don't remember a single name, as there is no kind of character development going on here. It's just some well dressed people. All the dialog is used up, for basic explaining like ""for dummies"", rather then building character, relationships, or just being generally cool dialog. Occasional tries sounds like tag-lines or slogans while being just plain unintelligent. Also, this is leaving the actors no space to - well - act... which is a waste of the great cast.Now all these things are very amateur scriptwriting mistakes, or if you prefer: it's a stupid movie. But no one seems to notice as Nolan does everything to convince you that you are watching something meaningful.The blaring music and the hectic editing, the fact that there are permanently 3 scenes of action cut together into one sequence underlined by an incredibly severe score, it's just there to distract. Because in fact the movie has nothing new to show us. Separate the sequences and you have the most basic and outdated action b-movie there is. Car chase. Fire fight. Explosion. Present it confusing enough so it seems complex. Same goes for the plot. The rules of the dream world are not complicated at all, you are absolutely able to sum it up in two sentences, just try. The Matrix set up it's world with a 10 minute sequence and we all got it where the whole theme is about equally, or more complex. Now Nolan is either deliberately confusing people for effect or simply because he doesn't have the skills as a scriptwriter to set up a movie. Neither of the versions seems too noble, but I guess it's a combination of those.Now the fact, that no one really seems to have noticed ALL THIS this is just a total riddle to me. Even famous film critics praise this movie as ground breaking and brilliant and I just can't see, where I am totally stupid, or why I'd construe all these mistakes into the movie, when in reality, they just weren't there.It's just malpractice, as what you have here is basic movie making rules ignored in the most inelegant fashion possible and then compensating for it with - well - money. Don't get me wrong, it's not knowing the rules and then breaking them, it just looks like not knowing the rules. It's what you could expect a first year student at a mediocre film school to do where his teacher then asks him to start all over again, with the first book. And it's just so ""in your face"". For most of the time, there is really nothing more then cutaways, the characters describing what is happening and Hans Zimmer smashing while you see expensive CGI and explosions.But everything just seems so damn serious and exclusive and the music is really dramatic. How could this movie not be good, right? But it's a trick. It's the concept of visceral over-stimulation brought to a new level and I'm shocked that it works to the point where after almost a century of film making THIS is regarded as one of the best movies of all time.IMDb TOT 250 #8.

"deepfrieddodo","1 February 2021","An incredibly unique film which deserves its plaudits purely for the intelligent world created. Whilst extremely complex, the 'science' allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part, although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point, for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene. It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.Visually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling. Having said that, it is really one of a kind, at least at this level, and so everyone should see Inception, if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into.","

"DICK STEEL","15 July 2010","Action aside, there will be some who will liken this to the Wachowski Brothers' Matrix, given its similarities in combining science fiction with philosophical existentialism issues, with cutting-edge action seemingly beyond its time. Nolan goes one up however, with this attempt as he, like Neo, goes beyond the computerized world of the Matrix, where it's still a construct led by binary ones and zeroes, good and evil battling it out under black and white rules. Rules that one cannot escape from since they are what binds our universe together. Here Nolan goes into that untapped power of the mind, the dream worlds that we create in our subconscious, where the dreamer has everything in his subtle control, where anything goes as far as the imagination dare venture beyond physical limitations and rules.This allowed for such a film to be created from a simple idea with a bank heist premise having its skill-based assembled team break into unsuspecting victims to steal ideas locked away in the mind. Nolan loves to tease and test the audience, not lulling us into complacency, with Inception beginning in the thick of the action with tremendous questions being asked as we try and digest the multitude of information thrown at us, with the whys and the what ifs answered in due course, needing to pay attention to subtle details, ideas and concepts to make the film work.We follow Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his lieutenant Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as information hackers and social engineers of the new age, offering their services as the black and white ops type either to teach corporate honchos how to defend against like-minded and skilled peers, or to be engaged by these same industrialists to steal information from the competition. With the promise of being able to return to the USA without being arrested at immigration, Cobb accepts the challenge posed by the Japanese Saito (Ken Watanabe), to assemble an A-Team to plant a seed of thought and an idea, known as an inception, into his business enemy Robert Fischer Jr (Cillian Murphy). It's an almost impossible task, but the promise to see his kids again makes Cobb recruit the likes of Ariadne the architect (Ellen Page), Yusuf the chemist (Dileep Rao), and Eames (Tom Hardy) the thief.Like the layers that the characters navigate through, the film is equally layered with engaging subplots that expand the depth and breadth of the characters involved, the largest one involving the mystery behind the disappearance of Cobb's wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) who now lives only in Cobb's subconscious, and always find a way to thwart his grand plans, making Cobb more of a liability with this unspoken handicap that gets worse as the challenges facing the team grows. The story unfolds like a planning of that perennial big bank heist job, with conflicts between members, the building of skills and the meticulous planning all coming together with so many external variables, that seeks to test the skills of every member to the extreme. And that's what makes the film so terribly engaging, while dealing with emotions and romance, obsession and selfishness, which if I may jest, seem to reflect a side of modern day relationships where sometimes one can get tired and need to seek an exit from constantly being with someone else, 24 hours a day, with nobody around.DiCaprio with his name sprawled over the poster above the other cast, delivers that pitch perfect flawed lead character that Nolan has a knack to create, and brought to life by DiCaprio's performance, having the actor showcase a wide range of emotions as a man desperate to hold onto what he deems dear, with hidden secrets so jealously guarded, living and repeating his pain through the constant re-visits to his memory, breaking all rules of the game as told to his protégé Ariadne. Ellen Page holds her own against the seasoned thespian in two scenes which is bound to generate some gasps for the special effects generated as she picks up the necessary skills for the job, in what would be a Neo-like discovery of how seductive a limitless world could be.I can't rave enough of how Nolan got to elicit wonderful performances from his cast of stars, where little nuances can mean so much, without even saying a word. A flick of the eyebrow, a glance at someone, paint that picture to tell a thousand words. Better yet, Nolan's own ability to hold your attention with his storytelling ability and delivering no less than four stunningly created realms all happening simultaneously, each with another as a constraint or a condition to kickstart a chain of events. You're always left guessing whether the team can accomplish their mission, and there's always that constant threat of danger that seeks to derail everything they thought of in their combined state of comatose, What George Lucas does with those simultaneous theatres of war in the finale of each of his Star Wars films, Nolan does it better with just this one, as he puts that grip around you as we flit from one stage to another. There's absolutely nothing quite like the experience of having seen something great, and want to savour it all over again soon.Inception is best experienced on the big screen, and Christopher Nolan has done the ultimate in performing just what the characters of Inception had set out to do, sowing the seed of a premise and concept that holds so much promise, then delivering that promise with aplomb, so much so that you'll want to continue living in that world created by the cognitive senses interpreting what's on screen, then fantasizing on it a lot more with the subconscious. Inception is definitely one of the best this year, if not THE best film of 2010 thus far. Don't miss this film!","

"Turfseer","7 March 2011","Before Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to play the lead part in 'Inception', he spent months with Christopher Nolan trying to improve the script. It was at DiCaprio's insistence that the part he was playing, Cobb, the corporate dream extractor, had to have a more beefed up internal arc. Otherwise, Inception would turn out to be another shallow, action adventure thriller. Despite Cobb's triumph over his internal demons (particularly the way in which he expunges his dead wife, who has been haunting him in his subconscious), Inception is much more an exploration of the mechanics of dreaming than a chronicle of emotional catharsis. At the basic level, Inception can be divided into four distinct parts: Intro, Exposition, Journey and Resolution. The Intro consists of the initial scene, a flashback where Cobb must save his employer, a sleazy Japanese businessman, Saito, now far advanced in years, who has been stuck in a limbo-like purgatory for decades, unaware that he was mortally wounded in someone else's dream. It's a nice, little compact scene where we see a near-dead Cobb, washed up on a beach and dragged into Saito's fortress compound. A gun is left on the table in front of Saito and we're trying to figure out whether Saito is going to kill Cobb or himself. Cut to the next scene where Cobb and his associate are involved in a trying to extract information from a much younger Saito inside one of his dreams, as they all sleep on a bullet train somewhere in Japan. Apparently, Saito was expecting the dream extractors and informs them that this is their 'audition'; the extractors' 'architect', the guy in charge of designing the dreamworld, somehow lets things get out of control when a mob of men invade the room where they're all staying, and Saito later has his thugs toss the architect off the roof of a heliport. Despite the botched job, Saito is impressed that Cobb and his partner are able to move through different 'levels' in the dreamworld. Cobb's 'audition' could have been compressed into one or two minutes but Nolan insists on illustrating every aspect of his convoluted plot. We finally arrive at the film's inciting incident: Saito's proposal to Cobb that he enter the dream world of his business rival, Fischer, and plant a suggestion in his subconscious, leading to the dissolution of the rival's entire business empire. 'Inception' is the reverse of what Cobb and his team have been trained to do—extracting information and Cobb has doubts about successfully carrying out Saito's proposal. But when Saito promises to pull some strings, enabling Cobb to return to the United States, despite murder charges hanging over his head, Cobb can't resist jumping at the chance to see his two children again.The next part of 'Inception', the 'exposition', takes about an hour. This is where Cobb assembles his new carefully selected ""Mission Impossible"" superstar team who will penetrate Fischer's mind and plant the suggestion to break up his dying father's business empire. Nolan's explanation of the mechanics of the dreamworld is so complicated, that he has Cobb explain it to his new architect, a naive graduate student who manages to acquit herself rather well despite facing major obstacles inside multiple dreamworlds. Nolan manages to violate a major tenet of screen writing technique: Show don't tell. Unfortunately, during these expository sequences, there's a lot more 'tell' than 'show'. Yes, there is a rather neat scene (reminiscent of an M. C. Escher illustration), where one Paris landscape folds on top of another but most of the visuals are much more mundane: for example, a speeding locomotive appears out of nowhere during a car chase on a Paris street.Much has been written about the 'journey' aspect of 'Inception'. Critics seem to be impressed by the three dreamworlds the 'dream team' penetrates, coupled with the way in which they're able to return to reality—the so-called 'kicks', where a huge sound or explosion propels them through the different levels back up to the surface. Nolan, however, serves up some of the dullest and derivative landscapes that our 'heroes' must navigate through—in fact, these so-called dreams don't look like dreams at all. Take Level 1—just a typical shoot em up with faceless bad guys chasing the 'good guys'. As for level 2—I felt I was watching a parody of Space Odyssey, with our dreamers floating through a hotel without the benefit of gravity. Finally, I have heard 'Level 3', compared to 'Ice Station Zebra', the schlocky 60s action film set in the Arctic.Inception's Resolution is as unsatisfying as the earlier parts of the film. What are we to make of Cobb? Just because he has made this deal with Saito and it enables him to see his children, does not mitigate the fact that the whole plan to literally change Fischer's mind, is reprehensible. After all, shouldn't have Cobb walked away when Saito had his men murder the first architect? Cobb, by and large, remains a tainted and unsympathetic character, precisely because he looks the other way when he's quite aware that Saito has committed murder.We're also told (by Saito) that the breakup of Fischer's empire is a good thing but should we take his word for it? He's a thug and Nolan has provided us nothing to go on to evaluate the nature of the Fischer empire. Finally, why does Fischer cry at his father's deathbed? He's just learned that his father put his mother in a mental institution so shouldn't he be angry? Or are those tears of joy so that he can be now 'his own man'?The bulk of 'Inception' is merely a pastiche of mediocre action adventure espionage thrillers dating back to the 60s when the genre was in full bloom. The long-winded 'B' story, Cobb's tortured machinations in trying to literally kick his dead wife out of his subconscious mind, merely serves to distract us from the hollowness of the overall plot.","

"dbborroughs","18 September 2010","Its all flash and little substance in Christopher Nolan's over long story of people able to go into the dreams of others.I'm not going to go into the plot, partly to play fair with those of you who haven't see the film, but Nolan has constructed a film so needlessly messy that its damn near impossible to summarize simply.Yes the visuals are spectacular, though most of them are obviously CGI creations. There are also fewer than you would think since the dream weavers of the story have to keep thing real in order to achieve their ends.For me the story isn't much of anything,certainly not enough to support a two and a half hour tale. The deepness of Nolan's ""philosophy"" is also over done, and ultimately meaningless since Nolan is on record as saying it's all been made up and exists purely to drive his plot.I like the story I just wish it didn't take so long to get where it was going.I also hate that Nolan changes the rules about half way in as a means of making things more exciting. Its not fair and I was so annoyed I walked out of the theater the first time I saw the film.Good not great, its worth a look see down the road.","

"dharmendrasingh","18 November 2010","Christopher Nolan's sci-fi thriller might well have been called 'Deception', or better still, 'Multiple Deception', such is the effect the film has. The concept is original, no question. However, it does borrow from classic American films such as 'Citizen Kane' and 'The Matrix'.Many film geeks – and ordinary punters – have described this film as 'very complicated'. The truth is it's just tremendously detailed. For his job, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), while in a dream state, steals ideas from people ('Extraction'); however, the film concerns itself with him implanting an idea into a person's mind, i.e. 'Inception'. That's the plot in one crude line.However, to reduce the plot, which took a modern master nearly eight years to flesh out, to one purely about mental thievery would be unfair. It is the minutiae which are meant to dazzle.Business tycoon, Saito (Ken Watanabe) needs Cobb to perform the inchoate process of Inception on another businessman's son, Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), to prevent his father's energy company from becoming a monopoly. After Fischer Snr passes, it is believed that he will betroth the business to his son, so the idea Cobb and his team must implant is for him to repudiate his father's will.The technology used to carry out the subconscious subterfuge is never explained. When we catch glimpses of it, it looks like a child's primitive science-kit thrown into a briefcase. But this is not meant to be the focus.For all its cerebral conceit, at the film's core are two emotional stories. One is of Cobb's wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who spends her time stalking Cobb's subconscious mind and thereby sabotaging his missions. The other is between Fischer and his father, whose relationship is strained.We saw DiCaprio mature in Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed'. Here he permanently loses the schoolboy image and becomes a man. The ensemble acting is good, however, most of the main characters seem far too young to do anything let alone steal and implant ideas, and Michael Caine's turn as yet another sage is fast becoming trite.The computer-generated imagery is, as expected, top-notch, though the action scenes would be clichéd if they were not embellished by Hans Zimmer's superbly suspenseful music.Ultimately, Nolan asks us to absorb too much gobbledegook too quickly. Perhaps he was being pretentious, perhaps not. Either way, I lost interest somewhere in the second half.Within days of the film's release, thousands of cinema-goers cast their votes on this venerated website, ensuring that the film became, at least in their minds, one of the top five greatest films of all time. So much for polls.www.scottishreview.net","

For me it's up there with The Matrix, it truly is that good.It's one of those films that improves with subsequent viewings, as there is always something new to pick up, some detail that you may have missed the previous time.This film packs some big punches, it dazzles in every avenue, one of the biggest features, the visuals, those special effects look remarkable still. The scenes of the streets folding over, just an incredible moment, surreal.Another incredible feature, the acting, Cain, Cotillard, Murphy, Hardy all fantastic, as for Leonardo DiCaprio, I still regard it as one of his best ever performances, he's phenomenal, he commands your attention.Have you ever dreamed you're dreaming?? What a thing to contemplate.Personally, this film is in my top 10.10/10.","

Only his latest case is not as simple, instead of taking an idea, he must implant one; however Cobb is a man whose own sub-conscience is in disarray as his dead wife threatens to destroy him.I thought originally when I watched the trailer...""Interesting...But I've seen this somewhere before?""And then as I watched the film it hit me..'Paprika!', Paprika is a anime were a therapist enters the minds of patients to distinguish the problem.I am not saying that the film is a complete copy, because its not...However, the complexity of the film is quite confusing at times, even for a life long sci-fi fan; I guess that was the allure when you consider the many, many positive and glowing reviews. I enjoyed some of the action sequences, but it did not really keep me on the edge of my seat. Cillian Murphy and Ken Wattanbe, were the true stars in my opinion, they played their roles very well, while Leonardo DiCaprio was one dimensional, even though he was supposed to be the most complex and intriguing character in the film.","

1. Hans Zimmer's music is hauntingly beautiful, probably my favorite movie score ever.2. The premise is unique and fascinating
3. The special effects are amazing and don't distract (unlike some Pierce Brosnan Bond movies). They fit into the plot perfectly.4. The acting is very good.But the assemled pieces make the whole only very good, not amazing: The movie is just too big, and they had to edit it to cut it down to essential info and scenes, resulting in a slightly unnatural flow that feels like trying to drink from a fire hose shoved in your mouth. A mild, subtle infodump feeling arises at times. There are no natural lulls or pauses to digest info. The first time watching you will feel absolutely lost for the first 45 minutes or so unless you read spoilers first, due to a combination of that flow and some out of sequence story telling. The 2nd time watching will be much more enjoyable than the first... it is that lesser enjoyment the first time through that keeps it from being amazing, knocking it down to just very good. There are two main storylines, one mostly in the present, the other about the main character's past...found myself wondering if the latter could have been less prominent or even cut to focus more on the former.","

The concept is very interesting, but there are so many loopholes and unanswered questions and illogical contrivances that we both just shook our heads and enjoyed the scenery. I have to wonder where all of the high ratings for this flick are coming from. I am not buying that as many people loved this thing on the same par as Lord of the Rings and Godfather.

My young teen son was raving about it and forced me to go to it, he was very happy that I was there the 2nd time as I was able to wake him up from the total brainwashing of modern movie making Hollywood style. First of all take a very lousy infantile script and dress it up with all kinds of jargon about dreams and subconscious but in fact the story makes no sense at all and has a crude central storyline that is ridiculous - a teenager could make it up. Next take a good smattering of Hollywood A list actors to make it look slick. Get a fantastic stunt crew and great special effects team to make this silly stupid storyline look amazing and keep a bunch of immature easily duped people in their seats for two hours thinking they are watching ground breaking cinema but in fact are watching a story that does not have any substance and a plot that is fit for a 14 year old. Meanwhile the 14 year old mindset believes in the illusion of the picture and gets 'hooked in' with the violence and the extra wow factor of Hollywood over the top visual blackmail.

"hnt_dnl","31 May 2011","Acclaimed director Christopher Nolan scores with the general movie-going audience once again with his highly anticipated film INCEPTION (2010). The hook for this film is it's exploration into the concept and idea of ""dreams"". Frankly, my immediate response when I saw this film was that the it's definition of dreams seems to be more based on NOLAN's interpretation and not the general consensus! Some of it sounded correct, while some of it sounded like mumbo jumbo! At the same time, Nolan essentially executes the dream aspects of the movie within his own set of rules and more or less does not violate them, which is actually part of the problem. In the big picture, I don't think dreams work the way this movie portrays them.INCEPTION stars Leonardo DiCaprio as dream expert extractor Cobb. DiCaprio gives a passable performance, but it's not anything mesmerizing or Oscar-caliber. Frankly, I think that this actor is probably the most overrated major star of the last decade. It's partially that he's a victim of his eternal youthful look, so it makes it hard to take him seriously in these ""adult"" roles; I feel like he's being forced upon me as a star, rather than truly being one! Unlike when he was a teen actor in the early to mid 90s, I don't find him very engaging as an adult actor. He simply doesn't draw me in. And, actually, in this movie, I was more engaged by the other ensemble's performances more than his. He felt like a 5th wheel, especially since it was his character that was actually an impediment to the mission succeeding.The real acting standouts in the film for me were Cillian Murphy and former Best Actress Oscar winner Marion Cotillard. Murphy plays the team's target Robert Fischer, whose billionaire industrialist father had recently died, so Cobb's team was on an assignment, paid by Fischer's main competitor Saito (a solid Ken Watanabe) to implant an idea in his mind to liquidate his father's empire. Murphy did a much better job showing depth and character detail than DiCaprio, whose tale was actually more tragic, with his dreams haunted by the memory of his late wife Mal (hauntingly played by Cotillard, and I actually didn't realize it was her until the end credits rolled!). The capable supporting cast playing Cobb's ""dream team"" is led by up and coming star Ellen Page (as Ariadne, a specialist in architecture, who constructs the dream landscape for the film's big mission). Although she was underused mainly as a fascinated observer and Cobb's support, I found Page to be very engaging. After constructing the dream landscape, Ariadne's assignment was to protect Cobb from his demonic subconscious in the form of his late wife Mal. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fine also as Arthur, Cobb's sidekick who monitors the dreamers to ensure that they eventually get ""kicked"" (treated rather flimsily in this movie!) out of them. Tom Hardy is also good as Eames, a forger whose expertise is needed in the dreams to shapeshift his appearance to the dreamer. Dileep Rao soundly functions as chemist Yusef, creator of the drug that will allow the team to go into 3 levels of dream states in order to execute the mission.Where INCEPTION actually drew me in was in the last half, with it's steamrolling action sequences as the dreamers went from level to level, which I did not expect at all! I thought this was going to be some kind of mind-bending, trippy exercise, which it really wasn't. The way the movie portrays dreaming is actually very pat and linear, and the miniscule complexity is what allows the viewer to follow and be more engaged in the action. That is, while not completely mindless (pardon the pun!), the dream state stuff is pretty easy to follow. Also, Nolan did a good job of defining how the different levels work in the film's opening sequence.My biggest complaint about the film is it's rather simplistic way of describing dreams, and this ties in with the DiCaprio character Cobb, who was the biggest detriment to the mission because of his subconscious drawing his wife Mal into the dreams at inopportune moments. Other than the dreamer himself, why weren't any of the other teams subconscious in the dreams coming into play? Basically, Cobb was the only team member whose subconscious posed a wild card threat, which is hard to believe. If you take Cobb out of the equation, the mission runs a lot smoother than it actually did. Cobb is the only reason for a true threat to exist and for there to be any suspense, and after a while, I found the Cobb-Mal stuff to be more of a distraction than an important plot point. Minus Cobb, the movie is really just a simple action flick with no true threats in the dreams other than the main dreamer's typical subconscious threats, which were basically a bunch of useless gun-toting brutes who couldn't hit the side of a barn! Again, it was all very entertaining, but definitely not groundbreaking.INCEPTION was nominated for Best Picture, in part I think due to the fact that there are 10 nominations now. Chances are it would not have been nominated if there were only still 5 since Nolan himself didn't garner a Best Director nomination. Enteraining experience, but definitely not Oscar-worthy.","

"mcw2112","4 January 2011","First off, it's clear that these IMDb ratings are no longer valid. This film was just 'ok' by anyone's standards, except maybe the plethora of teenagers that love anything that includes lots of gun fire and 'splosions. The plot was unnecessarily convoluted and chock full of lazy writing. I have really liked Chris Nolan's work, so this is not a personal attack on him; it's just nowhere near as slick as others have claimed. The biggest symptoms of lazy writing are: constant exposition in the guise of conversation, constant changing of rules set up earlier in the movie and supposedly brilliant people making illogical choices, when the plot demands it. Many have said that those of us who didn't like it were just clueless and didn't ""get it"". What's to get? The plot was not difficult to understand, just difficult to accept as anything that made any sense. A dream with a dream within a dream. Big effing deal! I bought this film on DVD and couldn't wait to see it as so many people had hailed it as the best thing since Citizen Kane. I was left feeling empty and ripped off, then again, there is an entire generation that claims ""Transformers"" and ""Independence Day"" are two of the best films ever made. I fail to understand how this over-blown, over-hyped film could garner such high ratings unless the people doing the rating have never seen a movie over 20 ears old. The concept was high-minded but the execution was pure popcorn-munching tripe. While I'll admit the cinematography was gorgeous and the acting was fairly well done, it was just so empty. As others have pointed out, when it's all just a dream, there's not a lot of tension when faceless people are shooting at you. Just plain silly, I say. (as an aside, South Park did a very funny dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream years ago!)","

"blackmambamark","13 July 2010","Only a small handful of directors have the ability to make an audience wait on pins and needles for their next NON sequel release. For me, i cannot remember the last time i was this excited for a movie i know virtually nothing about. Now i know i may be speaking on my own here, but director Christopher Nolan very well may be the best director of our generation. Because the guy has not missed so far. ""Memento"", ""The Prestige"", The Batman Series......the guy is a loose cannon who fires nothing but cinematic gold. As time goes on, he only seems to get better and better. Hopefully he can continue the re-occurring trend.Okay, let me get this off my chest, because it feels like an alien ready to burst out of my chest........this is easily one of the 10 best movies i have ever seen in my entire life. And that is not because i built this up in my mind or bought into the hype generated around this film, because everything i thought this movie was going to be, fell short of what it actually was about 20 minutes into it. This movie is cinematic genius at it's best, plain and simple. We have been due for a movie like this for a loooonnngggg time. And i don't mean this year, or the recent string of poor movies that have been released......i mean we are due for a movie that actually changes the way we look at movies. Now i know one would be quick to say ""Well wait a minute, Avatar already did that."". But that is where you would be wrong. James Cameron gave us a feast with ""Avatar"". This movie cooks you an entire Thanksgiving dinner.I could honestly sit here and try as hard as i could to try and describe the movie to you, and it wouldn't make a lick of sense because the movie is beyond in-depth. Case in point.....you remember the first time you saw the first ""Matrix"", and how complex and deep the plot was. Well, in words, this movie makes that idea look like ""Kindergarden Cop"". No disrespect to ""The Matrix"" at all, but this movie is probably the most in-depth, detailed, complex, and entertaining movie ever created by man.And that's all Nolan seems to do. He creates these scripts that almost take a life of their own. You get a glimpse of it in ""Memento"", and you certainly see it in action with ""The Prestige""......how the actual plot outline and story, is the actual trick. In this movie, it deals with mazes, and in turn, the whole movie is like a giant maze that you try and figure out.But that's where Nolan's true genius comes in. Through out the entire picture, he gives you these little clues as to whats going on, like a puzzle, and he shows you how they all get put together, rather than putting it together for you. He leaves it up to the audience to do so. And that's what makes this movie great, because he challenges the audience like no other movie i have ever seen.And speaking of things i have never seen. In order for a movie written this well to work, it must be shot in the same fashion. And Nolan, once again, out does himself. If you are a fan of cinematography, as i am as well, then this movie, literally, is your wet dream. Talking about these elaborate dream sequences is one thing, but seeing them in action is beyond anything you have ever seen on the silver screen. Throughout the entire film, i kept taking a napkin to my face to wipe the clumps of drool that were collecting at the bottom of my jaw.Bottom Line, this is a movie i could write a novel about, and it certainly deserves that attention. To pretty much sum it up, if you want to see the movie that is going to win best picture of the year, go and see this movie. If you want to see one of the best movies in the past 10 years, go and see this movie. If you want to see a movie that will pretty much change your method of thinking, then go and see this movie. God only knows how many movies i have seen in my lifetime, but i can say with complete just, that this is certainly one of the 10 best i have EVER seen.","

"supah79","4 August 2010","Don't get me wrong, Christopher Nolan (writer, producer and director of this movie) is a very, very talented filmmaker. He will undoubtedly make that masterpiece for which he will be remembered. But that's just my point: he hasn't made it yet. The Dark Knight wasn't it and Inception certainly isn't it. Inception is a product of a director who has been given carte blanche. His vision has been put on film without someone ever saying: 'Chris, that's not going to work.' For that matter, Inception should have been Nolan's Heaven's Gate. But Inception will probably make Nolan a even bigger star. He better check his totem I felt compelled to write a review when I found out this movie had a 9.2 rating and a 3rd place overall in the top 250. Let me say: that is ridiculous. To balance the scale, I have rated this movie (a ridiculous) 1. I agree with some posts on the message board of IMDb: complex does not mean intellectual or smart. And for that matter, I don't think this film is very complex. It just asks what most movies do: go with it.DiCaprio gives a pretty good performance (with leftovers from his role in Shutter Island) as Dobbs, a person who is able the penetrate someone's dream and see or steal his secrets. Recently Dobbs lost his wife and he has not seen his children in a long time. That is because the authorities think he has something to do with his wife's death. Watanabe gives Dobbs a chance to get his life back. He needs to plant an idea (inception) in the mind of a competitor. Like a seed, it will grow. And the inspiration for the idea will seem real.One of the problems for me with the movie was that the dreamworld felt pretty flat and boring to me. Unlike The Matrix (a inception for this movie), the inhabitants of the other world do not bend the rules of gravity. The laws of physics do apply. That's not a bad decision. But I agree with one reviewer: 'Nolan's dreamworld looks like a mediocre action film from the 90's.' The bad guys walk around like video game characters with an AI set on level Easy. I almost shouted in the theater when Eames went Rambo in the snow scene. I understand the decision. Look at The Cell to see how wrong you can go if you explore the subconscious on film. But still, for me his decision to keep the dreamworld neat and clean is a cop out. Dreams don't look like this. Hopes, fears and experiences mix with (the conception of) the real world and you get a pretty original result sometimes. None of this in Inception. Oh right, the architect is in control. How convenient The whole dream within a dream concept was a little far-fetched for me. Have you ever had one? Probably not. So why, when you have a pretty basic dreamworld go with a concept this unreal? The real world does influence the dream the character's have. But they feel it and are conscious that it is the real world. That's a missed opportunity. A dream influenced by factor's unknown to the dreamer could have made it much more enjoyable for the audience.Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. Like Nolan's former projects The Prestige and The Dark Knight: I don't get all the hoopla. Yes, these movies (like Inception) are well made. They are original, have refreshing ideas, are technically good and have decent scripts. But they are not the best of the decade. And this one really is not a 9.2. I'd say a 5.5. Barely...","

"HaddonfieldJason","7 January 2011","Wow what have we here? What hast thou put before our eyes? Could it be Christopher Nolan's boorish tripe 'Inception'? I myself could not tell as the movie was far too low brow to make even the slightest impression on my vastly superior intelligence. Nolan is an amateur who makes movies based on blatantly foreseeable childish artifices that only the most unintelligent boors would find the least bit amusing. 'Inception' is the kind of film designed to make lamebrains feel like they are intelligent. Nolan's intellectualism-for-dummies should be the main title of his biography. Luckily I am smart enough to see past this charade and give the people their fair assessment of this tripe.'Inception' is built upon the notion of traveling through dream like spaces that bend time, space, and reality, yawn. It's been done before Chris in a much sounder fashion in Charlie Kaufman's epic masterpiece 'Synecdoche, New York'. That film is an orgasmic experience while 'Inception' is just beyond words describing it. I mean you might conclude that the inner subconscious would be more creative in coming up with better metaphors for security than guys with guns who chase you. The lengthy exposition- oh I mean training montage, despite having a semi-acceptable computer effect, was way more boring and less engaging than the scene it stole from 'The Matrix', and at least that scene didn't have Nolan's pretentiousness. Larry the Cable Guy is less insulting to the intellect. I mean Sarah Palin sounds smarter than Christopher Nolan's dialogue. ( Conjointly, the Herculean careener of mesh networks is titled Ariadne? Really? None of the juveniles that give you your millions will get that reference Chris but I'm glad you know how to use wikipedia)","

"kenjha","12 February 2011","Nolan has made some of the dreariest films in recent memory, but this incomprehensible nonsense takes the cake. While keeping a straight face, actors deliver lines such as ""dreams within dreams is too unstable"" and ""if we get killed we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn into scrambled egg."" DiCaprio and company supply the ham. This movie tells us that ten hours of real time is equivalent to one week of dream time. That explains why this nightmare of a movie feels like it goes on for two days despite the running time of two and a half hours. And if one falls asleep while watching, the only way to resume one's normal life is to limbo under a totem pole.","

"doorsscorpywag","1 November 2010","I must admit I was really looking forward to this film but as with most of the big blockbusters in recent years it was a rather overrated experience. A good cast and some good acting but an overly complicated script and convoluted way of going about stuff using ideas from a lot of decent films that have gone before. The argument that if you don't like it you are too dumb to understand it does not wash as it's easy enough to understand what's going on but why it's going on does not make that much sense. One example is that for no sensible reason Leo is involved in a domestic situation that results in his wife's death and now seems to be worldwide public enemy number one?We have the usual assembling of an elite team to go in and carry out the usual impossible mission with consequences that are unknown to most of the team members that will impact on their success or not. Well that's original.Chucking sci-fi babble into a story does not always enhance the story and most of the inception idea tech talk is boring and nonsensical.The 'shock' ending is predictable and has been signposted since pretty much the start of the film which was overlong and overcomplicated and not at all as intelligent as it was made out to be. Like Shutter Island Leo is once again involved in a film that promises a lot but delivers not a great deal. Some spectacular sets and nice effects cannot cover up an ordinary fun bit of sci-fi nonsense passed off as genius. Like Avatar before it thinking it is some kind of genre changing piece of film when its just a half decent bit of entertainment that will linger with an audience until they get to the car park of KFC.Thought provoking cinema seems destined to be left behind for this kind of multi layered pseudo sci-fi babble which looks pretty but is not as clever as it likes to think.","

"tedg","19 July 2010","When I watch a movie, all sorts of machinery kicks in. I am aware of only some of that, and can massage and train only a bit of that — of what I see of myself.This machinery is based on layers, folding, recursion. It is just how the mind works, this business of seeing self. Some art — I would argue all — fits into this equation in some way: surfing, deflating, revealing some part of the flow. The most exciting to me are those that expose the machinery itself, the folding dynamics. Oh, I have no illusion that this or any simple equation is ""the answer,"" but it seems that we do live in movies, our life is the movie we make. If we want valuable art, it will be art that reminds us of that fact: a movie that is powerful enough to let us know the limits of its power.Nolan will get credit for making an entertaining artifact. The intelligence — no simply the complexity — of the story makes us invest. It is why folding works with the marketplace: it increases the entanglement we make with the story. Then Nolan can drag in cinematic effects that otherwise would be ordinary: bombs, gunfights, carchases... and we see them as extraordinary because of the perceptive entanglement.This works as well for our relationship with the actor. in interviews, Leonardo is talking openly about what first level actors know: that you deliver the character, but you also deliver a folded presentation having to do with the knowledge the actor and viewer share about the whole process. How does one play a character that is a character within? How do you project an awareness of withinness?As with ""Following"" and ""Memento,"" it isn't just about the layers; it is about how they affect one another and how they include the folds of the presentation as a film, and as we live.I would like to remark on only one aspect of how Nolan put this together: space. We have all sorts of life values represented here. We have the noir detective, the pilgrimage to family, the deceiver, the drivers... all with designated characters. In there we have the architect. She is the fourth that we know. The first is the father, played by Michael Caine. He is a master professor of some stripe — we don't really know. What we do know is Caine's face, one of the most familiar in film. Nolan knows him as Bruce Wayne's caretaker, the keeper of the enabling space for Batman (including the space carried in the costume-cape).His son, Leonardo's character, has taken his dad's empire of the mind and broken it down for use in layers. The other father here is a surrogate for Cobb's. Cobb is presumed to be the master architect, but is hampered, so he has to seek others. One we see briefly at the beginning, someone who fails. The one of interest to us is recommended by the Dad as superior to Cobb. Enter Ariadne, the goddess of the labyrinth, what in the business is called a four, a reality savant.She is the designer and guide of everything we see, everything. She is the magi, the creator; everything we see is something she made, even the illusion Cobb, has that in an inner dream he made something and lived in it for decades. Even, even the possible illusion that he returns. Even the more ambiguous architecture of lives that Cobb believes he experienced — a lifetime with his wife.There is one scene where this is not so — where the world is not Ariadne's, and for me it is the key scene. I hold it as the anchor around which I build everything.Our actual romance (Cobb and Ariadne) are in their first shared space— her first dream experience. This is Cobb's dream, his architecture. They are sitting outside by a Paris cafe, one of filmdoms most seductive places. (It seems to quote ""Irma la Douce"" in more ways than one, but certainly in the set.) He is seducing her into helping him build an inner world — risky, more engaging than anything can be. It is for the purpose of regaining his children (as he settles with his father) and incidentally saving the world from energy tyranny. He is grizzled, worn out from past wars of the mind. He has just suffered a defeat because of an inadequate architect. He is at the end of his life; this will be his last job. She is at the beginning of hers. Her face is fresh, her self open, her mind powerful but innocent. He explains that everything she sees is created by him. He then proceeds to create what has to be the best use of cinematic space I know; the environment deconstructs. It doesn't explode so much as is ceases to become boundaries of space and becomes space itself, dense, breathable. It is the most powerful, erotic thing I have experienced on screen; his space penetrates her skin to the core. When they awake, he knows he has her — forever.My believe is that Nolan opened the possibility that Moll was something he and she co- created as part of the labyrinth we go through with them, noir-wise. It is all about the fall, the connection among layers, the penetration into the soul. Nolan drapes a thriller around this, almost as a joke. But this is about seduction, spatial seduction. I imagine Chris with Emma. The question here is where is the idea planted and by whom. You may be fooled.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.","

"mancuniangr","30 October 2011","Inception rated 12 of all films,above for instance of ALL OF HITCHCOCK'S FILMS.The problem and it isn't about rating movies only ,but let's say ,discussing who is the best footballer of all time ,or which is the best musician etc,IS that young people ,who are the majority of those who are familiar to the internet and go and write reviews ,haven't seen great people in their lifetime and can't comprehend what their real value was.It's different to listen from other people about Pele or Maradona than actually watch them ,when they were in their prime.It's different to listen from other people about the Beatles ,than actually understand what was going on, when they performed in the 60's.So OK,i won't be surprised if Justin Bieber on an online survey is higher than the Beatles ,because the teenagers are 70-90% of all internet users.So that leads to unbelievable PERVERSED results,like this above.In 10 years time the DVD version of this ""masterpiece"" might be selling 20-30 copies all over the world(not thousands).I think it's the only film ,that IMDb shouldn't care about spoilers,because you can't spoil a storyline that doesn't exist. Ridiculous ,shockingly bad,laughable but clever(clever in that they succeeded, in taking money from my pocket, for watching it).When i have watched over maybe 5000 films ,i used to gloat that i can smell from kilometers away the ""potatoes""(a phrase that means really really bad films).Not any more.Maybe when i reach 10000 films, i will have the power to save my self from the next Inception.","

"chaos-rampant","2 November 2010","I wonder how many different ways will Nolan find around making a heist movie. Whereas the average heist film basically makes a statement that hits a mark around ""crime doesn't pay"", a Nolan film at some point feels the need to peel back the heist film as an irrelevancy that no longer serves a purpose to give us catharsis and soaring emotional crescendos. Yet he makes his catharsis the same way he makes his heist movie framing devices, mechanical and calculated and 'movie-like'.For all the hoo hah of philosophical ambition about boxes inside boxes, this is still a movie where a plot is set in motion by characters saying things like ""we had to deliver Saito's expansion plans to Cobol Engineering two hours ago"" and where a team is assembled to work for ""some very very powerful people"". In all this furrore the make juvenile mistakes. The heir to the most powerful energy conglomerate in the world apparently flies to Los Angeles not in his personal jet but on an airline owned by his competitor. The movie hinges its believability in abstract stratagems like ""the subject's mind can always trace the genesis of that idea"".Like Shutter Island, I am bothered by this type of film that purports to speak at profound length about dreams and their mechanics, yet seems to understand nothing at all about dream logic. In Shutter Island dreams are tableaux of carefully constructed symbolism, detail planned in all the right spots to mean something. Inception is even less; dreams are vistas/levels of real world abstracted to a small degree. When a van tumbles over a bridge, the people dreaming inside that van find themselves bumping about in their dream! Where Scorsese's movie allowed for itself the failsafe of being able to claim that it's all a pastiche of 50's detective mysteries, Inception is a Nolan film so it must take itself thoroughly serious at every turn.The Nolans are really masters of film structuralism, I can't take that away from them nor do I want to, they excel in this. They are great architects who make boxes carefully fit within other boxes, an elaborate maze to lose the viewer in, but their idea of trascending box and maze is to the force the viewer into submission by sheer volume of plot detail. I like how we're given fragments of images that pay off later but at the same time can't help but feel that, outside the mechanics of it, when it comes to emotional response, those fragments never really challenge our expectations. For more than two hours, Nolan symbolizes Leo's guilt on leaving a family behind by showing him unable to dream/remember the faces of his children, always seeing their backs. In the end he does, yet, again seemingly through that architectural need to create another narrative box, the film ends on the ambiguous note ""is this another dream?"" that betrays the emotional response of the character seeing his children's faces.What annoys me most about this is two things though. That the movie seems content to give the impression that a villain, like a Minotaur in the far end of a labyrinth, inhabits the lowest level of the dream, closed in a hotel room of broken furniture, or a bleak cityscape of concrete buildings without features, and even characters who should know better refer to it in the third person like it actually exists down there as something more than a figment of Leo's subconscious.And more importantly, that Nolan creates a very elaborate system of dreams within dreams and simultaneous narratives that hinge on the idea that dream time is condensed (I find this fascinating, that entire lives can be played out in the span of time it takes a van to tumble over a bridge), yet he only fills those boxes with the most banal and unimaginative action set pieces. Dream levels are in turns hazy aimless blurs of something that is very gray and very rainy, of characters running around in orangecolored corridors, of characters running around in the snow shooting guns at each other.I'm not sure that Nolan could make a better movie even if he didn't have blockbuster expectations to fulfill or financial investments to protect, even with the ridiculous actions trimmed out, a dream version of Memento would not warrant Kubrick comparisons. For a generation that wasn't old enough to take the red pill ten years ago this should serve as a Matrix for the new decade, but when it comes to meaningfully capturing what it feels like to dream no one has yet to even rival Lynch.","

But I watched it and tried to follow it as closely as possible.But the film is way too long, overdone, too complicated and too messy. It is also too literal. Dreams are messy, choppy, chaotic and blurry. For some reason, dreams for this crew are pretty neat and orderly. Sure things seem distorted at times but not in a dream-like manor.And then the films starts to fall into the Hollywood formula with chases, people shooting, people getting shot, blah, blah, blah.I frankly became bored with the entire thing and was glad when it was over.

"TheLittleSongbird","5 March 2011","I heard a number of great things about Inception, including from my sister who came out saying it was one of the cleverest and best movies she'd seen. After seeing it for myself, I thought it was a good film, but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen, Inception didn't wow me as much as Memento and The Prestige, and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that mean the film is bad? No, I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan's best as I have heard people say.My main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment, I do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold. Particularly in the characters, they are written and acted well, but not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments. I loved the idea of the story, it was clever and somewhat original and it did start very compelling and intriguing, but as the film progresses it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little interest. Also, the pace is uneven, as the characters became more cold and the story more convoluted, the film really does start to drag until the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.Inception despite these faults does have a number of strengths, especially the beautifully crafted production values, dream sequences and effects and Nolan's superb direction. Hans Zimmer's score is incredibly good too, while powerful and haunting it rarely becomes overbearing, while the dialogue is on the whole clever and thought-provoking. The acting is generally very good, both Leonardo DiCaprio, with a more hardened persona which has grown even more, and Ellen Page give strong performances and while Marion Cotillard is underused she is pretty good as well and Cillian Murphy I think gives the best supporting performance as he is superb.Overall, Inception is a generally good film but not as good as it is lauded to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox","

This is one of those movies that hooks you from beginning to end!The plot is engaging and you never know what to expect as the movie builds up and becomes more and more intense and thrilling! This is also a journey of guilt, confronting yourselves and learning to move on! Directing is amazing with some truelly iconic scenes such as the hallway fight which is expertly made and filmed!

"buckikris","12 August 2012","I can't believe I wasted 6 dollars to see this movie at the theater. It was a waste of 2 hours and 20 minutes. I don't know why this movie got so much praise, it's a pointless sci-fi movie that should have gone straight to video. I see some reviews say this movie was better than Star Wars, you have got to be kidding. Unlike Inception Star Wars had a great story, the actors even though unknown at the time impressed me; and the special effects-WOW. I must say Star Wars blows Inception out of the water still to this day. To anyone who doesn't think so must be too young to know that it took a lot more effort in the 70's to make a great film. I was really disappointed in Inception, I thought since Nolan did The Dark Knight movies this would be another success. This movie was slow, boring and really had no plot. The only thing I took from it was it was a dreams and getting into peoples heads in there most vulnerable time while they are dreaming. The ending was a WTF ending the kind that can make or break movies, but since this on was broken from the start the ending really didn't surprise me. To all who want to see a great sci-fi movie pick up the classic, like Alein, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Equilibrium, ETC.. I know from watching these movies and being a big fan of the SW saga, you won't be disappointed. Hey BTW, looking for a great TV Mini-series blockbuster from the 80's checkout V and V-The Final Battle, these movies are classics and I would recommend them to anyone who likes a great sci-fi movie.THX, Kris L.

"maddog-50","5 December 2011","But not for me. The movie unmasks itself as a very uninspired convoluted pseudo something when the protagonists have to find an alternative dream-tactic because their target protects himself. What they consider to be a new psychological trick is so plain and unoriginal that becomes clear with a 'kick' that Nolan was absolutely unaware of any scientific profound background by developing the plot. The plot within a plot within a plot is not automatically an ""intellectual"" challenging procedure when one plot is the exact mirror of the other. The challenge for me was to stay awake whilst the plot stumbles from one hole to the next:How do they get connected so that can dream the same dream? Chemically, physically?? How can they transport their conscious plans into their unconscious dreams and execute them there? Etc., Etc.I can't help it, but Nolan is one of the few directors in Hollywood who can direct any script as tedious as you can imagine. There are so many moments in that movie where i thought Wow, that could have been much more suspenseful if, for instance, Cameron or so had directed it.This movie is stupid. You can make a stupid plot 'intelligent' by nesting it multiple times, it just multiplies its stupidity. In this sense the next Nolan movie could be a even greater ""masterpiece"" for meat heads: when it has a dump base plot every fool can follow, but this time the plot is the plot in the plot in the plot in the plot in the.....that's challenging isn't it?","

"CihanVercan","9 August 2010","~MY REVIEW CONTAINS SEVERAL REFERENCES TO TARKOVSKY, A QUOTATION FROM ROGER EBERT AND ANOTHER FROM CHRISTOPHER NOLAN'S INCEPTION SCRIPT (for detailed info check below the end of this article)~ Ideas need to be enriched while the roots are kept loyal, especially in Sci-Fi. Above everything else, aware of the fact that while the story is taking place in several dimensions of dreams, there is no link to the real-life. My first point is about this huge story development deficiency. The only link to our universal earth dimension is Michael Caine character and the children, and they're frozen, they're playing out there in the garden, we see from behind. This is the first thing why the whole movie is para-psychologically inappropriate. I said para-psychologically inappropriate, 'cos today psychology is in the point that dreams expose supernatural(or meta-physical) skills of human mind. If you are implanting an idea through a dream into someone's mind, it's not that easy, THE BALANCE OF NATURE WOULDN'T EASILY LET YOU DO THAT. As an example I want to compare the Inception with ""The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind"". There, Jim Carrey was going back time in his dream trying to identify the person who is dating with his fiancée; but he ends up with facing a supernatural vitality covering the person's face. The way Nolan explains is this: *(1)* ""Never recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places."" When the time comes where Saito explains why he hired Cobb for the implantation, this is all we get: *(2)* ""You remind me of someone... a man I met in a half-remembered dream. He was possessed of some radical notions"" So the most important question one ever needs to ask ""How did they all start to dream implantation?"". There is no answer nor explanation to it. Whereas in its ancestor, ""The Minority Report"" was quite brilliant at explaining the technological advance. Compare with Matrix, the dreams are your guides to the reality, you're not a guide to someone's dream. Matrix gives you a clue of understanding how some people's lives may change with their dreams and visions. It had this inspiration that Neo became a hero out of a loser. Dreams are able to do that, as Wachowski Brothers taught us. Another comparison can be done with the good and evil side. Nolan never divides people into good vs. evil as Batman or as Memento or any films he's done. But for someone's favor, Cobb is hired by business man to implant an idea into another business man, which doesn't do any thing with the good. *(3)* ""The only condition of fighting for the right to create is faith in your own vocation, readiness to serve, and refusal to compromise"" Sci-Fi loves impossible, but it also denies the practical errors. Inception's plot is theoretically fine but practically slow off the mark. Just like Roger Ebert said at Chicago Sun, Inception's story can either be told in a few sentences or not told at all. Ebert's approach to criticize Nolan's earlier work was even more harsh. *(4)* ""How does a man with short-term memory loss, remember he has short-term memory loss?"" (for Memento). Some injuries can go engraved someone's sub-conscious, so he didn't even need to remember it, he was just living it. Though Ebert was right on one thing, that if Ellen Page hasn't been enrolled in the movie as a new chosen one to this confidential job, the whole movie was almost meaning nonsense. The things that are likable is Marion Cotillard participating as a independent virus in dreams, going in and killing whoever and whenever she likes. Ellen Page is being used to create spaces in dreams, so that the missionaries will be able to create totems that tell a person whether they're dreaming or living the reality. The only totem without Ellen Page was the spinning of the whipping top in the sleep house. Also the last dream which Di Caprio is having on the airplane was cut in the half as if it was meant for to be continued. It was the only dream that made me believe that someone is dreaming, whether it's Cobb or Arthur or any of the missionaries. 'CAUSE DREAMS NEVER LAST. *(1)*(2)*: from Quotes for Inception at IMDb / *(3)* : from Andrei Tarkovsky quotes at thinkexist.com / *(4)* : from Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times, July.14.2010","

"jeroen-106","13 February 2011","Can't believe the high reviews as I think it's the worst Nolan productions to date. Means: it's a good/average movie, but not great.The whole movie is just too stylistic, the romance is cold and uninteresting, the characters are one dimensional, and the whole dream thing is just too stylistic. The movie wants to be too intelligent for its own good. I preferred how dreams where presented in ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind"": blurry, not cohesive stories and unpredictable.Inception used dreamworlds as a cheap way of adding car chases, shoot outs in snow. The whole dream-in-dream thing is nice but doesn't add anything to the story.The romance thingie is just annoying to watch. I just don't care. But I should.Meh.","

"ElMaruecan82","6 January 2011","Regardless of my definitive opinion, this is a 'sensational' film and a mind-bending one like I've never seen before. And guess what ? I think I was victim of its own concept since I went through four stages of reviews with ""Inception"", one within another (naturally) :REVIEW 1 : Ecstasy in Perception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""This is not a film, This is an experience ... a cinematic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ... This is why I love movies ... why imagination is the greatest human gift ... why I dream to write such creative and intelligent stories ... And still ... I don't know how to feel ... Movies like this should be praised and loved ... I loved it, but I feel something messy now in my mind, and that I can't get out ... I need to watch it again ... this is not a movie to watch once ... definitely ... it's so disturbing it's great, so great it's disturbing ..."" 10/10This is the raw feeling, authentic? sincere? naive? well it was the immediate one, one that couldn't be altered by other viewer's opinions, praises or criticisms. This is how I felt when the movie ended. A second watching transported me from ecstasy in perception to ...REVIEW 2 : Originality in Conception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""It's a dazzling intelligence-challenging puzzle, but only on an intellectual level, not emotional. Why not? Should all the movies have a 'heart' beating inside ... as long as it makes yours do. Now I understand the film and love it because I decided not to care for the emotion and just try to understand the story. And with this mindset, believe me, ""Inception"" is an incredible experience. The movie is a fantasy and remains realistic in the same time, it's real because we know it's fake, but the fake world feels so real because we can technically live in. It doesn't say anything about dreams and subconsciousness, because it's all about actual and virtual reality, perceptions and intentions. As a script, it's a very impressive work from Christopher Nolan, not to mention the brilliant editing. Yes, I know I'm watching a film, but this one I value as an intricate puzzle that challenges my intelligence. ""Inception"" is like a cinematic Rubik's cube."" 9,5/10I was still loving the film, but in the meantime, starting to concede that the enjoyment was more on a technical level, on the construction of the plot and the intricacy of the script ... I admitted that the whole Mal-Cobb subplot was just plot devices to insert a melodrama, necessary to plunge us in Cobb's subconscious and inject it into Fisher's dreams, combining this way two parallel worlds, two narrative structures. In such action-driven films, 'forced' is 'flat' and melodrama must be handled carefully. The movie was perceived as excellent by my humble mind, but more in a cinematographic, geometric, almost pragmatic way ... which brings me to ...REVIEW 3 : Enthusiasm in Reception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""It's a great film that should grab the Oscars for Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Visual Effects, Sound Effects, Best Cinematography. If it didn't, there would be no justice!"" 8/10I knew I enjoyed the movie because as I mentioned before, it featured great thrills, action, script, music, editing, visuals ... hence the word 'sensational' I used in the beginning of this review. But as I titled in another review : ""many elements of greatness don't necessarily make a great film"". I started to question myself. It's a film about dreams, about subconscious, right? but did I sense a real escapism in those supposedly dreamy settings? didn't those dreams look a little bit like micro-episodes from formulaic action films? could the fights (or anything for that matter) be more imaginative? did the Mal-Cobb subplot make me feel sympathy for any of them? did I really care for Cobb? or did Leo make me care for his character? did I care for the whole mission? did any of the characters appeal to me? So many interrogation marks leading me to the ""Limbo"" review ...REVIEW 4 : Realism in Deception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""Wow ... this movie has a really strange power, it leaves me ecstatic when it finishes, and then the more I think about it, the more I realize that the very aspect that made me love the film could've been handled in a better way and with a deeper characterization: less chase scenes and shootings, more imagination and by that, I mean more beautiful settings and creative plot devices ... This movie is a cinematic experience that makes you scratch your head and hold your breath, but does it deserve all the praise? I wonder how I fell for this one, but I think it's time to retract myself and admit my judgment mistake. Yes, the movie is a cinematic Rubik's cube, but I guess I forgot how I used to get quickly bored by this game. How did I change my mind ? ... I don't know ... thinking, reading, realizing, sharing views, using this mind ""Inception"" tried to twist ... A very creative film, I wish it will win all the Oscars previously mentioned, but beyond the creativity of the concept ... what did I enjoy? I guess only the concept, the rest was just ... all flash and no substance"" 6/10Yep, the rating also fell through 4 ""layers"" ... what a painful awakening, this movie amazed me so much, I couldn't feel anything negative about it ... and one thing for sure, ""Inception"" has the weirdest power of attraction when you watch it for the first time, that's why I understand its popularity. It's like my mind had already accepted the idea that the movie would be a masterpiece just because it relied on a particularly innovative concept. Or was I just victim of an ""Inception"" called Marketing?","

"sandover","27 August 2010","For someone used to - literally - jack-in-the-box (to joker-in-the-box) films, Nolan is peculiarly, inhumanly humorless. And for people - one hopes - with cinematic experience, as some of us are, he must be the industry's greatest fraud, for his films suffer from a complete innate lack of what filmic composition, rhythm, angle, and framing is: the guy is unable to truly engage the gaze; instead, he tries to compensate this lack with solipsistic gimmicks, cold and badly informed. Ah, so many people rave for the intricacies of the plot and the ingenuity of the creator while what they actually do is congratulate themselves for being clever. Has any of them people read any serious stuff on dreams, on the technology of the brain? Freud, lacanian psychoanalysis? Apparently not. What shows it? Exactly this. Show against tell in this case fails: too much blah blah monopolizes the screen and obfuscates any sense of build-up, suggestion, mood, nightmarish entanglements, or what you will, unless one goes for cardboard intensities. And one may say that ""the Matrix"", as this film is so easily compared to, may be called a film of pseudo- or not philosophical aspirations with cardboard intensities, but, at least the first one had the zest to be Baudrillard for cheerleaders.When Hemingway just beginning went to visit the catalyst called Gertrude Stein and showed her some of his writings, she told him this: Description is not literature. Hemingway, begin allover again, and be concentrated.What she meant by this was too much description is not what makes literature literature. I would transcribe it into too much talking in a film does not make it a filmic experience, which goes us back to show me against tell me, more so for telling being in this case explaining away and exhaustingly pap the actors are oddly embarrassed to pronounce, as if unable to find the proper stance.Relentless subterfuge, said the critic Armond White, is what characterizes this film. I would add that this does not signify cinematic enjoyment, but rather too much sound and fury that struts and frets its hours upon the screen, let alone shaping aesthetic subjects.I was glad to discover that the audience, in the provincial cinema in Crete where I saw it, of college boys and girls booed the family reunion pap in the end, and the supposedly grand question one is left with, as if they recognized the film's serious lack of spin, if you know what I mean.PS Kubrick, you said? That is mistaking a rabbi for a mere technician. Supreme juggling? Juggling is all about transforming mechanics into gusto. This does not happen in the film. Rip offs and then rip offs, is the film's offering: the way the children are filmed is an exact copy paste from Roegg's ""Don't look now,"" and the dream-within-dream expansion of time is a footnote to Antonioni's procedure in ""Blow up,"" to add an example or two. Steal and integrate in what you do what you will, I am perfectly OK with that, however botched your creation is. But if you are informed by a rip-off sensibility, your final creation won't even be Frankenstein's monster, but its stitches.","

"lists-9","18 March 2011","I'll begin by saying that I have an inbuilt prejudice against films that seem to put cleverness or 'intelligence' ahead of entertainment value. Having read a lot about this film, I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but in fact was very disappointed to end up disliking it as much as I did.For me, the film lacked two essential elements of an entertaining movie - a coherent plot and sympathetic characters. The plot didn't really start to make any sense until about halfway through (far too late) and Leonardo di Caprio as the central character, Cobb, was competent but just didn't have the charisma to carry this kind of story. His wife's death was foreshadowed a lot in the early part of the film and I found I just didn't care how or why she died. None of the other characters came across as real people and their connection to Cobb was generally unclear to me. The impression was of good actors (like Tom Hardy) being basically wasted.I almost switched off the film after the first twenty minutes because its chaotic action seemed designed almost to alienate the viewer. It started to make some sense after that, but was still a long way from what a good film should be. The over-reliance on sudden loud noises (way above the level of the dialogue) in the first half was simply irritating.The film also seemed to have trouble obeying its own internal logic. Several reviewers have mentioned that there was no consistency in what is supposed to happen when a dreamer dies during a dream; I was unimpressed by the 'projections' in the dreams apparently having their own personalities and being capable of independent thought, although the script also had them as nothing more than figments of the dreamer's imagination.Yes, the film's settings and special effects were impressive, but that's really not what an evening out (or in) should be about. If the story and characterisations are lacking, then why bother watching at all?","

"nogodnomasters","21 July 2018","If you didn't like the Matrix, you might skip this one. Dicaprio is man who is an expert at entering dreams and extracting information for corporate espionage. He has a problem in that there is a price on his head. He is a wanted man. A Japanese business man wants Dicaprio to enter the mind of a competitor and place an idea in his head to break up his empire. In exchange Dicaprio (Dom Cobb) would be allowed to go home to his family. Cobb first gets an architect (Ellen Page) who can design a complex location, such as a dungeon master creating the stage. He then must assemble a team of people with different skills to navigate through the dream world.The beginning of the movie is a bit confusing as you don't know what is real and what is a dream. However this shortly clears up. Dom Cobb has a lot of issues concerning his past life and dreamworld which jeopardizes the mission. His dead wife keeps showing up to foil his plans and he just hasn't the heart to kill her. The dreamworld works like a narcotic. Once you go into it, reality becomes boring. This movie is more brilliant in its complexity and script than it is in entertainment, but it worked for me.","

"lovemichaeljordan","31 October 2021","Inception is a beautiful and unpredictable masterpiece directed by my favorite director, Christopher Nolan. Inception is an epic, intellectual, and thought-provoking action film with an ensemble cast featuring acknowledged actors such as Oscar-winner Michael Caine and Oscar-nominated Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, and Tom Hardy. The movie was released in 2010 but is still widely talked about to this day.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. This makes him one of the most wanted men in the world of espionage. They call him the idea extractor, but this time he is trying something completely different. He is going to plant an idea in the subconscious of the target, not extracting information.I love the concept of this movie. Dreams are a complex subject that we know very little about. A few years ago, I was introduced to the idea of lucid dreaming, and I practice it from time to time. I have a huge interest in dreams and Inception depicts dreaming like no other movie I have ever seen.The actors give exceptional performances. The most complex and incredibly played character is that of Leonardo DiCaprio. He never turns in a bad performance. I think Inception is an underrated work of his.All characters in this movie fill a purpose and they are great. Some people don't like the fact that Ariadne (Elliot Page) only exists to ask questions. I do not mind this. I think it's a clever and effective way to introduce the audience to the complex concepts and ideas of Inception.One of the biggest critiques Christopher Nolan gets is that his movies lack emotion. I have however never found this to be a problem. I prefer action-driven movies over character-driven movies. I believe that a rather cold main character works perfectly fine in a movie like Inception. I watch Inception because I love the plot and the action. I watch Inception because I want to experience something else. Something truly epic. I don't watch inception to cry.I would also argue that Inception is not quite as emotionless as some people say. The movie has got enough heart to make the viewer sympathize with the characters and that is enough in my opinion. Inception is however a big improvement in this department. Tom Hardy's character is a great addition to this movie. The film becomes significantly more playful and doesn't take itself quite as seriously as Nolan's earlier work, without taking away from its weight.There are many reasons why I love Christopher Nolan. His movies are always thought-provoking and sometimes hard to understand, but still very interesting. His movies are almost better on a second viewing because there is always something new to discover.I am not the biggest fan of sci-fi movies, but Inception is an exception (exception not inception LOL). Despite some concepts being very surrealistic, Inception is still grounded. I think the practical effects, sets, and stunts play a big part in this. Christopher Nolan likes to use as little computer-generated imagery as humanly possible. Everything you see in Inception is real. That's what separates Inception and Nolan's other work from many other science-fiction films.Not only do practical effects look more real, but it helps the actors to give better performances. It's way harder to act in front of a green screen than to act in a spinning hallway. It also makes the movie timeless. Computer-generated imagery is improved every year and does not age quite as well as a great practical effect.Hans Zimmer is without a doubt one of the greatest composers of all time. ""Time"" is one of the greatest pieces of music ever created for a motion picture. The score conveys an epic and adventurous atmosphere. The music elevates the suspense and makes the movie twice as good.One aspect which I like about the movie is the way it flows. The pacing is great, and I was always entertained. Nolan likes to use the practice known as ""in media res"" (or as a friend of mine likes to call it: Pulp Fiction). It's used as a literary term to describe when a story opens with the character already in the middle of things - whether it be a high-speed car chase, or a man being washed up on the beach. This narrative technique is a great way to capture the audience's attention. As DiCaprio's character explains in the movie, dreams always start amid things. This movie uses this practice very well. We always skip the non-important and boring stuff and get straight to the action. Everything is still explained and well set up, but we skip the boring stuff which we do not need.The opening sequence is breathtaking. It features some great stunts and action and it's truly mind-boggling. It was love at first sight. It captures the attention of the viewer and sets the bar high for the rest of the film. A lot of concepts are introduced in this sequence, and it is very well done. Also, I love the song ""Dream is collapsing"".Inception is a beautiful movie. The cinematography and the special and visual effects are great. I think miniatures are a great tool to use in moviemaking. Miniatures have this reality that digital effects haven't gotten to yet. It's incredibly hard using CG to recreate complicated actions like explosions and falling buildings. A great example of the use of miniatures is the explosion of the James Bond-like base in the snowy mountains.Some people argue that Nolan doesn't know how to choreograph a great hand-to-hand combat scene. I understand this argument, but I do not believe this applies to Inception. There are few hand-to-hand combat scenes in this movie and one of which is executed perfectly. The hallway scene with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Nolan's fight scenes sometimes lack innovative fight choreography, but they succeed in other aspects. Nolan would rather have the audience remember the significance and meaning of the fight, rather than the fight itself. I think that the fight choreography itself isn't great in the hallway scene, but it doesn't take away from the scene. Other crazy things are happening.The movie is regarded for its praiseworthy editing, even though it wasn't even nominated for the Best Film Editing award in the Academy Awards 2010. The biggest task was to portray the complexity of dreams within dreams, but it was done elegantly. Inception uses a lot of parallel editing, cutting from high-speed chases to slow-motion sequences. If it weren't for the editor, the film would have come out as a complete mess. The movie flows and it's edited in a way to always keep the audience on their toes.Many people find this movie very complex and sometimes hard to understand but I love it. I love to be challenged by a film. The ending of Inception is iconic and remains one of the best movie endings of all time. DiCaprio's character (A. K. A Cobb) spins his totem but then he sees his children. He doesn't wait for the totem to stop spinning, he walks over to his children and Inception cuts away before the audience discovers the truth.The ending has been discussed every year since the release of the movie. Cobb doesn't care whether he is dreaming or awake. Throughout Inception, Nolan presents two very different planes of existence: the real world and the dream world. The final scene is intended to blur those lines - Cobb's reality is whatever he chooses. This begs the question: does it matter which reality he chooses to live in? It's a question I find very intriguing and interesting.There are other hidden meanings in Inception. For inception to work, the subject must believe that the idea is his/her own. Inception is something we experience daily by the news, the internet, and television. We are constantly fed with opinions and ideas and sometimes they stick. I'm not educated enough to talk further about this subject, but it's just food for thought.My review doesn't do this movie justice. This movie is ineffable. Inception was the film that made me fall in love with cinema. I have tried hard to explain how great I think this movie is but there is still so much more to be said. Inception is too great to be expressed in words. Inception is a movie not to be missed. It's a masterpiece worth every second of your time. I was blown away the first time I watched it. I could never take my eyes off it and when the credits rolled, my jaw dropped, and I could do nothing but stand up and applaud. My mind was blown away.","

"CineCritic2517","7 January 2011","I don't know what it is about this movie that people get so carried away with. I guess being under 20 helps, although I talked to some younger friends who thought the movie to be just as insipid, lame and boring as I did.I read that people find this movie's complexity to be one of its strong points. This is quite sad since it's about as complex as the basis of your average video game. I guess that same thing has set the standard to determine what is complex today in films and what is not. Complexity in my book has something to do with multiple layers, each with its own intrinsic appreciation, and is recognized rather easily. The effect namely being that when you miss a significant part of the story, like when watching a good detective, you no longer understand what is going on. I must have at least dozed off 3 times during Inception but wasn't even remotely challenged to work something out that wasn't already all too clear about 15 or 20 minutes in.The characters were unlikable and uninteresting across the board and the same rather goes for the whole of what the movie considers to be its plot. A James Bond type of story arc which doesn't really make the viewer care for it's outcome since such is already pretty clear because Nolan uses the same frigging formula. We got the secret agent, a pretty damsel, a world threat and a plethora of nameless villains with guns, some even on skimobiles! At any given point during ThaT particular scene, I expected a venerable Roger Moore to rush out from behind a snow covered spruce, cunningly herding his chasers into a trap of what appears to be 007's stretchable tie conjoined to and in between two trees.Inception is nothing more than the next action/chase time-waster laced with the compulsory CGI and endless fake-explanatory dialog as if it was breaking down a match between two chess masters. I found it all way too silly and turned it off 15 minutes before the credits rolled. Another cell phone company commercial stretched into feature film length with some big names attached for a complementary audience who can't tell, and couldn't care less to be able to tell, shït from Shinola. 5/10 for the otherwise competent direction, editing and sublime sound editing.","

"jamesfoley-45668","4 December 2021","That fact this movie has an 8.8
Rating shows people's desire to be perceived as being intelligent. This movie is unnecessarily complicated for the sake of being complicated. The story telling is terrible. If a character in a story has to tell the audience directly what the hell is going on the story sucks. A lot of Christopher Nolan's stuff is like this. Whenever someone hears criticism of Inception the first line of attack is ""you just didn't understand it"". I understood it, just didn't like the way it was presented.Having said that Christopher Nolan has a lot of original ideas and some of his stuff is good. He is still one of the only director's today that uses practical effects. The hallway rotating scene with Joseph Gordon Levitt was a practical effect and was amazing. Scenes like that was the only reason I rated Inception a 5/10.","

"TheAnimalMother","19 January 2013","Well, I didn't think it lived up to all the hype, but nonetheless it was still a pretty good film. I don't think the story came out quite the way Nolan had hoped, after working on it for over a decade. In my view the story is basically a combination of Vanilla Sky meets The Matrix, but really it ends up being less meaningful than both (A combination of the mystical waking dream and the matrix of consciousness). This is Nolan's version of Edgar Allan Poe's A Dream Within A Dream, or the like. However I don't think the film really comes across this way as well as it should, or especially, the way it was meant to.Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem that my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown away in a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! Can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! Can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream? The film overall feels forced and clunky, it lacks any kind of good rhythm. For me to see this film ranked in the top 15 films ever made according to the IMDb voters only goes to prove one thing; The IMDb top 250 list is good for nothing at all but a laugh. I thought Inception was pretty good. However pretty good is stretching it as far as I would ever go. This film is a long long way from great.7/10","

"pseawrig","10 September 2011","Okay, maybe this movie isn't awful. It's closer to mediocre, but I just can't resist the urge to lower its over-inflated rating.To be fair, Inception has a strong cast, inventive CGI, and an interesting premise. Nonetheless, the film ends up being surprisingly tedious and unaffecting. Images rush across the screen as jargon-rich dialogue whisks pasts your ears. The film's methodical score swells and swells until you can barely make out what the characters are saying. It's all so complex, but complex like a brainteaser or a riddle. If you concentrate very hard, you can decode the film's narrative trick of dreams within dreams within dreams within, well you get the idea, and multiple action sequences all taking place at once in parallel dreamscapes.But, what do you get for all of your narrative attention? Very little. The story is gimmicky and the characters are flat: you just don't care what happens to them. In fact, when watching this film, I did not feel as if I were watching characters navigate a story world. Instead, I felt like I was watching movie stars speak difficult dialogue while performing stunts.By the way, any movie that can make Joseph Gordon-Levitt seem less than fascinating must have something wrong with it. If you do not believe me, then watch Manic, Mysterious Skin, or The Lookout. Then marvel at Inception's ability to mask— or at the very least waste— his considerable talent.As for the movie's imagery, it is initially striking. Then, like the movie's narrative trope— a dream within a dream within a dream— it becomes simply repetitious. Whose dreams look so leaden and dull? And whose dreams are so relentlessly consistent and coherent? There are so many good movies that replicate the bizarre visual logic of dreams-- Vertigo, Badlands, The Last Wave, Videodrome, Blue Velvet, Until the End of the World. Has director Christopher Nolan ever seen any of these movies? Has he ever even had a dream? In short, Inception delivers some new cinematic tricks, but lacks emotional depth or provocative imagery. It's a notch above Hollywood's typical comic book based summer extravaganza, but only a notch.","

"markgorman","18 July 2010","Having seen this 24 hours ago the more I think about it the more I think this is over-hyped and actually a rather poor movie. On leaving the cinema I was prepared to give it a 7 (well short of it's 9.3 on IMDb) but on reflection I'm downgrading it to a 5.5.Why? For a start the writing is ridiculously weak. The plot, although slightly intriguing in that you do make the effort to keep up with the triple (or is it quadruple) levels of depth, is preposterous. In short it's about a dream within a dream within a dream. I think that's correct! But, that said, who cares? It might be crafty but it isn't crafted. It's self indulgent in the extreme.Whilst not gratuitously violent, there are a lot of killings in this film, but the ""goodies"" are dead eye dicks to a man (and woman) whilst the ""baddies"" are way, way beyond inept. With five targets and two and a half hours of incessant shooting I counted only 2 direct hits, whereas the ""baddies"" must have taken in excess of 200 fatalities. Just plain silly really.Then there's the casting. Di Caprio is starting to look desperate for a decent acting part and Ellen Page absolutely sucks compared to her magnificent role in Juno (it's the writing I tell ya).The special effects are at times good, on one or two occasions I'd call them remarkable, but not on many. As an emotional engagement exercise it has all the impact of a potato. I've been more moved by a night in watching Blomberg TV.Christopher Nolan is just not that great a director or writer on this occasion.Sorry folks.(His mind was the scene of a crime.)","

"briancham1994","9 June 2020","This movie was (and is) beloved by everyone so I don't expect to make any friends with my honest opinion - I was not impressed by Inception. Before I first watched this film, I was told that it would be complex and mind-blowing so I expected something like Nolan's earlier The Prestige (2006) which was masterful and one of my favourite films. Instead, we get a shallow imitation of that style. Inception is complex just for the sake of being complex - it doesn't add much value to the film, and the complexity is just overloading the audience's working memory which is not a clever technique at all. The characters were the worst part of the film. Apart from the main characters, they basically have no existence outside their role in the mission. We don't have any other reason to care about them. After a point, I just completely stopped caring whether they succeeded. Nothing felt compelling or of much consequence. I actually cared more about Cilian Murphy's character than the protagonists, to be honest. Because I lost my investment in the film, it just dragged out and became boring, especially some of the generic action scenes like the one in the snow. The ending is just cheap ambiguity rather than anything meaningful. That said, there were some good things about the film that I enjoyed. The visuals and effects were great, such as the transforming cities and the zero gravity. The best part was Hans Zimmer's score which remains one of my favourite soundtracks. Those aspects almost made up for the flaws - almost.","

"Michael_Elliott","23 July 2010","Inception (2010) *** 1/2 (out of 4)The ""kiss"" platform of recent years to keep it simple and stupid has pretty much ruined movies to a point as it's rare when one can walk into a movie and have a real workout on your brain. Sure, our eyes and ears are treated to amazing sites and loud noises each and every week and some would say this causes the brain just to lose any type of reality, which might be the reason certain people (cough Lohan, Hilton and countless others) are able to be hot stories while better, more worthwhile events are simply overlooked. If one doesn't want to use their brain then it's best to stay away from this thing. It's best not to know too much about the story but it deals with a troubled man (Leonardo DiCaprio) who has made it a job to break into people's dreams and steal their ideas. However, due to a personal tragedy, he is forced to take a job doing the opposite, which is breaking into a man's dream to plant an idea. That's pretty much all you need to know, storywise, as director/writer Nolan will deliver the rest and while the end result wasn't a pure masterpiece to me, there's no way you can deny the power it does contain. Dreams have always played an interesting part in movies but no other has taken you this far into them and delivered such incredible ideas. Not only does the screenplay deliver a lot to think about but we also get plenty of action and amazing scenes of destruction. The trailer showed people just a little pinch of a city turning upside down but seeing the full sequence was something truly amazing. Other amazing sequences was the entire final hour when our group of dream breakers must enter a multiple layer of dreams with one damaging effect after another. If you're familiar with Nolan then you already know what he can do and there's no question the man has talent but it is something special that a film like this could be pulled off at all. When you're dealing with multiple characters in multiple spaces and in multiple dream zones it would be easy and common for things to just fall apart under their own weight. It's very difficult to keep you guessing from one moment to another without things either falling apart or getting so complicated that the viewer simply gives up on the film and moves on. The amazing thing is that Nolan never lets up on the gas and instead just delivers one more bit of story on top of the next and I thought it was amazing that he could keep the viewing coming along for the ride and never lose us. I think some people are going to not understand what's going on or be able to figure out the multiple levels but when you kick back and think about what you've seen I think most will see that the maze had an entrance and an exit and nothing came as a cheat. DiCaprio delivers yet another wonderful performance but he's got a terrific cast around him including Ellen Page, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Cilliam Murphy, Pete Postlethwaite and a great return from Tom Berenger. Each actor does fine work in their roles and certainly help the story move along. The nature of the story is a very good one but the visual effects are just as good. Looking at all the action and amazing effects makes one really appreciate the acting, directing and story even more simply because they didn't get lost behind everything else that was going on. I don't think there's any question that one needs more than a single viewing to catch everything happening here but that's certainly not a bad thing since each viewing will deliver bits and pieces that will probably take the film into directions that you didn't think were there.","

Everyone gave this movie a 10 star rating even if they didn't saw it, because it was from the director of The Dark Knight (another disappointment, but less painful than this piece of crap), the audience are a bunch of sheeps.The story is predictable, the twists are predictable, the action scenes sucks, they sucked so much that i almost missed the ""action"" sequence of the Transformers movies (the live action ones).Why i give this movie a 2 stars ? one star for the cast and another one for the musical score.UPDATE: i had the misfortune to rewatch this piece of crap and my vote is 1, truly awful.","

"innocuous","27 July 2010","I doubt anybody will read this review, since it's neither a ""fan rave"" nor a ""hated it."" The movie gets four stars from me primarily because the CGI is not as bad as most other recent movies and Leo actually does some decent work. (Gordon-Levitt is also quite good, but he's canceled out by Ellen Page, who is, as usual, barely tolerable and not at all believable in her role.) Frankly, I just don't get the hype over ""Inception"" as metaphor, and it sure doesn't impress me as being a truly deep or complex movie. It's more like the level of the well-known character explaining how our solar system could actually itself be an atom, with the sun as the nucleus, etc.Actually, I take that back...it IS a complex movie. Needlessly complex, I might add. The whole set of rules for entering into (and out of) someone's dreams are so ridiculously complex that they obviously exist only to set up the action sequences. Unfortunately, this makes it necessary for all the characters to explain them to each other throughout most of the movie. (Why is this? If they're professionals at doing this sort of thing, why do they all need to have it explained to them each time? That's like reminding a soldier how to take the safety off his weapon just before exiting the personnel carrier.) Furthermore, the dream world is not dream-like. It's more like the virtual world of ""Tron."" If I were shown the action sequences with no exposition, I'd guess that the characters were in a virtual world, or in another dimension, but not in a dream.Finally, in spite of some good performances, I didn't give a lickspittle about the characters. What they are doing (or attempting to do) is immoral and unethical. And what risks they face are basically virtual as well. Who gives a flip? There's no redemption, no character development, no introspection (at any substantive level), and what you're left with is a mixture of pop psychology and ""the solar system itself may just be an atom."" This may be a good film on some levels, but I didn't care for it.","

"AJ4F","14 December 2010","There were only a handful of moments throughout ""Inception"" where I didn't feel like I was watching actors going through the motions of a plot too complex for them to keep track of during filming. I imagined the directorial staff telling them: ""Hey you, run over here, then turn around that way.....just do it, don't ask why right now!""I don't think DiCaprio was very well cast. He can be intense, but often comes off like a teenager posing as an adult. This role called for someone more eccentric with a mysterious presence. Likewise, the architect girl seemed like she belonged in high school, though she was nice to look at.The plot had a good premise but it barely got me involved psychologically. After the first hour or so, the layers of complexity got ahead of themselves and erased any real feeling of suspense. You need a decent grasp of what's actually going on to feel suspense. Due to the lack of focus, I found my eyes straying to things like the Joliesque bump on the wife's forehead, etc. A good film doesn't let the mind wander.After a point, this thing became so convoluted that I was trying to figure out how it was made (on a technical level) rather than putting serious effort into following the plot. Yes, I got the gist of the dream layers and the general plan, but the timing of the ""kicks"" became too hard to follow.I spent half my viewing time wondering why dreams, which in real life contain random absurdities, could be so precise, down to the timing of bombs. These dreams never seemed like ones I've experienced, so the main premise of the movie was ""kicked"" out the door early on. Technology- wise, it seems highly unlikely that people could share dreams except for random electrical pulses.Maybe it played better in a big theater with the crowd adding to the substantial hype that preceded it. I saw it at home on Blu-ray and it just didn't fire me up. I even considered turning it off twice, but the very end was clever enough to make it worth the slog.","

"BA_Harrison","4 April 2011","At what point does a film become too complicated for its own good? In the case of Inception, almost immediately: in a bid to make the ultimate 'mind-f**k' movie, writer/director Christopher Nolan starts his film at 'bloody confusing' and, over the course of 148 excruciatingly drawn-out minutes, works his way up to 'completely and utterly unfathomable' before leaving the film on a predictably ambiguous note (thus allowing endless discussion on movie forums).Along the way, Nolan introduces many an intriguing idea, but the ones that haven't been nicked from far better movies (eXistenZ, Vanilla Sky, The Matrix, Dark City, Cypher) are so half-baked that the film inevitably becomes a frustrating mess of contradiction and contrivance which conjures up an endless stream of questions (see IMDb's FAQs), none of which seem to have any satisfying answers (despite the best efforts of Nolan's rabid fan-boys).Lost in Inception's labyrinthine plot, all I could do was sit back and marvel at the special effects—which are undeniably impressive—whilst asking myself repeatedly how Ariadne (Ellen Page) became such a great architect despite no actual work experience, and whether such a pretty young woman would really be happy to be sedated in a grubby warehouse by a group of suspicious looking strangers. Somehow, I doubt it.5 out of 10 for its jaw-dropping effects (in particular, the awesome gravity-defying fight scene), and I reckon that's being generous.","

"Polaris_DiB","16 July 2010","People love to talk about the relationship between cinema and dreams. As a slightly surreal artform in and of itself, directors and artists have always tweaked with the filmic space of perception to achieve dream or dream-like effects. The problem I typically find in almost all movies attempting to recreate dreams is that they do so in too literal a way, often drawing attention to the dream effect they are portraying. This becomes even more difficult to pull off in movies that question the line between dreams and reality (a much more obvious line than pop philosophy ever really acknowledges) pretty much have to point out the dream techniques of the production you are watching. This is Nolan's central dilemma, and one he doesn't really manage to transcend. As a visual invention in technical prestidigitation, this movie is successful, but it is too bogged down by exposition to really let its dream-scapes breathe.Really, this movie is closer to The Matrix than Paprika, a Satoshi Kon animated movie I expected it to be closer to. A core group of technopirates get into people's dreams to steal information, but now they are a challenged by a corporate agent to actually plant an idea in the head of a target instead of steal the idea. This process is called inception. Now Nolan goes the correct route and centers the action around the head of the dream stalkers, Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Seems Cobb has some mental juju to work out that keeps ""projecting"" into the missions he undertakes (Nolan misses the point of Freudian ""projection"", but hits a cute pun on the very medium we are watching). So as these mercenaries of the subconscious get ready for their mission, it is complicated by the fact that their intrepid leader at any point can cause phantasmic chaos. Enter a few rules about dying and waking up, losing your mind and creating mental labyrinths, and you basically have the movie's own architecture for what ultimately, when it comes down to it, past all the rhetoric and screen wizardry, becomes a series of set-pieces.Nolan creates a world where this technology exists, and sets the rules of the technology. He then adds the element that in a world where that technology exists, rich people like Cobb's target would have defenses set up. These defenses translate into literal nobody adversaries for whiz bang action. In order that death seem actually like a bad thing (beyond just waking up), he sets Limbo. Then the movie goes, losing track of what is essentially at the core of everything the audience cares about--Cobb's inception, and the working through the guilt he has. I guess ultimately Nolan didn't want to remake Shutter Island. I'm not sure DiCaprio really felt a huge difference between either role.So we're not in legitimate dream world here. The characters are too aware, the dreamy twists on reality are pointed out and explained via direct real-world correlations, the subconscious is generally predictable and follows ineffectual actions from barely described motivations, and in order to get there Nolan has to cram way too much exposition into the first twenty minutes, instead of dwell on the central drama of the entire movie, Cobb and his wife. That's fine because then we're in Nolan's world, not dream world, and he can make any rules he wants. So he does, and you get... you know.... chase sequences, Siberian battles, explosions. If Nolan is expressing anything in his subconscious here, it's that he deeply regrets not having an opportunity yet to direct a James Bond movie.However it's not all that bad. The story of Cobb, the creation of the labyrinths, the technical beauty of it all is engaging science fiction cinema. The only root problem is Nolan's asking of the somewhat clichéd albeit age old question, ""What is the difference between dreams and reality?"" Because no filmmaker who brings up this question never answers that question definitively, audiences shouldn't expect for it to be here. However, Nolan does miss one definite thing about dreams that does not work in his scenario.In Inception, Cobb and his wife live, and age, for years in a dream world of their own creation. Later, his wife cannot tell if them waking up came to another level of dream, or if they finally achieved reality. I would just point out the obvious: In dreams, you never go to sleep. You may wake up, but even in Inception, going to sleep within sleep requires an apparatus.Problem solved.--PolarisDiB","

The trailers were great and the concept was intriguing. The problem was the execution. Once again, chase scenes, fights, explosions, special effects etc took the place of good writing. What could have been a cerebral movie just turned out to be another action movie. I do not want to take anything away from the special effects, they were very good and some were outstanding. My problem was that maybe there was only 30 minutes of actual plot and dialog in the entire movie. After a while, you quit wondering if it is real or a dream and just start dreaming that the movie will end soon. There are really no good twists and turns in the movie and little that is so thought provoking that you want to talk about the movie afterwords.My advice would be to take the special effects budget and spend it on some great writers.As the old commercial asked ""Is it real or is it Memorex?""

"raulfaust","9 September 2011","""Inception"" is for sure, an extremely original movie with a very professional cast and a wonderful photography direction. The background sound is phenomenon, it helps the suspense and the pacing of the movie. But what's the matter of all these things, when the film is extremely uninteresting and confusing? Christopher Nolan has this problem. I can easily compare this one to ""Memento"". Both have the same good things, but fill me with boredom and lack of interest, so I wasn't able to watch either films to the end. Maybe Nolan should let someone write his movies and he only directs; that would make them much better. Do not even consider seeing ""Inception"" if you didn't like ""Memento"", period.","

Those who are making this out to be something profound or mind-boggling are also delusional.All it is is a muddy film with tons of plot holes and slightly better-than-average special effects. I am completely amazed at the comments about this being something more than it is. ""The Matrix"" was far, far better, made far more sense and offered far more insight into human nature, love, etc.Nolan has made a ""cluster f__k"" that must have subliminally messaging going on in some theaters cuz nobody in our theater enjoyed it very much. The acting is superb. There's one really cool scene of Paris defying gravity. Other than that there is nothing new and there is little or no logical plot line. It is just as my title says, convoluted. I'm a writer and this is the kind of stuff I delete from my novels when I begin to stray or run on.There's one review here that understands what is going on with the people who have fallen for this nightmare... he says ""There are movies for stupid people. There are movies for smart people. Then there are movies for people who like to think they're smart."" He has hit the proverbial nail on the head. This is a movie a few, likely stoned college fanboys go to see, start a conversation about ""what if..."" and create something out of nothing. Any intelligent person begins to have serious trouble coming up with answers that truly fit the massive questions in Nolan's script. To pass it off as ""well, it's all a dream"" is just a cop out. The movie doesn't really work. The dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream is just a way for him to cover his mistakes.This movie deserves a high 7 at best. In time, it will drop considerably on this site... perhaps to near #100. But that will only be due to Nolan fans. True movie buffs will never fall for this fantasy. It's ordinary storytelling and a ""make-it-up-as-you-go-along"" script.Go back to schools everyone. Stop doing drugs. This is not a fine wine... it is carbonated fruit punch.

"nelliebell-1","9 January 2011","Inception is a lie and like all legitmate hollywoods irregardless of who is doing what to whom there is only the technology that allows this hysterical calculator(that is all this film represents) in this motion picture to perhaps make money.There seems not much more to suggest and that would be if this film made money,? Well did it ? This is what is a most unusual point to all this,and that would be if this particular film did not make money what else is this film doing if in fact it did not make money? What is required to know better or perhaps to truly know well what the viewer is looking at when as a viewer,the viewer as it were watches the motion picture ""Inception"".There is as well another consideration and that is if in fact the very participation in the watching of any motion picture is such an experience as to be a unwholesome experience. I believe it is that(unwholesome) and even more so provides for a disguise so to mislead any who might be drawn for what ever reason to watch such a film or for that matter to watch such are the films of Hollywood,California.There is no degree of involvement in the making of this film that is in fact authentic and as illegitimate that that might sound like it is an illegal search and seizure which allows a thief to be masqueraded as the man with the candy.This film is not new nor is this film what it appears as is as well.The result when viewing such a film is that there is no time that is real nor is there a place as to any particular event is concerned and if that isn't enough there is no definition as to not if there is a capacity to dream but how do we provide the ability to interject another ability that could pass as a dream.This is the handiwork of a masquerade with any here who believe believe not in this motion picture as there is no dreaming there is only the ability to transmit the stimulus with the image that is what masquerades as a ""dream"".It is as well imposed upon the body of the human race so to provide a unmistakable influence.The influence as the film provides such a witness has a goal of influence pure and simple this film is merely more of the same as the same has meant since as it were its inception.It is its invention that is at the source of this worlds ability to influence anything with merely more of the same being all that the viewer will ever be looking at.The inventor as well as the inventors many inventions are all patented and do it is believed remain so.There were some 700 separate inventions with which this unwholesome day in this world occurred when one Nicola Tesla discovered how to bind energy across wide open space many many miles from nowhere including even deepest darkest space.This is the field of regard it is as well the ability to network with many disparaging elements so to influence even say Adolf Hitler(I kid you not).Though 1920 is the year of radio's invention and 1921 the year Berlin radio started to broadcast it was a good time before this point in time that Tesla's inventions and subsequent patents were in place.The better premise would be to know through Tesla's own words as to what capacity does what he invented provide and without to much trouble Tesla's's own misgivings provide for the very problem of being under the influence of a lie.Though this lie was not meant to interfere with the human race that is exactly what has occurred.The money men of Teslas's own day are at the root cause as to the necessity to influence anything outside of an antenna.They remain as perhaps a cog in the wheel that very nearly saw to its conclusion not to long ago.This wasn't Tesla's design this was there influence on his attempt to bind energy that it was not to be unless of course they could extract a measure if you will of revenge upon humanity.This is the masquerade that there is a profit motive in this foreign power as well as an aggression not to be deterred in its inability to be regulated properly.This is an imperfect science which has meted out suffering through this field of regard.(network field)It is this thief in the night and it is as well the exploiter of human flesh that this film is providing the viewer with.This is what this film is up to and it has been such since it inception.","

Money doesn't seem to be the problem here. This is a big plot hole that makes his entire quest unneccesssry. Just live somewhere else together!The biggest problem I have with this movie is that it isn't 'intelligent' at all. It's a novel idea, yes, but the execution isn't that intelligent. Basically we are told many rules (the bath tub, the architect, dream in dream time, the token, and much more) but it all ends up being an ordinary action flick with cheap chases, e.g ski scene, shooting bad guys chasing in the city, floating people fighting each other, and so forth. 
Nothing really interesting is done with architecting and manipulating environments in dreams, building 'mazes' and the actual 'incepting'. It's like introducing a 10-man band with cool musical instruments and amazing musicians, and then only stick to playing basic children songs. Nolan tends to forget the ""show don't tell"" rule, an issue also present in Interstellar.","

And then, to add to the confusion, we had dreams within dreams within dreams! If the complex plot had an internal logic which appeared not to defeat Leonardo DiCaprio - it certainly defeated me. There is considerable homage to the MATRIX films, with aerial fights and frozen motion sequences: kid's stuff, but what do kids make of the anarchic storyline? If you die in someone else's dream, you can either wake up alive or go to a place called Limbo (not the same as the one Dante envisaged) which looked like the flooded New York of The Day After Tomorrow a few decades on. The plus side of Limbo for Leo was that it reunited him with his dead wife (Marion Cotillard), but was this his limbo or hers? Best not to ask.If MEMENTO, with time running backwards, was Christopher Nolan's ""set text"" for Filmgoing GCSE, I guess INCEPTION represents A-Level movie comprehension.And I seem to have failed.","

"cmoyton","1 January 2011","I suppose you have to hand it to Chris Nolan. He made Warners so much money with his Batman revamp that was able to call the shots and sell not only them but a large segment of the (i suspect mostly male) movie going audience this risible turd of celluloid.Forget about the unoriginality (The Matrix, the architect), the protracted opening 45 minute snooze fest explanation and the sleepwalking acting (Dicaprio included). What really bugged me was that the whole corporate espionage yarn was a complete red herring. It was an excuse to tag on some action sequences that some impressive CG aside were really nothing to shout about. The alpine scene (sorry layer) was especially lame. I almost expected to see Burton and Eastwood appear on screen chased by Nazi mountain troops. Maybe someone could have dreamt them into the story at this point. Or even James Bond.Plot summary and spoiler alert below- You see Dicaprio had this problem with his wife committing suicide instigated by a previous inception so to rid him of her malign influence from his own dreams we are given this convoluted tedium in which another character who may be real or more likely may not be real eventually pops the wife in a dream so that Lenny can see his kids again, in a dream. Please.","

"zadkine","24 July 2010","This movie is a disaster on many levels, but where it fails most miserably is at attempting to put dreams on screen. This movie is the most un-dreamy movie ever made, and as critics have said since the beginning of moving pictures, watching a movie is like dreaming with your eyes open. Colin McGinn covers this in great depth in his book ""The Power of Movies"", in which he discusses the spatio-temporal discontinuity in films: the camera can record a given scene and then leap to another place and time entirely. This is what movies do! Nolan treats this heavy-handed hopping about as if he's discovered something. What he's lost is the mysterious, moody, enigmatic quality of dreams, the tremendous emotional wallop. ""Inception"" is so detailed, so measured, with constant explication, that nothing is left to the imagination. How ironic is that? And to fill a movie about dreams with carefully designed car chases, gun battles, and mayhem of all kind...it's anti-dreaming. I've never watched a film so awake, so aware of itself, so full of itself. A hundred years from now when cultural historians look at this era of Runaway Bigism - Big Government, Big Corporations, Big Bodies! - they can use over-blown and spiritually empty films like this (and ""Dark Knight"") as good examples of what ruined the country. Wretched excess.","

"Rindiana","11 August 2010","Another phenomenally over-hyped blockbuster from Nolan, which - like all his movies - is nothing else but a pseudo-clever, emotionally cold and pompous high gloss product that's masquerading as intelligent mainstream entertainment.It's such fun to watch all the movie geeks and oh-so literate critics (and almost everyone in between) fall for well-packaged, but thoroughly trivial nonsense like this with such aplomb. It's as if all the stupid action movies and (romantic) comedies Hollywood is churning out regularly have led to a yearning for something more profound... though the big guns and larger-than-life stars are still not to be missed, of course.This one's in the same league as ""Matrix"", though much more elaborate in its twisted ways. (Just listen to the constantly exchanged plot explanations between the characters, which get unintentionally funny after a while.) One watches pics like these applauding the makers, without investing deeper thoughts or emotions. One's much too puzzled to feel anything.By the way, this must've been the longest showdown I've ever seen in any movie. Afterwards, I felt like that ancient Asian guy.5 out of 10 ever-whirling roundabouts","

"MarilynManson","24 July 2010","Contrary to the opinions of the deluded army of comic reading Nolan fanboy geeks who have descended on IMDb, Christopher Nolan has entirely and irrevocably disappeared up his own self inflated backside with this movie. I say The Emperors New Clothes because the director will sneer at anyone who doesn't understand the film and he has thus created a perfect defence mechanism. I'm sure Di Caprio et al had in depth briefings about the narrative and can explain it verbatim but us viewers are left to work it out for ourselves. And it's so full of holes, so full of irrelevant tripe and so full of itself that it isn't easy. It's incredible that its been voted the 3rd best film of all time by IMDb users. I mean seriously, that's a joke. The fanboys all want to laud Nolan as the new Kubrick (another joke) but in doing so they have voted this tosh above ALL of Kubricks work. It's such a smug self congratulatory film from the get go and it just gets smugger as time drags on.Now of course I appreciate that you can go too far in explaining every detail to the viewer with unnecessary script mechanics that insult the viewers intelligence. However, although you can go too far in explaining, you can also go too far in NOT explaining and expect the viewer to grasp in a single viewing what is a massively complex concept film - and one that's so badly flawed in so many areas for it to undermine the whole 'intellectual' nature of it. The idea of the film is OK and the film does have its moments but there are so many scenes that don't make sense that it spoils it entirely. I appreciate that 'heist' movies are usually procedural and that Nolan wanted to avoid that but in doing so he's created the most self-indulgent picture ever.I could go on about the snow scene, the thoroughly implausible way these people not only do what they do but 'assemble' as a team, the oh-I'm-Christoper-so-considerably-cleverer-than-you-are-Nolan backstory with Di Caprio's wife but I'm not going to pick apart the scenes because I'd be here for hours and I haven't got the energy left after enduring this nonsense. Besides; everything could be spun that he meant this or that (he isn't as deep as he likes you to think). Inception is all fur coat and no knickers. It explains so little of what is going on that I left feeling angry. And I generally get these films so it's not a case of me being some moronic fool who struggles to follow the weather. And billed as a completely original idea? Nah. There's obvious similarities with The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Flatliners, Vanilla Sky, Pan's Labyrinth, Dream Demon and even one of the Star Trek Next Generation Episodes centred around the holodeck, all of which I've 'gotten' - the good ones, the bad ones, the ones you ponder for days afterwards. The fact is with this abomination I simply can't be bothered to think about it because I really don't care. I don't care about the characters, I don't care about the ending (which was excruciatingly predictable) and I don't care about how clever Nolan thinks he is. You're not mate. You've pulled a massive con with this film by creating a movie where you can call people stupid if they don't get it / like it. You get to sneer and snigger at the stupid little people. You've taken your previous successes to the movie execs and they've foolishly allowed themselves to fund your rampant self indulgence. That's what irritates me the most about this utter piffle. I understood what was understandable about this film and there are of course films where the intention is to purposely let the viewer fill in the gaps with their own imagination (generally a nice touch) but that simply isn't the case here. The story script and indeed most of the awful acting (outside of Di Caprio, Juno girl and Cillian Murphy) neither holds it together nor papers over the cracks of a weak script that's trying to be oh so deep... and badly failing.This is over 120 minutes of my life that I will never ever get back and I simply couldn't wait for the film to end. I had lost all interest in any of the characters, their backstorys or indeed the 'mission' after an hour once I woke up to the fact that he was clearly unable to pull the film together into something coherent and genuinely contemplative. And judging by the rest of the audience and the people I was with, I wasn't the only person who left feeling bitterly cheated. I congratulate Nolan on creating hysteria, mass hypnosis and hype because he's clearly managed to brainwash a lot of the audience into making them think they've seen a clever film. That's the only inception.Go and see this insidious fluff for a visual experience perhaps (even then; visually it's pretty overrated). But don't be surprised if you feel a strange peer group pressure to tell whoever you go to see it with that you understood it all when you probably didn't (or if you did; that you actually care and did so in spite of a dumb script).Nolan is not nor ever will be Kubrick. Kubrick would have done this film justice - after he had rewritten the script, changed half the cast, removed 45 minutes of length and replaced it with sensible content that made the film engaging and cohesive. I fear the next set of people to be duped will be those who vote for this trite idiocy come the Oscars.BTW I wager that Nolan watched Guy Ritchies Revolver and liked it. Congratulations Christopher, you have just descended to his level of filmmaking.Meh.","

"JasonIK75","24 July 2010","I don't get all the positive reviews for this movie. I found it overlong and I could not find a reason to care about any of the characters. Technically speaking, there was no true heroic character, as it was a bunch of technologically-advanced criminals and their victims. At several points during the movie I was pleading ""Go home! Go home!"" It had a decent idea but I have to think that Rod Serling (RIP) probably could have done a much better job with this and he would have done it in a shorter time. I really think the writers and producers could have made a tighter film with better and more interesting characters. Christopher Nolan did terrific, terrific work with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but this film is unworthy of its success.","

"petra_ste","3 April 2014","Say what you want of Nolan, the new populist demigod of Hollywood: that his movies are overplotted, his themes overstated, his structure wonky. However, you have to give it to Chris: he is generous. Other writers/directors live and die by a single gimmick, but he keeps throwing more and more ambitious stuff at the screen - he reminds me of Philip K. Dick, another artist who casually poured in a few pages more ideas than many of his colleagues used in a half-dozen books.Nolan has the same high-concept vitality: amnesiac protagonist tries to avenge his wife guided by tattoos on his body and Polaroid pictures (still his best, by far); a feud between illusionists in early 20th century London gets increasingly nasty.In Inception, con men use a special technology to navigate through people's dreams and steal their secrets. From the tone-perfect James Bond prologue to the climactic hurricane of set pieces, the movie transcends its limits - its clunky rules and the fact the dream world mechanics are not exploited as creatively as they could have - and succeeds thanks to its juicy premise and jaw-dropping cast, with Di Caprio in another of his ""tormented young man"" turns he has been perfecting since The Departed, Michael Caine, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy.Then we have gorgeous Marion Cotillard in Inception's most poignant idea - the protagonist, obsessed by his dead wife, tries to recreate her, but she ends up as a distorted, menacing memory haunting his fragile dream world.8/10","

"MTNmovieMan","6 March 2011","I waited patiently to see this in my updated home theater on Blu-ray with anticipation and excitement, mainly based on the high scores given it by IMDb and the knowledge that it had everything; cast, sound, scenery, story, etc. OK, it looked impressive, it was loud enough, but after 2 ½ hours my jaw was on floor in utter amazement at how stupid people can be praising this trash - lemmings. But maybe it's explainable: The ten star reviews here are from those either involved directly in the marketing of this film or 9 year old boys using their parents credentials to praise an adolescent epic or I suppose idiots who swallow tripe and enjoy making recommendations to others about how yummy their tripe tasted. The latter I almost doubt as the intellectually challenged might have difficulty in forming sentences and operating a computer machine so just who are these thousands of reviewers praising theatrical garbage? It absolutely has to be my first guess; Armies of trolls hired by the makers of Crapception.I can't even get myself to offer my reasons for disliking this film as there's nothing to review but I'll try: The repetitive overlapping of scenes seemed more to me like a demo video testing the CGI production equipment. The complete absence of explanation as to how someone can actually share a dream I feel was the biggest hole, and the hole just got deeper and deeper and more deep and then deeper still resulting in probably the most shallow of scripts ever produced for that much money.I typically like DiCaprio but the Cisco girl; Ellen Page was annoying, felt like I had a bad Juno dream during a TV commercial selling conferencing equipment and a horribly dressed adolescent was trapped in my dream spun mind. OK, that last sentence could have come straight from the writers pen of this horrible script.Not all is lost however, a valuable lesson was learned in how I will now use IMDb. I feel I can no longer rely on the score of films here and will, instead, sort reviews by lowest rank and make my viewing decisions from there. My biggest disappointment is the watering down of what once was a great resource for movie choices: IMDb. Since I'm a movie addict I've relied on IMDb since its inception, pun intended, but with Inception's 8.7 score I now see the source data is tainted and the source unreliable. IMDb might be able to fix this by taking measures to identify the reviewers and allow us to sort by them: Kids, adults, trolls, (multiple reviews from a single IP address for example) OK, maybe it's not that easy, the WEB is fraught with mistruths and deception for insipid products and offerings so why would my favorite web site be immune from this condition? I give this film 2 stars for pretty colors and loud noises.","

"rmax304823","18 June 2011","Around 750, the renowned poet of the Tang dynasty, Li Po, is supposed to have asked, ""Last night I dreamed I was a butterfly. Today, am I a butterfly dreaming I am a man?"" Marcus Aurelius, the late Roman emperor and philosopher, wrote, ""Life is a dream, a little more coherent than most."" Freud concluded that dreams were the fulfillment of unconscious wishes that had managed to sneak past the dozing censor. Aboriginal Australians believed in a real parallel universe called The Dream Time in which everything and everyone who ever existed, still existed, and anybody could enter this place during sleep.Modern psychology believes that dreams are nothing more than random cortical bombardment caused by a lot of activity in sub-cortical structures associated with the filing of memories, and the cortex goes into overdrive trying to make narrative sense of them. Sex dreams are pleasant enough except when the furry little animals show up, but statistics demonstrate that the majority of dreams are truly lousy, the kind we can easily live without. Don't you get tired of running in slow motion through a swamp while being chased by an ogre? Does all this sound like pointless rambling to you? Well, then you're not going to enjoy ""Inception"" because it meanders at lightning speed all over the place and lives by no rules that human beings have ever known.On the other hand, if you find these adventitious allusions in some way interesting, then you should see this dark and muddled movie. You get a bonus too, because in its style it closely resembles an action movie from the 1980s. Everything is happening all at once -- or maybe not all at once. Who cares? The point is that people get shot in the forehead and buildings comes toppling down for no reason and slow-motion explosions take place at irregular but short intervals.I'm getting pretty tired of seeing films that use some bewildering metaphysical scheme as an excuse to show off still more CGIs. I couldn't watch this thing through.","

"inframan","6 March 2011","The only moments that had dream-like qualities in the movie were the times I dozed off & my own dreams (many times more imaginative I might add) took over. To be blunt about it, Inception is not so much about dreams as about the world of video games. Even more telling than the gratuitous CGI effects was the clunky narrative device of having the characters explain in overly verbose dialog where & when each segment was taking place (levels, locations, psychological motivations, etc.). Like having to follow instructions of a poorly designed game. Ugh. The popularity of this snoozer is very sad testimony to the mediocrity of the average movie-going intelligence.","

"mukava991","4 March 2011","""Inception"" seems to be taking the premises of such films as ""Peter Ibbetson,"" ""Altered States,"" ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" to more elaborate lengths. Throughout this action flick – and that is what it truly is, despite its pretenses – I couldn't help thinking of the most recent James Bond thriller in which I lost track of who was who among the secondary characters because the identities they started with were revealed as false, but then the revelation itself was proved equally false (or at least dubious), to the point where you couldn't believe a word they were saying and ultimately you ceased to care. With ""Inception"" we get a lot of technical jabbering from the mouths of Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page about what everything means or might mean as they ""share"" and ""engineer"" other people's dreams in order to infiltrate their subconscious to achieve their corporate goals. These dream states are filled with the usual action staples of racing and crashing vehicles, explosions and the liberal use of automatic weapons, accompanied here by huge crumbling cityscapes (less effective than the more modest melting away of various smaller environments in ""Eternal Sunshine""). There is nothing particularly dreamy about writer-director Christopher Nolan's dream world; aside from a few interesting computer-generated images like a whole city appearing to fold over upon itself, none of the effects stick in the mind or affect the viewer's juices. Marion Cotillard contributes her trademark broken heartedness. Page gives the same performance we are familiar with from her telesystems commercials. Cillian Murphy emotes richly as the kidnapped son of an energy industry magnate. The heaving score by Hans Zimmer sounds like hundreds of others.","

"preppy-3","25 July 2010","A mess about ""mind pirates""...or something. They enter peoples minds, bend reality and are hired to help a man to change his dying fathers mind to get control of his estate...but there are OTHER people who are trying to stop them.Wow! What a total disaster! This is one of those movies that make so little sense that people just assume they're not intelligent enough to ""get it"" and fall all over themselves praising it. This movie is not some revolutionary trend setter--does anyone remember ""The Matrix"" from 20 year ago? Also it sets up the rules of what's going on at the beginning. That's fine but they're thrown at you so fast and furious (with NO explanation) that I was totally lost. Then, after establishing the rules, they CHANGE them for no other reason than to confuse the plot and throw viewers off. THEN they introduce new rules when we're well into the movie! That's not clever or intriguing--it's playing with the viewers mind and deliberately making them lost and confused. To make it worse the acting pretty much sucks. Ellen Page is horrendous (and her character is never fully introduced or explained) and Joseph Godron-Levitt sleepwalks through his role. DiCaprio (who I THOUGHT was a good actor) is terrible. He gives yet another performance of a man who's tortured by some dark past and trying to get through it. He's done this many times before (""Revolutionary Road"", ""Shutter Island""). Can't he do anything else? Also when he breaks loose and start yelling I didn't believe it for one second and I couldn't take it seriously. I've seen that before! The admittedly great special effects can't help. I walked out after 90 minutes. The movie is constantly pulling the rug out from under the viewers and I got this smug attitude that the filmmakers were having a fun time playing with the viewers and thinking they were smarter than they actually were. Dull, annoying and very full of itself. Don't bother.","

Leonardo has made some great films, but after Shutter Island I became less of a fan. I rate Shutter Island only slightly better, but both are a let down for me. I am sure lots of people will dislike my take on this over hyped film, what kills the story for me, it has all these different layers inside layers, sure the idea is O.K but it is not very well done in this film, just one big mess of special effects, that leaves me just feeling very flat.

I never do this, commenting on a movie I haven't seen in its entirety, but I will make an exception in this case because it reeked of pretentious and ""interesting"" from the very start. Christopher Nolan must be so full of it by now, with the success of the Batman series, that he thinks he can discard some platitude on to the screen, by relying on big stars and some teenage fantasy...and by the way, other than Watanabe,Caine and Berenger, what's with all the teenage looking actors (I have to admit, good ones)? For a second there, I thought they are turning Beverly Hills 90210 into a movie. I admire Leonardo di Caprio as an actor, but if I ever see him in an action man-hero sequence again, I'll call Kate Winslet to squash him like a bug (in Titanic, she looked huge compared to him),he's just not believable in those roles (and I thought Charlie Sheen looked ridiculous in the 80' s and '90's) no matter how much he tries, sometimes it works sufficiently, sometimes it doesn't but the fact that he seems to look for those roles all the time, and what a shame, compared to his earlier roles.I'll just stop here, I've rarely received such a bad vibe from a movie.

It's just bad, substituting elementary (and wrong) psychobabble for plot. It's science fiction and fantasy, it doesn't have to conform to real life but it should conform to its own rules. The acting was wooden, which is due to the bad script because each of these actors can hold their own elsewhere. The pacing is glacial. We are continually being preached at about the subconscious, but it's all like an Agatha Christie novel, with a surprise, unforeseen and unannounced deus ex machina just popping up here and there to wrap things up. Like, it's really complicated because there are these things called ""levels"" to dreaming and the subconscious. If the director spent ten years writing this script, he should get another job. It looks like it was pasted together in a couple of days over a few too many mai-tais. Some interesting visuals, but that's all there is.","

"filipemanuelneto","29 December 2016","This film revolves around the theft of ideas, pushed to the limit, with the thief entering into the mind of another person through a dream made for that purpose. It has the main actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy (all in the guise of a team of thieves of ideas) and Ken Watanabe (in the role of a powerful Japanese chairman). Christopher Nolan took charge of the script and direction.It is undoubtedly an interesting, intellectually challenging and well-crafted film. The rich and intricate script gives us a solid, well-imagined story with good characters (the two main characters, attributed to DiCaprio and Watanabe, are even more worked and function as antagonists). Despite this, the contained and reserved form as the characters demonstrate emotions makes the movie a bit cold from the emotional point of view. The emotions are there, they just prefer to demonstrate them in a discreet way. The script could have even explored the emotional and psychological consequences of stealing ideas, for the thief and for those who are robbed, but prefers to remain in the realm of material consequences. The end of the film is good but, from a certain moment, it becomes slow and predictable. Despite this, praise is given to the performance of Nolan as well as the main actors. DiCaprio fulfilled our expectations, Ellen Page was a pleasant surprise and the rest of the cast was up to the challenge.Although not a perfect movie, there is no doubt that it is good. It's a movie that will be more pleasing to the more intellectual, audiences who do not like movies where thinking is needed to understand it will probably have more difficulty in enjoying it.","

"mach1ne","20 July 2010","This film really let me down.I didn't expect a great film but I expected something that was at least 'OK'. How wrong I was. I honestly can't understand the hype. 'Intelligent' they say?? What sort of intelligent film has to have it's protagonists explain what is happening continuously throughout the film?? Now Memento, that was a good film. And, I suppose, 'intelligent'. But by intelligent, I mean something that pushes boundaries of the viewer's understanding. I don't mean intelligent as in 1) able to do simple arithmetic, 2) develop reading and writing skills and 3) generally being one notch above a dolphin.OK, let's make a start shall we? Firstly, one of the greatest literary and cinematic arts is the use of metaphor. This film has none. One thing the film is full of is too much explanatory dialogue (not to mention pre-teen psychology - the father figure relationship in the subconscious). For example, in the first Matrix film, the viewer understands the profundity of what is being delivered through metaphor (a feature that the subsequent Matrix films sadly missed). In this film here, everything is painstakingly explained. To me, this speaks volumes.Secondly, great actors, yes. BUT ALL miscast and given appalling dialogue in an appalling script. I mean, Ellen Page was great in Juno, but here she comes out with painfully mechanical lines in the same way that Joseph Gordon-Levitt also does. In the same way that every character does. They ALL speak the same way and we are no better understanding one character by the end of the film than we were when they first appeared.Thirdly, logic. Philosophy. Call it what you want. Why was Ariadne chosen to become the architect? What does she actually DO??And Ken Watanabe. Why is he alive after dying on the third or fourth level 'down' in the subconscious after the film so adamantly stresses the dangers of dying in the 'dream'? How can he wake up on the plane?? Why, in fact, is there that scene at the start of the film where he appears old and which features the safe and the confidential papers Leonardo De Caprio finds.Why does Leonardo De Caprio constantly have to furrow his brow? Oh, yes, it's a vain attempt to look mean and manly because the poor man still has, unfortunately for him, such a baby face.Why is Cillian Murphy's character chosen to be their means of helping LDC's character get back to his kids? And isn't it convenient to have a dream sequence in a blockbuster that resembles a James Bond film snow-covered chase scene? Why does the film have to go on for two and a half hours instead of one and a half? And most importantly, if Leonardo De Caprio's character is so severely screwed up about his wife why, o why does he have to be the main character in this film? Couldn't the team work with someone more well-balanced?? Can he in fact be any use to his kids if he eventually finds them???Nonsense nonsense nonsense. Big pile of nonsensical psycho-babble. And yes, where else but America???","

"ThomasDrufke","24 August 2014","I decided to go back and review Inception because this would be my 100th review written for IMDb. And Interstellar is coming in a few months so I guess now is a good time to celebrate one of the greatest films of all time. After dozens of times watching this movie I ranked it as my third favorite movie of all time. Rightfully so, considering it's one of the few movies that changed my life and got me infinitely interested in film in general. From top to bottom this is one true cinematic accomplishment. Christopher Nolan created a worldwide phenomena and did it with an original idea. Popular and financially successful movies these days almost always have to be part of a bigger franchise. Inception made nearly a billion dollars while being just a solo outing. This wasn't Nolan's first home run twisting our minds and it won't be his last but he most likely won't create a more original movie than Inception. It's one of those movies that after you see it, you instantly want to go back and watch it again.The cast is flooded with Hall of Fame level talent. Beginning with Leonardo DiCaprio in his first and hopefully not last film with Christopher Nolan. These two created a perfect team and I couldn't have pictured a better actor for the role of Dom Cobb. I love how the movie doesn't give us any back story on his character and almost assumes that planting ideas inside peoples minds is normal. Joseph Gordon-Levitt creates a good balance with Cobb in his role as Arthur. JGL was well known among Hollywood for awhile but Inception catapulted his career to a new level. He doesn't get his roles in Looper, Lincoln, The Dark Knight Rises, or even get to direct his film Don Jon without starring in Inception. Easily some of the best scenes in the movie are him trying to calm down Cobb and understand why it is he cant focus while in the dream world. This is when the beautiful Marion Cotillard comes into play. She plays the recently passed wife of Cobb, but someone who doesn't seem to leave Cobb's subconscious. Her accent and seductiveness was perfect for Mal Cobb and also shared some of the not only epic but also psychologically thrilling scenes.The rest of the team is filled with rising stars Tom Hardy, Ellen Page, and the ever-so-underrated Ken Watanabe. Page is one who in the trailers seemed to come across as annoying and useless but I was pleasantly surprised with how great her performance was. Overall the cast is one of the best ensembles ever put together, without forgetting the always good Michael Caine. But the real praise goes out to Hans Zimmer for creating my favorite and quite possibly one of the greatest scores of all time. 'Time' is my favorite single piece of music, but the rest of the score hits at exactly the right times. It's explosive and also emotionally moving when it needs to be. Zimmer found the perfect mix of brass and piano to use in this Oscar snubbed score.But I think the real reason this film became so popular and re-watchable was because of it's forever debatable ending. What's my take on it? Well after replaying it for years and going back and forth on what my opinion is I would say that it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if he is suppose to be dreaming or finally back to reality. You know why? Because Dom Cobb doesn't care. When he sees his children's faces in the end that was the final straw. He doesn't even bother looking at the top spinning because it means he is getting to see his children. He is accepting the fact that his wife is dead and never coming back and moving on from that fact. I really do believe that he had reached reality but I always love hearing the new theories people come up with. I have basically heard them all at this point but it doesn't matter because Cobb has accepted his fate. True props to Nolan for creating material that people are sure to be talking about for years to come.So after over a decade of Nolan having his idea for Inception he finally got it made. Warner Bros gave him the go ahead after he made them billions with the Batman films and could it have been a better decision? I don't think so. Nolan created a film that has impeccable practical effects with an unbelievable ensemble cast complimented with perfect cinematography and a haunting score. If there's ever such thing as a perfect film this is it. It's one of the few movies that makes me cry thinking about how great cinema is when its done with the care like Inception is. It renews my faith in Cinema.+DiCaprio and ensemble cast give career defining performances+Originality can't be topped +Hans Zimmer's exhilarating score+Practical effects (Hotel Scene) +Forever debatable ending +Gave America Marion Cotillard +Final scene +TIME 10/10","

"ashleybelsham","1 September 2010","OK here goes. I'll prepare myself for an ass kicking.I finish watching this film thinking are you guys really watching the same film as me!!?? Does this film really deserve 9.1 out of 10??? (1st sept 2010).I found this film incredibly frustrating. So I guess at the start you learn what a cool concept the film is based on. Nice idea. Very interesting. So why take over 2hrs to get to the point!!?? I fell asleep twice whilst watching it and still managed to catch the end - not feeling that i'd missed anything important.I didn't really like the characters. In these films you tend to connect with as least ONE character but I didn't feel it here at all.So some of you like the FX?? Yeah that ONE scene they used in the trailer. The one they sold the film on.Oh yeah. The last rant....i cant stand films where they introduce rules and details that only apply in the next few scenes. It so annoying and predictable. They do that a lot in this film.So anyway. I left asking myself and the other people I saw this with why this film is so overrated and there are a lack of bad reviews about it. We concluded its one of these trendy films that are meant to be clever and intelligent. I think people will be afraid of saying bad points about this just in case it suggests that they don't understand the concept. I for one did understand it, I just didn't like it. I certainly don't think it deserves 9.1 out of 10.My suggestion....just go and rent Matrix or Minority Report or something like that. Clever, visually brilliant AND enjoyable.","

"bobdude-2","21 June 2012","Inception - I saw this a while ago. I only write about it, because South Park was making fun of it last night. I never got the enthusiasm for this flick. It was somewhat entertaining, although, certainly not mind blowing or even that inventive. I've seen more mind bending things on the Outer Limits from the 60's. It was not memorable. In fact, I had forgotten about it until last night. One of the things I remember was how poorly Ellen Page's character was rounded out. I remember laughing, not at her - but at the part she had to play, Ms. Exposition. Explain everything to her, so the audience knows what is going on. The action was cliché, and left me wanting more. The whole thing about going into someone's dream is so silly, but not funny silly - which leads me to...South Park, on the other hand. Was a lot more fun. Throw in a Sheep Herder, a young Mr. Mackey, a random pizza delivery guy, and even a retired Freddy Kruger and you've got an entertaining 22 minutes. And, of course, Randy Marsh. Stan is trapped in Mr. Mackey's dream, so Randy goes in to save him. Stan sees his dad in the dream. But his dad has come into the dream as a Butterfly. Stan says ""Did you come here to help me?"" and Randy replies ""I was gonna...Butterflies have no concern for these things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterfly poon."" So much better than watching inception.","

"zkonedog","11 March 2017","This film features one of the most innovative concepts of all-time, that of ""dreams within dreams"" and similar fare. But is it a classic? Not quite, due to some ""can't quite put my finger on it"" lack of overall execution.For a basic plot summary, ""Inception"" deals in the world of shared dreams, in which individuals (while asleep) can enter the dream of another and insert/extract information. When an ""inception"" team (led by Leonardo DiCaprio) is put together for an especially difficult assignment, they must go deeper into the mark's head than ever before.In terms of grandiose ideas, ""Inception"" is truly a mind-boggling concept that will intrigue you right from the get-go. The visual effects are spectacular and innovative, while the whole scope of the movie is often staggering.Here's the ""problem"", though: This isn't a movie that will stick with me for any prolonged period of time (and thus makes me unable to give it five stars). The plot execution and character development just left a little too much to be desired in sacrifice to the ideas. I can't quite put my finger on it, but (besides the incredible science fiction"", ""Inception"" just isn't an all-time classic.Thus, while an entertaining watch, I rank ""Inception"" well below ""The Matrix"" (very similar concepts) and about on par with ""Shutter Island"". Enjoy it far what it is, but don't expect it to be the greatest movie you've ever seen.","

"E-un","7 January 2011","It could possibly be Leonardo DiCaprio. That's a bit harsh – I know he has to eat too – but does he have to always play the same sanctimonious, pedantic, self-righteous know-it-all? And he's been in some bad movies recently. ""Revolutionary Road"" was a potentially good movie, but he always comes off as immature. ""Shutter Island"" was so transparent that I guessed the ending about 10 minutes in. But, this is supposed to be about ""Inception""...Yes, ""Inception"", a movie so simplistic that I yawned throughout. My (lucky) wife fell asleep claiming that it wasn't of interest to her. What claimed to be a smart, intelligent thriller, turned out to be the usual bag of guns, explosions, chases, etc. The plot, paper-thin and without any real point, is a yawn-fest of borrowed ideas and takes liberally from movies we've seen before. Is 10 years really soon enough to remake ""The Matrix"" (with Ellen Page as Neo)? Dennis Quaid in ""Dreamscape"" is far more entertaining. ""Videodrome"" is way more complex and intriguing, a movie that makes the viewer work.While the acting is fair enough for an action flick, there isn't much to say about the movie at all. It's pretty 1-dimensional and quite dumb. What really irks me is the fact that I was told repeatedly about how this movie was so complex, complicated, hard to understand, etc. It's really not. It just uses a nonsensical plot device; that of layered dreaming, to try and outwit the audience. While completely ridiculous – isn't a dream within a dream just part of the same dream? – it's also not hard to grasp. Is the bar really that low? What would the audience that this bamboozled make of a movie like ""Primer"" which is one of the most complex movies ever devised. Even ""Mission Impossible"" had more plot twists and turns than this drivel.To be honest it was barely just okay. It was boring like a bus-ride through Nebraska. Your mind is the scene of the crime? I didn't see much of any crime - just some folks trying to get a guy to change his mind. Big deal. Michael Caine is even becoming a Director's Trademark. His two minutes on-screen were gratuitous at best, certainly not a requirement to the story.So, to wrap up: boring, simple-minded, dumb, nonsensical plot with no 'science' and barely any 'fiction', less-than-average acting, annoying constant music while people are talking, convenient 'get-outs' when the logic of the story fails, which is frequently. Wow, I actually think I hate this movie.","

Because Nolan's History of Film making was what I was confident about. Memento, The Dark Knight are the two Movies which got a 10/10 and 9/10 rating from me respectively. But Inception, It was neither Memento, Nor The Dark Knight. It was more of a screenplay forcing you to believe it and to make it look genuine BUT with flawed ways and formulaic techniques which didn't work for me.Other than that it was fine. Visuals, Performances, Editing were all fine and the Camera Used for the movie was not the perfect choice. Direction as usual was POWERFUL but it was the story that didn't really appealed me.It is a movie with fine content but a forcing (in a wrong way) story. 6/10.

"mollyshelhamer","18 November 2021","Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" (2010) is a complex science fiction thriller about a group of people with varying specific skills that create a perfect team of dream-sharers. Dom Cobb, the main protagonist, is an extractor who is able to find out people's secrets by intruding into their dreams. His right-hand is Arthur, who researches and plans what they are trying to accomplish in a dream. Bright graduate student Ariadne is the architect for the dreams, meaning she literally constructs the physical aspects of a dreamscape. Eames is a professional at turning into anyone else in a dream, almost like shapeshifting. Lastly, Yusuf is a chemist who creates perfect concoctions of sedatives to achieve ideal conditions for the dreams to take place. This elaborate combination of characters is asked by a rich businessman, Saito, to infiltrate his dying competitor's son, Robert Fischer's, dream and place an idea in his mind so that Saito's business can become more successful. Traveling through the layers of someone's mind and making them think of an idea on their own is what they call ""inception."" Cobb is dedicated to making this happen so that Saito can arrange for Cobb's return to America to see his children. Without Saito, Cobb would not be able to return to America because of his alleged criminal background, but Saito has connections and power to clear his name. Some members of his team think achieving inception is impossible, but Cobb convinces them to be on board and they must come up with a mastermind plan with no room for error to achieve this extremely difficult yet imperative task. They begin a three-layer plan that involves elaborate depths of the dream dimension, taking advantage of Fischer's sensitive and dysfunctional relationship with his father, practiced methods of leaving a dream and entering the next, all while trying to avoid Cobb's wife Mal who lives in his subconscious and often sabotages his plans. The shocking ending leaves viewers at a cliffhanger and fans theorizing.Now that I've gone over the plot, let's talk about the other components of the film. The marketing strategies did an excellent job gathering hype for the film. The movie poster features the famous actors that everyone was excited to see, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Elliot Page, and the rest of the dream crew. It also says ""Inception"" in a large red font and notes that is directed by the same director of ""Dark Knight,"" which was an insanely successful and highly rated movie that was premiered two years prior to Inception. Dark Knight scored a 94% on rotten tomatoes and is #112 on IMBD's most popular movie list. This likely drew in the audience from Christopher Nolan's movies and set a high expectation for the quality of Inception. Another great marketing move was the contents of the teaser trailer. The trailer features a brief voiceover of Leonardo DiCaprio and amazing scenes with impressive cinematography taken out of context that show the viewers the production value and exciting action contents of the film all while confusing them so that they go see the film when it is released. I think the shock factor and science fiction aspect of the trailer is owed to the scene where a city block starts to fold over top of itself.The content of the film stayed true to the marketing because the cinematography, directing, and acting is quite well-done. Starting with the cinematography, the zero gravity scenes and cityscape building from the ground up were very realistic looking and intensified the movie watching experience. There was a lot of attention to detail. The directing of Inception is very montage based. It draws amounts and amounts of suspense. For example, the montage near the end of the film with the van, the fortress, and the hotel was painfully long but created such thick suspense. For the acting, I only have compliments and no complaints. Inception was casted beautifully and everyone fit their roles perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job as Dom Cobb, especially in the emotional scene with his wife and two kids in one of the dreams. My personal favorite performance was Cillian Murphy's role as Robert Fischer. He played as his character really well and he captured his relatively constant sadness surrounding his father situation.Inception is a staple film in the science fiction genre and is similar to a few other sci-fi movies as well. Inception is at #135 on IMBD's most popular movie list and has a rating of 87% on rotten tomatoes, so there is no doubt about its quality. In my opinion, Inception is pretty similar to the well-loved movie ""The Matrix"" (1999) starring Keanu Reeves. They are both iconic science fiction and action films with themes of alternate realities. The second film I think is very similar is a more recent film, Tenet (2020) with Robert Pattinson. Tenet is also about bending the rules of science and is also directed by Christopher Nolan. If you enjoyed either of these movies, I recommend Inception. I also recommend it to general fans of Christopher Nolan's directing, so if you have watched and enjoyed any of his films, you would probably like Inception too.On my rating scale of one to five, with one being the worst possible score and five being perfect, I give Inception a five. It has no weaknesses in my opinion. Every aspect of this movie combines into perfection. The acting and cinematography is what takes it over the top, and I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy in all of the roles they play. This is a movie I have voluntarily watched multiple times and it only gets better with each watch. It is very complex and a complete experience to view. My favorite aspect of the film is the ending. Many people say they hate cliffhangers, but I enjoy them because it leaves it up to the audience to imagine. Basically, you can choose your own ending based on what you think makes the most sense with the facts you are given in the film.","

So folks, don't believe the hype about this thing being a fascinating and revolutionary piece of art, because IT'S NOT. It's just another Hollywood commodity out to make big bucks. If you want some enlightening psychology read ""?"" and don't watch this, for ***ck's sake.There are some really cool effects to this film, but the story is so convoluted that it detracts away from the story.","

"springsunnywinter","19 August 2010","Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors and Memento & The Dark Knight are my favourite movies but for the first time I am disappointed with his movie Inception. The film is all about is all about stealing & planting ideas in people's mind by using their dreams.The idea of the movie is good but the bad screenplay, 2.5 hours length that drags really badly, plot holes & unanswered questions & Cobb's annoying wife ruined the whole movie.Inception is supposed to be a movie that requires multiple views to understand it like Memento but there is no way I will watch it again for the second time because it wasn't that confusing and it boring throughout. The dream sequences were not dreamlike and only the hotel dream looked cool. Cobb's wife was so annoying that I wanted to pull my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. There were so many unanswered questions like what year is the movie set in? Why does Cobb steal ideas and now he has to plant one? It was 2.5 hours long and they still couldn't explain anything.Inception isn't even original it is ripped off from a Japanese animated movie called ""Paprika"" which was out in 2006.I don't know why it is #3 on the IMDb top 250 it is not a visionary masterpiece or anything and it is only about 80% on rotten tomatoes and there are many great movies with 90+% on rotten tomatoes and they are not on the top 250 like Run Lola Run.It is nothing but an over hyped movie and the film makers must of written that ""Inception is good"" on a piece of paper and planted it in people's mind although it's not.","

"3xHCCH","15 July 2010","What drew me to watch this film on the very first day of theatrical showing was the cast, which was an incredible array of some of the most intense actors in Hollywood today. We have Ken Watanabe, Cilian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Michael Caine, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwait, and in the lead, none other than Leonardo di Caprio. The director and writer Christopher Nolan also comes with a very impressive oeuvre behind him, with ""Memento,"" ""The Prestige,"" and most recently, ""The Dark Knight.""This film is one of the most complicated films I have seen. A fair summary is almost impossible to put into words. It is challenging to follow all the jumping into and out of dreams, in dreams within dreams. I won't be surprised if you do not completely understand everything that was going on by the end. However, the visual experience of being in this multi-layered dream world is unmatchable in any recent films.I thought of ""The Matrix,"" and even Leo's latest (excellent) work ""Shutter Island,"" as this film proceeds to disorient you about what is and is not reality. However, ""Inception"" goes several levels higher in the hierarchy of convolutions in film. There are at least four levels of simultaneous dream upon dream happening at one time at one point. Amazing film editing work!Then there are technical aspects which were mind-boggling indeed, as Nolan's bizarre script required. The audience is brought inside buildings, rooms, elevators, even entire cities where you lose the sense of space, time, gravity and logic. It is a dream world--you need to see it to fully appreciate what I just wrote. The musical score of Hans Zimmer was strong and dramatic. These are definitely contenders by Oscar time.This film is not for everyone. There are those who would dismiss this as impossibly pretentious and pointless. But for me, ""Inception"" was very stimulating and challenging -- a film well-worthy to spend two and a half hours of our valuable time. Be ready to face this challenge when you go watch it. I won't be surprised if you feel you need to watch it all over again.","

"hot_action_ninja","8 December 2010","If there was ever a film to label as ""overrated"", it would be The Dark Knight. If there was ever another film to label as ""overrated"", it would be Inception. I just don't understand what it is about Christopher Nolan's films but they have the tendency to receive large amounts of unwarranted and undeserved praise.While they are very well-made films, they are for the most part nothing more than entertaining popcorn flicks (Memento being the one exception). Popcorn flicks of the up-most quality but nothing truly memorable or deep. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, lets get on with the review.Now, basically, Inception is a heist film with a twist. The heists take place inside of a dream, thus allowing for some creative and tricky special effects to be pulled off. These effects are pretty amusing to watch, most notably a scene where the gravity of a hallway is shifting and the two actors are duking it out amidst the gravity shifts, and this makes for some impressive-looking chaos.The story while somewhat original, wasn't pulled off as smoothly as it could have been in my opinion. There were just far too many plot holes that you could drive a tank through. Now with a certain proper ending, these plot holes would diminish, but Nolan has yet to confirm just what the ending means so the plot holes are left intact. If you want a better idea of what I mean by that, PM me.Acting for the most part is good and gets the job done. Just don't expect anything Oscar-caliber here. If there was one stand-out performance in Inception, I would definitely say it's from Leo Dicaprio. The guy proves time and time again that he's one of the better young actors working right now. The rest of the cast gives passable performances, but nothing special. Michael Caine is wasted, and I feel the only reason he was hired was to get his name on the box.Not much needs to be said about the special effects. They're some of the best yet, and at times even creative. Possibly the strongest aspect of the film, next to the effects, is the musical score. Inception has one of the best scores in recent memory. My hat is off to Hans Zimmer. The effects, score, and flawed but intriguing story come together in making Inception a very enjoyable and entertaining film. It's definitely smarter than your average popcorn flick, but at the end of the day it's still just a popcorn flick. Nothing more, nothing less. It lacks the emotional punch and attention to detail that made District 9 so great (now that's a true masterpiece, and one of the greatest sci fi films ever made).I give Inception 7.5/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun film that will also make them think a little bit.","

"mirwais-orbit","19 December 2010","OK, Inception can be the best rated movie of 2010, but not for me. I'm not questioning its quality as an action movie but yes as a sci-fi production because after The Matrix this movie seems much more illogical exactly for trying to be more realistic and fully coherent and cohesive. Also, it's impossible not compare it to The Matrix as Christopher Nolan already stated that the idea for the movie came from movies like The Matrix, The 13th Floor and The Dark City. That's so inspired by these movies - mainly The Matrix - that some references to it are a lot clear: the red and blue button in the briefcase (like the red and blue pill), the architect, a group which each one of them has an specific ability, the idea (meaning the virus), the dream soldiers (as the anti-virus), the totem (like the telephone), among others...Who pays attention to dreams or is familiar to the basics of it knows that the movie is right in some points but lacks of several other characteristics. When you're in a lucid dream you're able to control it and direct events and happenings, that's why you're able do dream a lucid dream and back to it even if you wake up for a short time. In unconscious dream you're unable to control it, that's why we mostly wake up when we die or when we fall, because in a lucid dream you're able to 'defend' yourself as you wish. The world of unconscious dream, where most of the film tries to reproduce as the characters are in a pre-coma state, is a lot more confusing and chaotic than it seems. It could have been much more explored if wasn't given so much attention for action sequences. The only time where seems like a real and chaotic dream is when a train crosses an entire street. At that moment I thought that things would be visually interesting, but it never was.Trying to give more attention for the action and not for science, the characters have a magic pack that connects several people into a dreamer's dream without reason. In The Matrix they have those huge machines that are connected in their minds to fully transfer people to a dream world previously built, making 2 or more people share the same dream space. That makes The Matrix more acceptable in this explanation than Inception. Scientists believe that sharing a dream is possible as the brain is moved by electric impulses, so, if we have a main board able to unify and decode those electric impulses, this could be possible. But in Inception what really connects them all? Just a powerful sedative? Are they super heroes or what? That's why I think that The Matrix is much more successful when exploring this idea, because it starts from a solid scientific one.While The Matrix deals with an electronic generated world, in Inception we are talking about a dream where there are cities, people, mobiles that works, explosives, car crashing, people dying and bleeding and whatever... but never the power of imagination. Work about the inception of an idea is a great plot, and the barriers for that could be anything than just a bunch of armored guys shooting and exploding everything.Inception for me is just a redone idea, the same as Avatar is to Pochahontas, but Inception doesn't give me anything new or add something interesting among other interesting ones I've seen before. The media calls it one of the best movies of 2010 and one of the best sci-fi movies of the time and that actually insults my intelligence because there's nothing new there. But the industry needs to make money from something times to times and they found Inception a great money machine. Technically the movie is superb and a great action flick, but I don't see anything more from it.I give 5 stars just as an action movie, because thinking as a sci-fi, I give it none. There's a lot for nothing... or maybe, a lot for just in the end the movie explains that incept an idea is so difficult as I trying to convince you that this movie isn't so good as it seems.","

"mrcibubur","28 October 2010","I had waited to see this movie on a decent copy DVD and missed it at the cinema. It was a very hyped movie on its release and I like De Caprios movies on the whole including the recent Shutter Island which surely does have some psychological connection with this movie in'playing with our minds'. But I liked and followed Shutter Island, I couldn't really follow 'Inception' and as a native Englishman, I am still unsure as to the meaning of the word 'Inception' for the context of the film.The film is only mildly engaging, tries to be intelligent and smart but fails dismally. There is no lack of action but this is 'not' Bourne Supremacy' or 'Salt' and things happened so haphazardly and quickly in the actions scenes that it completely bored the pants off me when watching the movie because I was trying to follow the story of the film and couldn't, so I became frustrated.Leonardo is a great actor and acts well, true enough and I love Ellen Page after Juno and even Peacock - but this film was definitely not for her and Michael Caine had a minor cameo role as Miles the Father figure for Leonardos character. As for Mal played by Marion Couthillard, oh dear, what a shambles! This is one of those films which will be quickly forgotten and barely remembered in Leonardos repertoire. The concept of the film is indeed a good and innovative one and I kept thinking of movies like 'The Matrix' while watching it. Why oh why did the director have to 'overcook' this movie.We watch movies to be entertained. Like Iron Man 2, if you like movies with abundant action and little reality, go ahead, watch this movie and rave about it but for me, it is a major disappointment, not with the mainstream acting and the story but with the end result through directing and production. My feeling is that it was shoddy.Not a movie to review a second time or recommend to friends to see, sorry!","

"pefrss","23 July 2010","I am beating myself up because I fell for the hype. Unfortunately I spend money on that nightmare, next time I go to a movie which has been so hyped I make sure it is a free screening. It is a nightmare. If you have these kinds of dreams you are a deeply disturbed person. Shooting, car crashes, explosions, shootings, car crashes, explosions that is all that troubled soul dreams about. I usually do not go to movies consisting of shootings, explosions, car crashes and crumbling buildings. Only when I really feel that a movie gives a realistic rendering of war will I go and see such a movie because I am trying to understand that part of human nature. But I went. It was hot and I thought it would be nice to sit in a cool movie theater. Well first the movie theater was warm and I had to fight to stay awake , then they switched the air-conditioning on high and we all got frozen. I was hanging in checking my watch every three minutes and hoping that eventually I would see that great movie people were raving about. Nothing. After 148 painful and boring minutes I tried to getup and leave but was frozen stiff and it took me a few seconds to get moving. The credits had just started rolling but the movie theater was already empty, obviously everybody could not wait to leave. There were only a few people anyway in the afternoon show. This was my first movie in eight months because there was absolutely nothing worthwhile seeing in the theaters nearby. I love to go to the movies and I love the big screen so when the ticket lady asked me if I wanted XP I said yes. I was disappointed by that too. Not worth the money. Hopefully there will some movie I want to see in the coming months, otherwise I will stick to books.","

"Victor_Fallon","1 November 2010","I wanted to like Inception because I think most of the people involved are talented, but it is just an endless exposition of the ever-changing 'rules' of the dreamworld. It's a shame. It isn't confusing, but it is very boring. There are no engaging characters and it has no trace of humour. It does have some good performances and... nope, that's it.It's not a terrible film, it's just very very dull. When all rules are taken away, it would be nice to see some genuine imagination - not a few FX set-pieces which don't, even at a most basic level, do anything to help the wafer-thin story, You know what this is like? It's like reading a dream diary - a fragmented collection of somebody else's ultimately vapid ideas. It's worth watching once to say ""Was that it?"" and shrug.Watch Mr Nobody instead.

"mikealike","1 November 2010","Call me ""dumb"", I do not care, because I have my own mind and experience and I know by now that I am not. My only reserve is that maybe I should see it twice, or that this is not the moment for me to have seen it( As is with reading books, today one can't stand it , tomorrow it makes perfect sense). Apart from this, a movie being an experience destined to consume itself at the maximum in one ""kick"", after this Inception experience, I feel that something is really missing here. What is the idea of this movie? What is it trying to express? In what system of beliefs is all this taking place? Because, apart from the famous cast, the good performances, the special effects that are everywhere and the incessant and disturbing gun noises, I do not see what am I supposed to get enriched with through watching this movie? OK, the idea of conscious dreaming is centuries-old, so is the idea of ""staging"" the life or the universe(no need to mention the link to Matrix, etc), but who would be the ""dreamer"" if we extrapolated to our lives? Because the thought of a world meant just for corporations and ""important"" individuals, I do not like. So, in a person's life, any person, how are the Inception ideas fitting in? Are we to look and see who ""dreams"" for us, and the movie couldn't put this idea bluntly? Are we dealing with an explanation for wave function collapse, controlled consciously by some skilled to do so and implementing during our sleep? I feel the need to say, ""please explain yourself"". One cannot mount such a giant of a movie (publicity, effects, cast and so), and in the end leave you with a bigger blur than before such ideas occurred. I would say it is either a case of snobbish commercialism that is not backed up by enough understanding and research, or a case of intricate mind and ideas that have no clarity in expressing themselves. It is an exercise for the brain, I give it that. But in the light of too much gratuitous violence, too less contoured universe of the movie, too crowded action, too soapy emotional effects (the passed away wife, the uncommunicative rich father) and too high praise that it deserves (c'mon, this is the new Matrix? Are we going back as the time goes by?, I feel deeply not pleased.","

"antileft","2 August 2010","This is ,unfortunately, a cinematic catastrophe, and all my expectations that I might have had before like this being the most original film of the year that might open a new page in the sci-fi genre, proved completely and utterly misconceived, to say the least. This is simply the most overrated film after Nolan's Dark Knight, supposedly intended to represent a pinnacle of intellectualism, originality, and ideas never before even hinted at. But, all in all, this is nothing but two and a half hours of utter and sheer nonsense, a real viewing terror, a debasement of a genre! It is in the limitless realm of quasi-Freudian, or is it Yungian ?, philosophy, e.g., a dream fixing, and the main actors are faced with a difficult task of deciphering the way to create the dream within the dream within the dream, and when you expect to see some true scary Freudian elements or dream symbolisms of destruction and, God Forbid, sex, no, you are left in the cold with your feet dangling in the aforementioned 'within loops', as sexuality, as we all know, is the source of all the modern evils, and as this film is intended for all and sundry, e.g. like a pleasant, 'wellness ' relaxation after a really exhausting 3-hour shopping spree, the family must let some steam off in the nearby cinema, and ,voila, Inception is here with a correctly calibrated dose of illogical shooting and explosions ( at least I got to see the technology and weapons the Alpine units today use ), and ,yes, not only DiCaprio survives , everybody else fares the same, so have no fear, Nolan is here! But, the damn time, it just won't follow the film's logic, 140 minutes is a heck of a time to kill the boiling fury over this total waste of money, time and personal dignity. Thank God for Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien series and a million other films. Crisis in the screenplay department has really surpassed the worst personal expectations, now even the illiterate are writing  Just horrible","

Why were things happening on the screen? And, why for so long? That last never-ending sequence on ice. Had no idea who was doing what and why.I did understand the concept as I was prepared for it after hearing from so many people about the 'complex' script. But to me, it was plain stupid. The producers had money and wanted to use it in action sequence and special effects. Did those fit the plot? Not really. This movie didn't need much action, to be honest. The movie should have stimulated our brains, not ear drums.Anyway I went because of the hype. Should have known better. But then, it was a dollar theater and Sunday night when Texas Rangers and Steelers both were losing. So, it was OK.","

The ending was the most obvious outcome it could be, you already know he doesn't except the dream version of his wife so she would be gone. But the kidsgetting home to see their faces again, they were the real focus. If you missed that in the beginning then seeing his father-in-law pick him up at the airport should have been the final tip off.Most people I ask about that missed it all; they couldn't even tell which dream was which. I think that's what scares me the most, people think this takes real intelligence to follow.Maybe if your attention deficitOh wait I am and I still had no trouble following this over rated boring movie.I gave this movie 4 out of 10 stars for special effects only, for story line and acting I give it only 2 stars","

"ThatAnimeSnob","19 March 2013","Good points. Well, the visuals were great that's for sure. The way they bent reality and had rooms spin and cities shift and stuff blow up, sure, great action. The soundtrack is good as well but it doesn't have any memorable tunes.Bad points. What the hell was that action all about? Projections of someone's mind were typical people attacking the incerptors. Am I to believe that the ultimate defense a person's mind has is... faceless mooks? Where are the dragons, the supermen, the giant robots? Something that is NOT faceless mooks? If this is the realm of dreams then it should be filled with such stuff, there is no holding back. Not even the most pragmatic mind would be without such stuff. So here I am watching an hour long action scene that is better fit for a James Bond film (minus the rotating rooms) than an adventure in the subconscious mind of troubled men. Makes little sense. Then the dialogues. Although the explanations around how the inception works were great and I did understand the concept, I found that it took a huge chunk of the duration. Half of the dialogues feel like the characters are indirectly explaining the theory to us. Something that they wouldn't since they are supposed to know such stuff and have no need to mention them.Good point. The story is indeed interesting and offers a concept around the blurring of reality that has never been offered exactly like this before.Bad point. The actual plot outside the interesting concept is mostly thrown away at shoot outs and explosions with random mooks that have nothing to do with a person's mind. If I dream something, I am the dream. Everyone is me, everyone acts like me, everything reacts like me. Yet the movie wants us to think our dream is like reality. I was not convinced that a dreamworld is so stiff. It was changing all right but the moment someone knows he is dreaming and doesn't wake up, he doesn't need to run or hide. He can mold everything where he stands and play it God. Thus the movie doesn't literally show how dreams work. It just gives you some nice ideas and wastes the rest in action scenes you can find even in a normal action movie.Acting... no good or bad points here. There are no prevailing characters for all I care. The idea and the action overshadow the actors. Di Caprio and the gang did their parts well but I still find it hard to believe that such an unstable personality that has his murderous wife chasing him in dreams would be allowed to go on in such delicate missions. It's like inviting Freddy Krugger to chop you to pieces while the world hangs at the edge of the cliff. Bad plot element.So is this movie good? In theory, yes. Action lovers and eggheads will love it. Scriptwritters may get some nice ideas from. But as far as I care it is NOT a masterpiece. It has too many convenient events, too much holding back, too much infodump, too much out-of place action.Things that I would change to make this movie better: -No shootings with faceless mooks and blowing stuff just for the heck of it. -More dream morphing scenes in places of fore-mentioned pointless action. -Less infodump. -Less corny dead wife drama. We have Solaris for that.The Cage is a movie doing a rather better portrait of a man's dreamworld. Not so much mambo jumbo around how it works but shows it better. And of course there is Solaris (dead wife thing) and Matrix (cool action) and James Bond (shooting and blowing stuff) to take out most other good parts of the movie. By the end of it, only the idea of inception is what stands out. And it wasn't exploited that much really.","

"SilverDiamond1987","9 August 2011","Where should I start? It would be better to get straight to the point. Firstly, despite the idea is brilliant, in other words, generally the story of the movie is brilliant, ideas don't make a movie great as just complicatedness doesn't make a movie good. By this movie, personally, I have understood that Nolan is not ""my director"". The Dark Knight was also a serious disappointment for me and Batman Begins was just a summer blockbuster (Following and Prestige were very very good) As for Inception, the biggest flaw of the movie is the movie is lack of heart and soul, in other words, it is cold. The characters are cold, the atmosphere is cold, the reactions are cold, because they are in dream? Well, I don't think so. It causes what then? I didn't much care about the intrigue, couldn't identify with the characters, so the most important problem of the movie is its dramatic structure. The second is the ""dreams"" itself. You know, the agent of dreams in cinema is David Lynch. Why? Because he shoots creative, intriguing, sometimes meaningless as it should be and surreal dream sequences. The dream sequences in Inception can only impress the architects, mathematicians and some businessmen (because there are a lot of men in black suit) It is because like his approach towards Batman, he sticks to reality. Despite the visual effects are jaw dropping, ""the street bending"" scene is my favorite, it doesn't help much. By the way, honestly, I couldn't understand the trick of Ariadne, for example, is it planned or impromptu? If the point is impressiveness, well I was much more impressed by Sucker Punch for example which has been exposed to harsh reviews. The movie also has not any dramatic twist, epic scene (except for a few moments) or real mystery which had been all necessary in my opinion. Can we say that the movie was low key? Thirdly, some, may be many action scenes seem pointless and ineffective. Especially the ""snow"" sequence. It was too long without real entertainment or excitement. There is not any problem with the cast (except the fact that in contrast with the majority, I think that Leonardo Di Caprio's performance in this movie was just good, not his best performance so far, it is nothing, for example in comparison with What's eating Gilbert Grape!), but it is a bit disappointing that Nolan often uses the same actors in his movies. A note: Michael Caine's character might be a tribute for his character in Children of Men. If you ask me, the best part of the movie is the ""train scene"" It was the only scene that I was dramatically involved and got excited. The ""gravity"" sequence was just interesting. I didn't find it epic. Finally, about the plot, I didn't find the starting point creative, brilliant or exciting. I mean the concept of choosing a businessman for inception, weren't there better options? In other words, the main story was too poor for the concept. However, if we consider Nolan's style, to tell a story about the world of business, might be exciting for him. However, if we consider the hype, the rating, the reviews etc. it seems that Mr. Nolan has deluded audiences again or we have been incepted.","

"claszdsburrogato","17 August 2023","Christopher Nolan is well known for his great films that are always remembered when talking about the best films in history, among them is Inception. But is it really that good? The script, direction and visual effects are almost perfect, with that, all the scenes are visually very beautiful. Several scenes are very remembered until today, in fact it is marked in your mind for a long time. In all aspects this film is great, so in fact all the positive points that are highlighted about this film are correct, but I do not believe it is a perfect film or close to it. Perhaps a big negative point is that at times it ends up being a little boring, not least because it is more than two hours of film. Even so, it is undeniable to say that this is an incredible film and perhaps in fact one of the best in history.","

In return for a new identity, which will allow him again to go to the States to be with his kids, Cobb is challenged to now plant an idea in someone's mind in stead of retrieving it.The premise of the film is rather silly but it's the execution that truly ruins the film. The major issue is without a doubt the exposition ridden dialog which didn't progress the overall plot or added anything in terms of character development. In stead we get the most expensive cast doing little else than yammer on and on about the totally uninteresting and far-fetched technical methods that are involved in dream infiltration as Nolan's showcases his unimaginative and clueless take on the Sci-Fi genre. In between these witless and thoroughly boring expositions, we get treated to the action clichés from every Bond movie that has ever graced the silver screen in the past 3 or 4 decades while the pounding soundtrack gets louder and louder simply with every subsequent scene.Where was the conflict in this story needed to create viewer involvement? Who exactly were we expected to root for? Why was everything happening in this film without exception utterly implausible? Why do people find this movie to be complex when the film spends about 95% of the script explaining what is going on. And why wasn't this hapless script nominated for a couple of Razzies?The fans are right, I don't get it.","

"nikitalinivenko","20 October 2019","The problem with Inception is that its execution doesn't fit its subject matter. This is supposed to be a movie about dreams...so where is the dream-like quality? It's not abstract, it's very cold and calculated - it's all to linear - a perfectly plotted beginning-middle-end story; ffs, even the dreams have rules! Since when do dreams have rules? Or even a through-line? It's not a murky shade, it's just cold mechanical computer-generated imagery like all Hollywood productions. This might be how robots dream in binary, but not the ungraspable mystique of how organisms dream, something that the likes of Tarkovsky, Bergman or early practical films conjured up both movingly and authentically, and at times down-right creepily. Nolan's clockwork extravaganza is as devoid of personality as the man himself. To look into one's dreams would be intimate - Nolan eschews intimacy for spectacle generated by 1's and 0's.","

I do not understand the hype surrounding this film, probably the fruit of the market campaign of smart producers that lure naive viewers that seem that does not think and understand how flawed and stupid this story is. The plot is developed in fast pace to force the viewer to not think, with incoherent rules that do no make sense and that change in each layer of the dream in accordance with the intention of the writer.

"ferdinand1932","28 May 2011","While it seems ingenious to invent a cunning conceit such as the one deployed in this film it is like a novel that uses neologisms and errant grammar and punctuation: it's effects tire and it seems less than it wishes it to be.The dramaturgy and logic of Inception is very simple and relies on a 'reductio' argument which is quite clear within 10 minutes,(and is absurd because of the logical impossibility of the argument itself like Wittgenstein's proof against skepticism) but it's true failing is not that: it is in fact the use of change and sudden effects as plot devices because once employed they heighten awe but kill any suspense or connection with the characters in the film. There is no reason or emotion in caring about characters that are chaff in a rather ordinary logician's game.Years ago Thomas Pynchon was considered an important writer, and the author and critic (and sometime film critic) Peter Ackroyd wrote an astute review of his major work, ""Gravity's Rainbow"", in which he ridiculed the ease of such writing; it's deceptive cleverness; it's egoism, and its immaturity because it is so overtly obvious, and like anything childish, of no real lasting interest artistically. Inception is that too. Instantly forgettable.","

Plenty of these in re-runs of the A-Team...All this messing about in the hotel, fighting guards, tying up bodies and moving them around. These guys aren't very creative / resourceful in their dreams, are they? However attractive Marion Cotillard is, the sub plot became very irritating indeed. The grenade launcher should have been used on her early in the dream! As for the end, an easy cop out: it's a dream, folks.I won't go into the cgi / scenery designs.

That main idea though, is something very unique and creative that is brought to life by outstanding filmmaking, everything you'd expect from a Christopher Nolan film. Writing and performances are also great across the board. The only problem with Inception is in ones own interpretation. Some may says it's pretentious and the ideas presented acctualy aren't fully understood by the creators and/or don't make sense. But I think that's a terrible angle to approach the film. It's Sci-Fi, you're not supposed to over-anylasie it in that way. It's meant to plant thought provoking ideas in your head, which I beleive it does very well, not be a perfectly logical and plausible idea. Yes, it does have a few questionable sequences and scenarios, esspecally at the end, but it doesn't drag the rest of the movie down at all to me. It's a must watch","

"Christian_Dimartino","18 July 2010","Leonardo DiCaprio stars in the movie i've been waiting for for over a year, Inception. And to tell you the truth, it was worth the wait. I waited so long, without knowing what it was about, because I know that any film that Christopher Nolan, who directed my favorite film The Dark knight, will blow my mind. And he does it. With his new masterpiece, Nolan has made one of my top three favorite films of all time. I haven't loved a film more since The Dark knight. There hasn't been a mind blowingly original film since Memento. Coincidently, they are from the same director. Inception is one of the greatest movies ever made. It's the best film of the year, it is going to be overall. It is probably going to be the best film of the decade, and the decades to come.Now, how do I describe it? Dom Cobb(played by Leonardo Dicaprio) has the ability to enter a person's dreams and steal secrets from that. Him and his team(which includes Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Dileep Rao, and Tom Hardy) do that. Inception is when you plant an idea in somebody's head. Some of them believe it's a myth. Cobb knows it isn't though. He knows it exists. And that is what Cobb and his team try to do.There is more to the plot than that. There are things involving Cobb's wife Mal(played excellently by Marion Cotillard) and Robert Fischer Jr.(played by Cillian Murphey, another Nolan regular). But to tell you the truth, I can't exactly explain it. It's very complex, and too smart, and i'd be ashamed to explain this film.I'd be ashamed to explain it,because it's too brilliant. It took Christopher Nolan ten years to write it. I can see how. It took me over a year to see it. And it will probably take me more than once to understand it fully.There hasn't been a film that i've loved more since The Dark knight. Inception is on my top three favorite movies. It's the most original, emotionally complex,complex,emotional, visually exhilarating,brainy,and well shot motion picture in years.The ending is brilliant. Nolan has almost outdone himself. I would say it's almost as good as The Dark knight. I have loved all of Nolan's films. Inception, The Dark knight and The Prestige are all on my top five.Nolan has never shot a better film.This is his best thriller. It's like films like Vanilla sky but it blows them away. Though I liked that movie. Inception is the best movie of the year.It will remain the best movie of the year. It will most likely be my favorite film of the decade. and the decades to come. I guess that is until another Nolan movie comes out. Because he is a director that has a specialty in blowing our minds and outdoing himself.Inception is an amazing movie that will probably get better within repeated showings. You won't find a better film this Summer. Screw those Toy story 3 lovers(though I loved it too).Inception is fantastic.Inception:A+++++++","

"moviewizguy","16 July 2010","INCEPTION is a film in which you want to go in knowing nothing because it's best seen with no prior knowledge. So I'm just going to not say a word about the plot and have the film unfold in front of you, sometimes literally. It's pretty difficult to explain what INCEPTION really is because it's damn packed with so many interesting ideas. Really, when you come out of the theater, you'll only think, ""What did I just see?"" The film is filled with so much ambition and so many original ideas that it captivates you. In fact, I think this is the fastest 150 minute film I've ever seen because it felt like 80 minutes! I really wanted to see more when the credits rolled.Unfortunately, INCEPTION isn't a perfect film. It falls short on its ambition. Some ideas weren't as developed as I hope they would be and others weren't presented clear enough. In fact, it's as if the characters spoke in another type of jargon exclusively made for psychologists pursuing in the career of dreams. Also, the story isn't all that special. Another common complaint you might hear about the film is that the characters are flat. It's true. The film presents us with six or seven characters but does absolutely nothing with them. Leonardo DiCaprio's character is the only character that's fleshed out. In some cases, I didn't care for the characters when their lives were at stake.Still, the performances by the ensemble cast are really good. I enjoyed Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy in their roles a lot. I might not be the only person to notice this but I thought Leonardo DiCaprio played the exact same character as he did in SHUTTER ISLAND. I couldn't get past Ken Watanabe's thick accent. It was hard to understand him in many of his scenes. Marion Cotillard did a great job, though.The film is also visually intricate, if that makes sense and even that description doesn't give the film justice. Again, it's really hard to explain. The visual effects were really excellent along with the action scenes but don't expect this film to be filled with action. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer (AKA: One of the best composers ever) is fantastic, much like Zimmer's other soundtracks.Overall, INCEPTION is a flawed but seriously excellent film that presents some very, very, very interesting ideas. It's a wholly original film, which is great considering the amount of remakes, re-imaginings, sequels, prequels, etc. that we've gotten in the past few years, let alone this year. The characters could have been fleshed out a lot more. Still, I was absolutely engaged throughout by the story, and Christopher Nolan's ingenious script and direction just sucks you in. This is the perfect cure for this year's lackluster summer.","

"chadd firchau","10 December 2010","I like Christopher Nolan. He a good director. His little movie here, Inception, is one of those movies that give you brain burn. Allow me to explain! A rag tag team of handsome thieves invade people's dreams and extract memories. But for some reason implanting ideas in someone's head is super hard? No it's not! Hypnotist do it all the time. Then this Arthur character says ""The dreamer can always remember the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake."" Also, not true. People get source amnesia all the time. I'm sure you've met someone who claims to have invented a joke or a phrase that they actually heard from someone else. And these thieves are trying to get some wealthy hot-shot to shut down his bidnass? There's an easier way to do that that doesn't involve dream invasion. Wallstreet does it all the time. If some butt-wipe is getting too powerful, just bust him for any number of egregious crimes in which super wealthy billionaires inevitably get themselves involved. Or frame him and arrange some kind of take-over. 10000000000 times easier. Additionally, there are plenty of cheesy Hollywood shootouts where the bad guys can't aim, and cars function perfectly fine after being filled with bullet holes. You could say the cars still work cuz it's a dream, but then why do shot up people get totally screwed? I can overlook these ridiculous elements in a Jean Claude Van Damme movie by simply turning off my brain, but that's exactly where everything goes wrong in this movie. Ya see, if this was a comedy, everything in the story would work. But it isn't a comedy, is it, homies? heck no, son, it's a psychological thriller! So it's meant to stimulate your brain, but all the absurdities mentioned above ask you turn your brain off in order to enjoy it. So the constant turning on and off chafes your brain. Brain burn.","

"stensson","3 August 2010","I haven't got the faintest idea of what this is about. Perhaps something about controlling other people's dreams, to get what you want. In this case it's once again the evil corporation, which wants to rule the world. OK, great.In fact there is no plot or five running at the same time. You decide. You can see Paris upside down if you're interested, but really, the time when we got impressed by computer tricks is since long over.Together with all the quasi-intellectualism in the dialog, this is very hard to stand and not even entertaining. Something is wrong when you're bored already after two minutes and then, there are more than 140 minutes to go. A serious warning about this.","

"Snowgoat","26 July 2012","There is no doubt that Nolan is a very talented director, and I like a lot of his films, but sadly I think like a number of other hugely successful directors before him (Peter Jackson springs to mind) his success has led to a detrimental degree of freedom for him to churn out his own poorly-written scripts unchecked, and make films that are about an hour longer than they need to be. I know I'm swimming against the tide of public opinion here, but while I was hugely excited about seeing Inception back when it came out, I was absolutely crushed on first viewing. I found it terribly written (the film begins with enough exposition scenes to fill a normal film's running time!), incomprehensible (editing was all over the place, action dull and repetitive), visually disappointing (all the best bits were revealed in the trailer and were all contained in the exposition scenes rather than having anything to do with the story) and with a concept that just didn't hold water (the dream sequences seemed to always resemble Matrix out-takes and were held together by a logic that just wasn't very dream-like)!Perhaps if Nolan had a studio breathing down his neck and someone to revise his shaky script this could have turned out well, but after the success of TDK he can effectively write his own ticket and is (sadly) free to churn out this kind of lazy and self-indulgent snooze-fest. The same thing happened with Peter Jackson after LOTR with King Kong (an hour too long, too much freedom etc.)Hans Zimmer's incredible score was about the only positive I took out of Inception (Zimmer's brilliant scores are increasingly the glue that holds Nolan's films together and makes them seem better than they are). Despite his obvious talents and love of film (I love him for shooting Batman stuff in IMAX 70mm!) Nolan has some very bad habits (mainly relying on his and his brother's writing) which I think really hamper his films these days. I loved TDK, but it frustrates me in almost equal measure, and though I haven't seen The Dark Knight Rises yet, I will go in with very low expectations based on his apparently dwindling form.","

At that stage you know you're going to waste another 2 and a half hours watching the nonsense where people slip in and out of dreams in an attempt to fabricate a story where there was no story.The plot starts in the first few minutes and ends in the last few minutes, everything in between... well... is better left unwatched.If you haven't figured it out immediately, then chances are you won't by the time it's over, in which case you're also wasting 2 and a half hours of your time.The only thing I got from watching this horrible overrated bloated cinematic experiment was a wish to kill myself.

"agreaves-8-151592","23 March 2011","A visual Tour De Force that gets lost in its own complex world, Inception stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb; a rogue 'extractor' who steals elements of dreams and sells them to the highest bidder, all in the name of corporate espionage. But things start to go drastically wrong when Cobb takes on a seemingly impossible job and his dead wife turns up to make trouble.Ingenious but convoluted, Inception may not be to everyone's taste – but it is undoubtedly a Chris Nolan picture; the same man who gave us Memento, The Prestige and of course, The Dark Knight. The problem is that for all the slick visuals and clever narrative structures, we end up with something cold, clinical and frustratingly diffuse.Why Inception falters, and I appreciate that I may be in the minority, is that for such a surreal and imaginative concept to work, it requires an equally surreal and imaginative mind, and Nolan is just too conservative and too technical for the content. It might have made a more interesting film had it been directed by P.T Anderson or, dare I say it, Terry Gilliam.","

"nebukanezer","12 August 2010","I was on the verge of leaving the Cinema on this completely ridiculously story. I hung in there (also despite the insanely annoying music) though, and am simply shocked that the film has (currently) a top 3 position of movies ever made. Perhaps I have entered a (bad) dream and have not yet woken up...So the backdrop of the story is basically that a bunch of guys drug people and enter a dream world using a plastic box with wires attached to those entering the dream. In this dream they use the same technique (the box and drugs are now just apart of THIS dream..) to enter another dream. This process can be repeated a number of times - and in the movie they go to the fourth dream-layer. If you are killed while dreaming you will wake up - unless you are too heavily sedated (in real-life, or also in one of the dreams?..), which will then put you in a ""limbo"" state - which can potentially last for years. If you want to get out of a dream safely - you need to be ""kicked"" (sharp acceleration) in the dream-layer above the one you are currently in. If you are unsure if you are dreaming or not, you have a ""totem"" (a physical object that for some unspecified reason behaves differently in a dream - why?) that you can examine.I just hate it. Simply hate it...The only good thing I see in this movie is the ending: DiCaprio sees his kids again - but they look exactly as they have done in his dreams - they have not aged at all. This means that he is still dreaming and he is therefore stuck in a new limbo dream world - and will be there for a LONG time. Phew... that means there won't be a sequel until he wakes up again. Unless it is me that's still dreaming.","

"JRmf","10 December 2010","Not many movies rate a 9/10, especially when averaged over almost a quarter of a million votes. So - devoted Sci-fi freak that I am (and being so often disappointed by cheap SF offerings), I was sure I was on a winner.However after viewing the movie last night, I found it confusing and inconclusive. I understand the basic concept, that by entering a person's subconscious, it might be possible to steal or implant information / thoughts, without the subject later being aware - ""It was all a dream"".However in the main phase of the movie, where Cobb (DiCaprio) is tasked by Saito (Watanabe) with implanting Fischer (Murphy) with an idea which will neutralise his rival, the end of the matter seems to be that Fischer, who always thought his Dad regarded his as a loser (""a disappointment"") in fact simply wanted him to be himself i.e. to realise his own potential. Surely this would be empowering rather than diminishing or defeating, as Saito wanted.The intrusion of Dom's wife Mal and kids into many scenes was an excessive distraction which seemed to get the movie too far from what was supposed to be happening. Interesting idea, that they'd already spent some 50 years together in a deep dream layer .. but a bit too far-fetched. Real dreamstates are certainly tinged with reality, but not the concrete reality expressed in the movie. Only when Dom enters his own world towards the end of the movie, do we see skyscrapers which look like plain cardboard boxes. It would have been unacceptable to audiences if the ""dream invaders"" had entered a more cloudy reality (the old idea of Heaven) as is commonly experienced in dreams.I notice many reviewers who gave the movie a 9 or 10/10 say it must be viewed multiple times in order to be fully understood. Is this really the mark of a good movie these days, it must be studied like a high school text? I greatly prefer Spielberg's method of storytelling - complex and very entertaining but comprehensible in one sitting.And what's with all the gunfire? I understand that subjects can be psychologically prepared to resist extraction or perhaps implantation, but much of the gunplay seemed gratuitous, simply there for audiences expected as some sort of crowd-pleaser.The CGI and cinematography is first rate, but nothing really compensates if the basic story is not comprehensible.Well it's a movie I will certainly keep in my SF collection, and no doubt I will watch it at least once more to try and see what others find so appealing. 6/10","

"Minerva_Meybridge","9 October 2011","I was trying my best to keep from falling asleep. What purports to be a breakthrough film about dreams, turned out to be a first-rate, high-budget snooze fest. The writer couldn't decide, I suppose, whether he wanted to do a James Bond movie or the Matrix or the Thirteen Floor. Leo Dicapprio's character is insipid. Ellen Page's character is two sentences short of a paragraph. Everyone else was unmemorable. I couldn't care less if anyone lived or died. Nothing really made much sense. And don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the Thirteenth Floor and the Matrix (though the sequels were blech!). Christopher Nolan did a great job with Memento and Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, but OMG, what was everyone thinking? Apparently, I, too, am in a nightmare, looking at the great reviews. And while the special effects were eye-catching, they were not mind boggling. Two clenched fists for this one. Methinks now, I'll just go and watch Green Lantern and do myself in.","

"adrean-819-339098","15 August 2010","For a film that deals in the world of dreams this film lacks a lot of imagination. I think that in being a Hollywood blockbuster it had to tick a certain amount of boxes that are necessary for the monumental amounts of money that are thrown at it.The first 30 minutes I was interested by the concept and the pacing of the film. The concept of espionage within a dream is an interesting enough concept. I was very open and excited by the idea of going into the world of dreams with the characters. I wish they could have perhaps explored a little more and pushed the boundaries of the dreams. It seemed that time and space flowed a little too seamlessly. Perhaps Kafka's 'The Trial' or a more Cronenberg style would have helped.After the first 30 minutes it sunk into the normal plodding of a Hollywood blockbuster. Are we watching Mission Impossible or a film about dreams? Unfortunately the last two thirds of the film were more Mission Impossible. I couldn't help thinking of the could have beens. All I remember is a van falling for two hours, some irrelevant action scenes in the tundra, and an in-durable no gravity scene which had me yawning.Oh and am I the only one who cannot stand Marion Coutillard?","

"adrongardner","18 July 2010","Great ideas grow like a cancer. Sometimes you never really know where they come from.Chris Nolan has never really had a totally original idea. Like Tarantino, he knows other movies so well, their ideas creep into his work, either intentionally or not. While my words on originality may come as inflammatory, my feeling toward his talent, and films is quite the opposite. He's good - real good. But he isn't original. Nobody is. This is the 21st century folks and its all been done. It is the way he's showing us these familiar things, that keeps us coming back.Except for Di Caprio, who never really convinces as a brooding widower/father, the rest of the band is perfect. Not that any of them are actually interesting, the plot is the real character in Inception. Hans Zimmers score is majestic and hugely epic and Wally Pfister's familiar clean visuals make it easy on the eyes.Much like a new roller-coaster at 6 Flags, Inception is a ride we've been on on before. Dreams, reality and all that jazz, but this one has a deeper dose of rabbit hole. We have a heist film set in the frame of corporate psychological espionage - whatever the hell that is.We get Matrix style pseudo reality and weightless gun fights. We get The Game and Total Recall style onion layers. We get the old man in the bedroom of cubist proportions from the Kubrick 2001 finale. Maybe one too many James Bond ski battles. And I'm just getting warmed up. The wife story rings hollow - in fact, it's downright boring. Exposition goes in circles and we never do get enough Watanabe Ken. But it's that layered time of the tiered dreams that makes this one go boom. The elevator that can't drop and that van that just falls forever with the cameras over cranking at 150 frames per second or more. But we don't want it to hit the water. Go deeper Cobb, cause I don't want to get off this one yet. The final joke with the unending spinner? This is Nolan's dream, not Cobb's.It's not visionary, it's not original, but just like the meandering Dark Knight or the wretched nonsense of the Prestige, or the titanic plot holes of Memento, Inception is a rabbit hole that owns you til it's over. This ain't art or philosophy to ride to the top. It's just one great kick all the way down.8/10","

"vlevensonnd-1","19 December 2010","It was a pretty good movie, however, when I am able to predict the twists and turns that are going to be taken - and in the first 15 minutes of watching the movie - the movie automatically gets a lower score with me. I cannot count how many of these movies are being made, and most of them are using the same repetitive path - what you think is reality isn't - the one who's in charge - or 'In the know' is the one who's psycho, schizophrenic, or mentally unstable. I was surprised that after Leo did Shutter Island, that he'd just turn around and do the same kind of movie. (For those who didn't notice - the top kept spinning in the end shot - meaning he was dreaming - not actually awake - which means he was the one all along who was in err). The acting was a bit over the top and not convincing enough. The script wasn't that great, and I already can visualize certain types of people making attempts to practice this sort of thing. Among those 'certain types' you will also find hoards of conversations about 'lucid dreaming' and 'out of body experience', huge attractions to witchcraft, Harry Potter, etc, 'reality' shows, trash TV, RPG's and other games - basically - a lot of fantasy and unreality type of attractions. This movie will be a cult classic to them, maybe even their bible. The good thing about this movie does indeed need to be noted, however. We are living in an unreality & fantasy based society and it's ever growing. This movie shows the dangers of living in in that kind of mode, where a person starts getting more and more confused about what is real and what isn't. I ended up fast forwarding through quite a bit. It's getting a total score of 9??? Up for awards??? Com'on people. There's no logic why this movie is getting these kind of ratings.","

(like when the girl gets dragged a...way! OMG never laughed so much in my life b4!) . It was a ridiculous waste of resources that could have been put towards ... I dunno folding socks? How they managed to make it so ""popular"" I do not know.It was pretentious more than anything. It had this strange, ""this is the best film of all time because we folded a street over"" vibe to it. It was nothing but special effects which i must say were nice but the actual story itself was perpetuated with unspecified technology, chemicals, rules and really bad acting from some really good actors! When you watch a film of this caliber and I use the term lightly, you should be entertained, not bored and scared. They told the story in less than five minutes!***** Don't read this bit if you plan on watching the film ******* They have to change the mind of a guy whose dad is dying; for money and they do it by going into his brain in three levels THAT IS ALL IT IS! SERIOUSLY THAT IS THE WHOLE STORY ALL THE REST IS FILLER!!!!!*******************************************************************They might of as well put in Peter Griffin grabbing his knee in pain and the naive audience would be none the wiser.

"badajoz-1","6 August 2010","This film was supposed to knock my socks off! Well, I'm still wearing them, because this film was such a disappointment. I thought 'Memento' was brilliant, but 'Dark Knight' a con, although this was supposed to be a total Nolan film. It should have been his 'Heaven's Gate' ( a much better film by the way) but it has proved almost 'Titanic' (again a much better film). Indeed, the audience left the cinema asking each other 'did you enjoy it?' as if they thought it was rubbish, but had to find out whether it was OK to say it was! It was.Let's face it, the plot is little more than a pretend heist movie on a par with 'Ocean's 12.' But it is hidden away in a complicated story of dreams and dreamworlds - three levels worth with each level allowing more time in it compared to reality! Gottit? You should do because Di Caprio spends acres of screen time explaining it to the complete and utter boredom of the audience. Cinema, Doctor K - I think not. It all boils down to finding out why the hero's wife died and how are the gang going to plant an idea in the head of a major industrialist (eg Inception). Following this? As the climax boils (in an extremely prosaic dreamworld hardly worth the effort and CGI) on three different levels - one a minibus falling off a bridge (interminably in slow motion), the second Tom Hardy's screen test for the remake of 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' complete with ski shooters, Blofeld's alpine fortress, and an enemy that cannot kill a hero from five yards!, and the third, a legoland where Di Caprio's wife is skulking siren-like to lure him to stay forever - the film really creaks and shows its' paucity of vision, script, characters, and downright boringness! I have to excuse some of it because I needed the loo and could not get out of my row! Yes, I had a totem which kept me firmly in reality ( I knew how long we had to go by how far the minibus had to fall!).And the plot holes - many, but the worst involved the Cillian Murphy getting killed in the second level which should have left him in mindless limbo on level 3, but he was dead there as well, while Ken Watanabe who died in level 2, became a very old man in level 3!!!! And right at the end, Cillian Murphy has been trained to resist dream thieves, and when he wakes up, he finds himself in the cabin with the gang but does not put two and two together and realise they are the real thieves having persuaded him in his dream otherwise!! Gettit? Don't bother, it was probably all Di Caprio's dream anyway - a load of old tosh that has Nolan laughing all the way to the bank, and many so-called serious critics facing the sack for lavishly overpraising a piece of mediocre tosh!!!","

"SausagePourVous","29 January 2012","Inception makes the average moviegoer feel smart and I would have zero problem with that,unless fans weren't so extremely elitist and condescending. I DO get it...and neither love or hate it. Limited vocabulary but maybe a good read?DiCaprio has reached such super-stardom that can only be compared with Stallone,Schwarzenegger and Will Smith. Meaning:No matter who stars alongside him,he's the only one who sells the film.Just like in Shutter Island,Inceptions trailer only mentions LEONARDO.DICAPRIO.If Watanabe,Cotilliard,Murphy and the rest(Oscarwinners and Oscarnominees,come on) co-star,I might want to know. Studios,respect actors...and ON PAPER,the mix of actors intrigues. Plotwise though,it's all about Mal.Nolan had all the time he wanted to create a caper that was provocative or involved fates of main characters,danger! Morally ambiguous maybe! Yet,planting the seed in a business-mans head that selling his fathers company is his own idea is the result. HOW PG and unpersonal can we get? No room for both a new concept,a bold plot and developed characters...? Nope. Understand it could've been to get a mail-man to call in sick the next day,heist irrelevant. 80% of Inception evolves around the caper,still it merely becomes window dressing,a distraction from the core,the human heart that occasionally beats,being the relationship between Dom and his bad conscience in the shape of Cotilliards Mal.All scenes involving her are superb,it's a nuanced performance worthy of an Oscarnomination. Mal is dangerous,sad,disturbed, beautiful and Very dead. One scene especially involving a ledge is great,heartbreaking cinema. That the person who's most alive and complex is deceased..Paradox...but a good hint at the misuse of actors.Several actors could just've switched names,their characters don't have personalities. What did you do here,Christopher? They describe rules for the dreamworld,dream-extraction,describe what's happening at the moment, that's it.When Swick casted Watanabe in The last samurai,he knew the screenplay matched the mans potential. Nolan has with Batman begins and Inception twice wasted his talent...Murphy? Think I rather see him type-casted as sophisticated sociopaths alá Red Eye then see him as a blank page.Inception's the star and while a detailed construction, intentionally confusing and complex,you DO have to pay attention,complex does not equal intelligent. As you take the ride,things move fast and you're not allowed to break and examine. It's only when it's over you realize you were standing still all along. You are cleverly manipulated into believing the story makes you think(Cause you understand what you saw.Not the same..)or that your mind discovers philosophical metaphors. That you are witnessing something deep is shoved down your throat but depth is mostly absent.Sure,the film deserves the Oscars. Things sound great,look great. Buildings become bridges. An orgasm for the eyes. Pfisters camera-work here is great,very colorful,crisp,clean. Imaginative art direction. I dig Zimmers less-is-more score. In general the whole film's eye candy,perfect surface. The inside...?1.Alright,WAY too much shooting and ""violence"" going on here, considering everyone's sound asleep on a plane and thoughts are murdered. Would've been more intriguing with psychological tension instead of train-crashes and explosions but lack of a REAL physical threat only manages to turn suspense into a dream as well. Sleeping boy vs. thought in zero gravity is so pointless,the impressive CGI just confirms Nolans smug self-awareness of his competent,VISUAL execution and just cements the surface statement. 2. Limbo. Wouldn't a dream-extractors worst nightmare be LIMBO,wouldn't it come up in a conversation between professionals at some point probably? No...not even mentioned until drama occurs. 3.For the 5th time,a womans accidental death consumes a wealthy,white man between 30 and 35 with guilt that will define him and her role is again pivotal. It's getting old and predictable,I hope the issues are worked out by now.4.Last scene. It defines and sums up Inceptions feeling of surface reaching for depth and jaw breaking response,artistic pretensions,strained complexity for the sake of complexity rather then genuinely clever. Nolan in desperation wants to wrap it up so it leaves us scratching our heads... I was banging my head against the seat in front of me when the end credits rolled.He leaves you with two options,no scenarios or reasons that make or should make you come up with an own conclusion. Far from a thinking mans thriller. One of the two is a joke used when referring to funny,lousy twists in B-thrillers. So... No why or how,just IF...IF films were people,Nolans own Memento,The usual suspects or Fight Club would blush,look at 8.8 and put a pistol in their mouth when the words""Smart,thought-provoking thriller"" puts Inception next door to them. The ending insults us,a cop out. Definition of a writer not knowing neither how to quit while ahead or how a journey is gonna reach a classic destination worthy of the plots seemingly intricate layers and ambitions. Sooo...he passes the ball to you and washes his hands with 15 seconds to go,smart lad. A picture this celebrated for being smart should hold up under a magnifying glass. It burns up without you even turning it towards the sun,man. This is an experiment and Nolans monster looks good,but at times,it comes close to the IQ of Dr.Frankensteins creation. DiCaprio gives a solid and mature performance,Hardy makes the most of what little the script offers and gives Eames mannerisms,charisma and a sense of humor. Cotilliard is amazing like stated.The rest could've been portrayed by Gary Busey,Eric Roberts and Lindsay Lohan...Nolans 1st failure is a mix of beauty,superficial intelligence and posturing. Caught between a flawed,pretty entertaining film and a bad one. Mediocre becomes bad when it comes to this director....so shallow.","

"bkoganbing","21 July 2010","Watching Inception with its futuristic emphasis on getting inside people's heads through dreams, especially hearing Leonardo DiCaprio explain the pitfalls to newbie Ellen Page, I couldn't help thinking about Forbidden Planet and that warning about monsters from the Id. Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could not?Christopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times, it still is an unmistakable masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and he's essentially a cat burglar of the mind. His mission usually is to invade people's dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent. But Leo's also a wanted man.Some problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds. He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught, but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate, Cillian Murphy. It's not to steal anything, but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team. The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride. And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on others.Very nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category. Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolan's dialog with verve and conviction. I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought.","

"whistlerspa","21 May 2011","Like many others I cannot see this as a work of genius at all and believe this to be a really stupid movie.The dream team that can manipulate your dreams and waking ideas - Yeah Right - 'in your dreams'. That about sums it all up.The movie writes it's own rule book regarding dreams and assumes that time moves exponentially more slowly when you dream within dreams. There is no evidence for this as fact and my experience and understanding is that dreams can go both ways - sometimes an epic takes minutes and others an action takes hours.So having said that the whole conceptual context falls apart and crumbles into absurdity. And why would movement in a dream affect a dream within a dream as occurs in this movie? When you dream you leave the real world behind - until you awaken.This movie has been compared with the Matrix trilogy. Well it blatantly rips it off but that's another dream - or rather a fantasy. This movie doesn't even come close to Matrix which was truly original and at a stretch even plausible. This isn't.","

"jemps918","15 July 2010","Super blown away by Inception! I can't get over how Christopher Nolan can keep topping himself with each flick. At first I was so scared to see this fail because of the curse of the stellar cast but i should have had faith in Nolan all along. This is just unbelievably good!!! He takes his time telling such a complicated story without dumbing it down or complicating it too much. All the actors play their parts well that even Leo DiCaprio, in a rare way, fades into the character and you forget his celebrity. Everyone and everything is just amazing; from the ominous soundtrack to the sets to the acting and cinematography...all I could say at the end of the flick was, WOW!","

"PlatoSays","14 June 2013","**Only a very teeny spoiler** Well, what can I say? Inception was the most overrated movie I've seen in years. The plot had more holes than a string vest.I found the first 20 mins dull at best, and was easily distracted (I actually paused the film and ordered a pizza/had a look at Twitter/read another message board...). I even restarted the film to give it another chance, but to no avail.Then for a whole 20 mins, it managed to keep my attention before leaving me again thinking 'why I am watching this?' for the next hour or so. I finally gave in with 45 mins to go when it turned into a Bond movie with snow skiing chases that appeared from nowhere.I didn't give a toss about the characters who did nothing to make me want to care, the plot didn't fill more than a few minutes of the 145 mins I stayed with it and bar a few nice CGI tricks - I can't say there was anything not done better in other movies many times over and in a great deal less time.Give me Total Recall for dream based plots and action any day of the week.The acting was average, the architect looked 17yrs old yet somehow became an instant expert in dreams/psychology and managed to be smug - was she the token precocious child that all writers include when their stories are dying on the page? Perhaps a cute pet dog would have helped here.It isn't often that I switch a film off because I think its pointless to carry on. Inception didn't even annoy me enough to see what happened at the end - I simply didn't care. How this is getting anything over a 6/10 is beyond me. I gave it a 4/10 and even then I think I'm being generous - it didn't even score on the So Bad It's Good chart.","

"englishpete65","22 November 2013","A film that starts with much promise and for the first half hour or so works well before descending into farce. The idea of being sent into someone's subconscious or dream state is fascinating but when it comes to the point that someone is sent into a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream it just becomes ridiculous and on this occasion it does not work. Christopher Nolan is a fine Director/screen writer with a tremendous back catalogue of movies and will no doubt add to this back catalogue with more gems as his career continues but Inception is not one of them. Not a terrible movie but not a good one either. If you want to waste an hour and forty odd minutes of your time then go ahead and watch it but there are far better movies that exist.","

"diomavro","3 December 2010","Inception takes the concept of dreaming and turns it into a movie, however its not done as creatively as something like ""eternal sunshine of a spotless mind"". Looking past that there was good potential for character development, but really the only character who even feels remotely developed is the main one. I was loving the first 20minutes of this movie, but after it explained all the rules, instead of doing something creative with it, it just squared it, literally, dreams within dreams within dreams. And Inception turned out to be nothing but an OK action movie that found legit excuses to make half the footage in slow motion. In addition i did despise how the hype with the main characters wife was set up for some epic encounter and then rewarded our attention with just a melodramatic conversation in the end. On the other hand it did offer some splendid effects, but like all movies with such effects, they have nominal value, and as time passes,their real value diminishes.This movie deserves a 6-7 and nothing more.","

"Edu-16","4 February 2011","Don't believe the hype on this one. Its not a bad movie and has some interesting ideas. But its not the birth of a new religion - as some would have it. How this is mentioned in the same sentence as the 'Kings Speech' is beyond me.In general Im delighted to see any attempt to muck around with the usual narrative sequence or which mixes dream with reality. Mememto was a staggering film and I loved the Matrix 1.But after some early promise of mind altering visuals - the majority of the film was played out in what were disappointingly normal landscapes. They reminded me of conventional bond movie sets than anything else. Where was the Escher stair case? Where was the warping of physics? I felt a little let down to be honest. It was only when we reached level four that I became a little more engaged and impressed.The story line itself I felt badly cluttered with too many explanations of the mechanics of invading dreams. It was nearly always noisy and the dialogue often muffled. This made it hard to follow - (and yes, my hearing is fine and I have a state of the art Theatre system) But the really disappointing thing was that with a concept as subtle as invading peoples dreams and planting new ideas - we had to have gun fights all over the place. Frankly the crassness of the shoot outs clashed rather awkwardly with some intelligent ideas about the nature of reality. And why did all the baddies have 'A-team' shooting accuracy? Last point - wouldn't it have been rather easier to persuade the target to do what they needed him to - through non-dream means?","

"deatman9","27 July 2011","When I first heard of this movie I could not wait to see it. I heard nothing but good reviews and it had Leo dicaprio which im am a huge fan. It was directed by christoper nolan the man who brought us the dark knight (another one of my favorites) so I watched this with very high expectations and sadly they were not met.This movie is set in the near future where it is actullay possible to enter someones mind and memories through their dreams. So a dream thief (leonardo)is sent into a persons mind to achieve ""inception""Now everybody is going to hate me for this but I thought this movie was just silly. The way they explained it and the explanations they had for everything were convoluted and silly. Then it had about hour of story and then about a hour and a half of shooting guns. You would think a movie with this complicated of story line would describe the story in depth but no. It piles on the information one thing after another in a ridiculous manner. If you liked the matrix and are usually a fan of this kind of Sci-Fi thing then this movie is most likely for you. If you are like me and prefer a movie to have solid story development and you want it to make total sense please stay away from this. The only reason i gave it 6 was because it was high budget it had leo and also some pretty stunning moments.","

"ukproject","14 October 2010","As a true science fiction fan and a big fan of Memento, I was really looking forward to a mind-bending science fiction classic.You can't get much more of a creative license than have dreams and dream manipulation as the main subject matter. Any Director worth his salt should be able to really put on something special and I was expecting something spectacular from Christopher Nolan.Calling Inception an anti-climax would be an understatement. It was an utter and complete let-down. The special effects looked more suited to a music video, the character development was non-existent, the plot was simple and one-dimensional and once the movie ended the only thing that I was struggling to figure out was how on earth could so many people be so gullible.What a missed opportunity.If you're really looking for something mind bending that deals with dream states, dream manipulation and altered states of consciousness, try watching the superb 2009 6 part mini-series 'The Prisoner'.","

"Danielpotato","30 December 2016","Inception has a problem that I cannot bear: the constant that someone comes to explain the laws and how that world works. The creation of the character of Ellen Page (Ariadne) was for the sole purpose of explaining that to moviegoers. Not that it's bad, but at certain moments it seems like the movie becomes more class at school, to know how that universe works, instead of the characters in this movie live the adventure for themselves. In this aspect the film is didactic. And the space for the imagination is limited. In this aspect everything in this film is chewed, everything explained, where are the possibilities? I do not want someone to explain the universe, I want to see the characters live and react in this universe.Yes the ending leaves open the question whether that is a dream or reality, but it is a cheap gimmick instead of letting them our imaginations fly. If at the end of the movie the experience of the characters was a dream, so it was waste of two and a half hour, at least the Matrix shows the characters in the real world, and that it was not a dream inside a dream. The tension and time invested would not be a waste of time Not that it spoils the experience of the film, but it disturbs in some parts, mainly in the middle of the film, when the group is preparing for the assault. The concept is good, but it should be presented in a simpler way. Clearly Nolan was very ambitious in the concept of this film. But Nolan is quite integral in the proposal of his films, and he tries to put unknown concepts to the general public in such a cohesive way, even with the problem of trying to explain everything and other problems of pace are easily forgiven. Nolan tries to do his best in each of his films as if his movie was his last, as if his life depends on it. A great honesty on the part of Nolan, and this I can and I want to enjoy. Nolan is such an honest guy and scores points with me. It's the difference between the lousy movie director and an excellent director. The bad elements of Inception are not enough to spoil its qualities. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works. Not that the idea of Inception is innovative, this idea has been copied many times in other works (Paprika, Synecdoche New York and The Matrix are the most practical and common examples). But it's the way Nolan puts these ideas in the big budget blockbuster. Let's be honest here. Smaller or lower budget films are not seen by the general public due to the absence of of large production values (a great soundtrack, great locations for filming or great special effects, etc). See these ideas or concepts in a great Hollywood blockbuster made with such quality and care, it is amazing. And these ideas are embedded in the drama of the film in such a cohesive and exemplary way; it is applauding Nolan's professional integrity. This is why Nolan movies are so well received, he tries to put in these Hollywood blockbusters something more, something common in indie or smaller films, but with the financial aspect of the great studios to provide a better technical quality.Obviously there is quality on this movie; the large parallel sequences are exemplary. The parallel between the Van sequences, the hotel with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt (when character is awake in the elevator), the peak at the military base in the snow and the desolate city of Cobb and Mal is almost perfectly made with an all- encompassing soundtrack. Of course the sequences of action are lousy . And many dialogues are very weak. Two weaknesses in Nolan's movies.Bad things come with the good things. I suspect that the bad action scenes of Inception and Dark Knight were the reason why Nolan turned DKR into an action movie instead of trying to tell a good story, Nolan's ego should have been hurt by the criticism as he directs his action scenes in these two films. Particularly Inception and the action sequence in the snow with Tom Hardy. Too bad, sorry.But the performances are amazing, particularly Marion Cotillard as Mal. There are many layers in the various characters which Nolan conducts with mastery and the way they are inserted into the film is almost perfectly. Particularly in the initial sequence (which I thought would be a scene to showcase special effects, and Nolan proved me wrong). Or in the scene between Ariadne and Cobb, when Cobb tries to explain how his wife dies, and then discovered new layers of the character to reveal that in fact, he did have to do with the death of his wife. Of course this will be important to the outcome of the film. It is this ability to put the scenes and the flashbacks in certain key moments of the plot that Nolan shows much quality, and one of his long lists of virtues. Inception is a movie like any movie; it has its flaws, but also its virtues. But, for me the qualities overlap the defects, and in the end the movie is well worth watching. But is its legendary statute being worthy? If Inception was released in the 1980's would it have the same impact in that decade, as it had in 2010? Currently the commercial movies in Hollywood are in crisis. We live in an era of remakes, superhero movies and franchise fatigue without the studios or directors making an effort to improve with originality or at least with a little more original concepts. Inception's credit could be lower if today's Hollywood was not in such a decadent state. But nonetheless, Inception is still a good movie.","

"catch_a_fire_2079","5 August 2010","After reading all the amazing reviews and seeing a score of 9.3...3rd best movie of all time, I had to go watch Inception. Also I really like Memento...it was such a cool, original movie..so I was looking forward to this.I went to see this movie last weekend. It was an 11:00pm showing on Sunday night, 3 weeks after opening night and the theatre was packed! We had to sit in the second row...something I don't mind at all.Epic Fail The movie is about corporate (not even government) spies, that enter people's dreams through some unexplained technology. Once in the dream, they trick the victim into giving up his/her secrets. Pretty simple premise, and one that can be taken into many directions (after all we're in dreamland). Well the direction is down the crapper.The whole premise of the movie is so shallow, Saito, a corporate CEO hires Cobb (Leo) to go into another CEO's dream and plant an idea of breaking up his fathers empire (upon his father's death), so that Saito can have a monopoly. How's that for a story?? What a joke.Well the movie starts slow and drags on and on, besides that there are so many plot holes and explaining of everything that happens..like they manipulate the victim by having a dream, within a dream, within a dream. When you are falling in the first dream, the second layer has no gravity, but the third and forth layer has gravity?? WHAAAA??? Also even though you are in a dream, you have no super powers..you use boring guns? How about shooting lighting bolts out your you know what?? BOOORRING.To add to the boredom, Cobb's wife Mal killed herself because she thought she was dreaming. And appears regularly to bore us to death, you get the sense that she's supposed to be evil, but it never pans out.This was interesting on one level only...there was no antagonist. But then again there was no love interest either, and on top of that no danger, cause if you get killed in a dream, all you do is wake up.This movie is amoral tripe with no imagination..eg. you are in a dream world, instead of driving around in a VAN, why not fly? Instead of shooting guns, why not freeze them in their tracks? Also, there are many people (I assume teenagers) who are saying how original this movie is. The Dream within a Dream thing has been done before...it's called ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3: Dream Warriors""..also don't EVER compare this tripe to the ""Matrix"". Matrix was original, it was filled with clever allegory, it was truly awe inspiring, but there was NOTHING clever about Inceptipon.The climax was okay, but just because after 2 hours I couldn't wait to get out of there.Now the anti-climax, is an entirely different animal, like the viewer hasn't been insulted enough...we are left to ponder weather it was ""all a dream"" (again not very original). The answer is yes, it was all a dream, and Cobb is still in a dream..his kids look exactly the same, even wearing the same clothes as his other dreams.Please do yourself a favour and do not pay to see this garbage. So far the best movie this summer has been Predators...how sad. People think this movie is clever and original because they are teenagers..it probably is clever and original to them, but any adult will find this movie dull and boring. Inception = Fail IMDb for having Inception in your top 3 movies = EPIC FAIL.If I was the credibility Nazi, I'd say to IMDb ""NO CREDIBILITY FOR YOU!""2/10 for exploiting a big budget.","

"RichardSRussell-1","16 July 2010","Inception (2:28, PG-13) — 9 — Science Fiction; biggie; original2009 was an amazing year for SF&F movies, with 7 original films (Avatar, District 9, Inglourious Basterds, Inkheart, Star Trek, Up, and Watchmen) getting my top rating of 9. 2010 so far has been disappointing, with only 4 (How To Train Your Dragon, Kick-Ass, Shrek Forever After, and Toy Story 3) getting as high as 8. But the dry spell is finally over, and in absolutely smashing fashion.Christopher Nolan has a grand total of 9 films to his credit, but they include such outstanding productions as Memento (2000), The Prestige (2006), and The Dark Knight (2008). Furthermore, in addition to directing, he co-wrote the screenplays for those movies with his brother Jonathan. They were marvels of intricacy, with layer upon layer of hidden meaning and nuance, slowly revealed as the story progressed. Now, as solo screenwriter and director, he has produced a masterpiece, the mind-blowing Inception.He takes an idea which I 1st read about in Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer Prize–winning 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, and turns it into a riveting drama. Hofstadter wrote about a storyteller who gets his protagonist to a cliff-hanger point in a story, then has him start telling another story, which in turn leads to its own crisis, and then again, and then again. After the crisis is resolved at the final, deepest level, we go up and up and up again, and finally out. Only then does Hofstadter call our attention to the fact that we went down 4 levels but only came back up for 3 of them.Nolan uses this same idea (along with some Escherian visuals) with a wrinkle: It's not a story, it's a dream, and the dreamers are wired together so they share each others' experiences. Furthermore, there's a time-dilation effect (familiar to most people from their own dreams at least as far back as Mark Twain's ""The Great Dark"") in which an hour in dreamland is only 5 minutes in the real world. And if a person in dreamland goes into a deeper dream, the effect is compounded, so that a seeming lifetime can pass during only a short nap.In the near future, a small coterie of researchers has gotten good at this, and they make some shady money extracting hidden memories from the subconscious of people whose dreams they invade. Then a new proposition comes along. Wealthy power-company tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants to do the opposite — not to retrieve a memory but to plant one in the mind of Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy), the heir to the rival Fischer-Morrow Corp. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is confident it can be done, despite the misgivings of the rest of his team, but he warns that it will require going down multiple layers, for 2 reasons: (1) the new idea has to be so subtly insinuated that the target will think he came up with it himself, for reasons he would find credible, and (2) Fischer has undergone training to resist this very kind of dream incursion, and his subconscious comes equipped with alarms and security guards to snap him out of any ordinary dream state.But wait, there's more! Normally, when you're ""killed"" in a dream, you just wake up. But this endeavor involves not merely multiple levels but also a powerful anesthetic, and the combination means that anyone ""killed"" in dreamland will stay there forever, in a kind of limbo, lost to reality.And still more! Cobb's dead wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) shows up every time he enters dreamworld, whether he's the primary dreamer himself or piggybacking on someone else's. Even tho she's just a figment of his imagination, he's got a really GOOD imagination, and she has her own reasons for wanting to keep him in the dream state, so she's always trying to thwart his best-laid plans. So Cobb himself can't have TOO much knowledge, in his waking state, of whatever imaginary world they're planning to take the target into. But, while he recognizes this in himself and compensates for it, he has other blind spots that could endanger his entire team. Fortunately, he's engaged the brilliant young architect Ariadne (Ellen Page) to design his mazes for him, and she tumbles to some of his personal demons.But wait, there's STILL more And so it goes, layer upon layer, complexity atop complexity, and you start to think you shouldn't be able to tell the players without a scorecard, but somehow Nolan gives you just enuf visual cues to help you keep straight at least 4 simultaneous story threads, as he intercuts rapidly between them.It is a tour de force, the best SF&F movie of the year. It's not for slow learners, but anyone who's easily bored will have absolutely no problem staying awake. Indeed, after this, you may be reluctant to ever fall asleep again.","

"cadillac20","16 July 2010","If there is anything that Inception has taught me, it's that anything is possible with films. There are very few films that I have seen that deliver this message. Star Wars delivered a galaxy full of imaginative creation. The Matrix showed us a world where rules could be broken and people could dodge bullets. Avatar took us to another world the likes of which we have never seen. Now, Inception takes us to places we can only dream of. I will start by saying two things that may contradict each other. The first is that this film has something for everyone. There's plenty of action, drama, noir, suspense, and mind games for those who like to be intrigued. At the same time, this will not be a film for everyone. The nit-picky will find all the little tiny things to question, most notably the logic involved in the whole subconscious sneakery and 'whose dream are we in?' logic. But quite honestly, any possible holes are completely forgiven. Not only is this the best written film of the year, but this is one of the most imaginative films in years.I really have to applaud Nolan for taking a chance. Few filmmakers would dare to go out on such a limb and not only try and create such a complex web of dream logic and rules, but also make sense of so many things going on at once. At one point in the film there are four different realities occurring at the same time. There are only a few filmmakers I can even think of that would dare try and create such feat. Even fewer I can think of that make it work. And Nolan does. At first, all the dream logic had my head buzzing, but it mattered little once we hit the dream world. While dizzying, the exposition fits. It's so fascinating and so far from anything that we have seen that the first hour, which is mainly made up of explanations of how things work, is rather welcome as opposed to frowned upon.Nolan's writing shines here. He does what The Matrix once did and bends rules, even breaking some to shape a wholly different reality where cities topple and even gravity gives way to a change in the rules of reality. It's completely fascinating and suspenseful. I even found myself exhaling out loud. And while it may seem like nothing much more than a whole bunch of pretty images and special effects, this is all supported by a strongly written main character and well acted supporting cast. Although the only really deep relationships here are between DiCaprio's character Cobb and his wife and Page's character, the cast as a whole is enjoyable. Joseph Gordon Levitt is the action heavy, doing a lot of the physical fighting, while Tom Hardy is the comic relief (when comedy presents itself). There are a few a members who could be called one note. Watanabe's character is a fairly one note evil corporate head type and Cillian Murphy plays the gullible victim. But even these characters have moments of humanity which shine through.While the film deals in reality defying moments, there are some very entertaining, more practical elements, like the shootouts and the heist planning. These play out like their subsequent genre staples, and I'm very thankful for that. The shootouts are practical and exciting. The heist elements will be familiar to anyone who is familiar with the heist sub-genre, but in this case it's all about people who deal in cerebral elements and must plan their actions around mental manipulation and subconscious trickery. I don't think I could say enough about my enjoyment of this film, but I will say that it is truly one of the best film events in recent memory that I have enjoyed. While this summer has been filled with disappointment at the theater, Inception was worth it. If this film doesn't grab your imagination by the balls, then I don't know what will.","

"bayou_hannibal","31 May 2012","As Christopher Nolan's budgets get bigger, his movies get worse. He is an excellent director when he is given a project that isn't overly ambitious. With his more ""epic"", ""blockbuster"" films though, he shows a lot more weaknesses. Nothing illustrates those weaknesses more than Inception. It is a movie that starts off at the same level as Memento, but declines and hits rock bottom on the same level as the recent Transformers movies. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the last 45 minutes or so of the movie is that bad. It is nothing but the same loud, poorly shot, poorly choreographed, and boring action that has spread throughout movies nowadays like a disease.For at least the first hour, I could see why this movie got such great reviews. It presents itself initially as a dark and surreal Ocean's Eleven. The first act is spent acquainting us with the rules of dream thievery while the main character, Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), assembles his ""safecracking"" team. In typical caper movie fashion, he finds the specialists that he needs, all of whom have their own talents and personalities. There is the chemist who will whip up the special cocktail needed to sedate everyone for this special job. There the dream actor who can impersonate anyone. There is the financier who hired Cobb and wants to come along to monitor his investment. There is the architect responsible for building the dreamscapes in which the ""safecrackers"" will pull off their caper. The target of this scheme is Robert Fischer (Cilian Murphy), the sole heir to a huge corporate empire. The purpose of this scheme is not to steal anything, but to implant the idea into Fischer's head that he should break up his father's empire. To do that, Cobb and his buddies concoct an incredibly complex scheme that involves a dream within a dream within a dream.For a while, I thought that I was in heaven. But then, in Act II when the caper officially starts, I began to feel doubts. Within minutes, there is a massive car chase and the bullets are flying from all directions. When the dreaming starts, you get a taste of what the rest of the movie is going to be like. Tons and tons of shooting, chases, and action that drags on and on despite having almost no relevance to the plot. It's bad in the dream, it's pretty bad in the dream within a dream, and Holy Jesus, is it ever awful in the dream within a dream within a dream.As the movie progresses, the action becomes more pointless and the action scenes become progressively harder to follow. Dozens of guys who dress like Secret Service agents are gunned down or karate chopped to death. Approximately a half hour is one gigantic non-stop action scene that takes place across all of the dream levels. While the idea of a half hour of non-stop action might sound nice, it drags horribly. Almost no plot development takes place this entire time. There is a shot of a van slowly falling towards the water. Across the long action scene, that van is shown about five or six times. By the time that you are done with this movie, you will be sick to death of seeing that stupid van falling towards the water.Why is it that this movie can't make gunfire and car chases exciting? For starters, the action is very poorly choreographed. You get no sense of location. The challenges that the good guys are facing aren't clearly laid out. Who is where? How many bad guys are there? What you do get is good old shaky-cam, loads of CGI, Matrix-inspired floating, and close-ups of dudes shooting guns. In other words, you get the crap that has virtually destroyed action movies nowadays. Today's directors could learn a lot from action classics like Commando and Die Hard.Speaking of CGI, this movie also has tons of that, and it is technologically impressive, but mostly pointless. The one scene that everybody seems to rave about is the Paris scene where half of the city gets folded in over itself. Eh – whatever. It looks cool, but – who cares? When did this become part of having a great movie? And why is it that the Road Warrior and the original Star Wars still look cooler to me than modern movies with five times the budget?While I enjoyed most of the non-action parts, this also is probably Nolan's most pretentious movie. The movie starts with the line ""What is the most resilient parasite?"" The answer: ""an idea"". What is this twaddle? Ideas aren't like parasites. I'm constantly seeing ideas brought up, shot down, and forgotten about. And why do you need to tell me this – to look smart? Inception is constantly throwing new dream rules at you, and by the end they are a confusing mess. It is these kinds of problems that inspire people to criticize Inception as being a dumb movie that tries to position itself as a smart one.To sum it all up, I think that Inception, in 20 years, will not be viewed by Christopher Nolan fans as one of his best. In fact, I believe that it is his worst film. This guy cannot do good action, and when he has a budget to spend, it seems to just make the movie longer and prettier, but not better. From these criticisms, you might get the impression that I hated the movie. I didn't. Even during the most boring scenes, I wanted the whole scheme to work, and I cared about Dom Cobb enough to be hoping that he would triumph in the end. I did enjoy it enough to watch the movie a second time, just to see if I would like it better. I had the same feelings again – falling in love at first, only to be disappointed in the end.","

Prestige was the first movie that I watched of him and I loved it. The Dark Knight was the movie that I had the highest expectations and it did not let me down. I know there are 10 things not to like The Dark Knight but for me there were 1000 things to like. But this time I AM disappointed. Inception is like the cutest car that can't run very fast. It has its good looking but no good plot and a million questions about the concept.There are a few simple rules about a science fiction movie or story. When you watch one there are things you feel right or not. You can use your wildest imaginations but at some point they have to make sense. This film certainly did not feel right. This was like a low budget science fiction which starts well but loses it after a while except for this was a big budget movie! Well there ARE a few things to like about this movie. It has a good concept, good graphics and good acting. If the plat was better and a few more things made more sense this could have been the masterpiece everyone thinks it to be.","

"areatw","13 July 2018","Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' often gets a mention in many 'best films of all time' lists, despite the fact that this is probably one of the least rewarding and most pointless films I've ever watched.It spends the whole of its bloated two-and-a-half hour running length trying to prove how intellectually superior it is, yet requires the characters to spell out virtually every development of the ridiculously messy and convoluted plot.An intentionally complex and non-linear storyline is not smart, but pretentious filmmaking. What exactly is the point in such a bewildering minefield of a plot in which the ending presents more questions than the start? The only reason I can think of is to satisfy the ego of those who like to think of themselves as smarter than they actually are.'Inception' is one of the most overhyped, overrated and pretentious films I've ever seen.","

"freshorange","6 August 2010","What a disappointment! This movie is a technically good heist movie wrapped in a dream plot, that is boring like hell! The dreams look almost exactly like the reality and during the whole movie constantly somebody is shooting, running or escaping!Christoper Nolan outdoes himself in taking almost all the inspiring and challenging aspects away from an interesting idea! He strings together one exhausting action sequence after another without any creativity or a fresh, new approach regarding the exploration of dreams!The further you delve into the dream levels, the more you get bored by more spiritless action. At the end i thought: oh, perhaps i missed the point and this is the next James Bond movie and they deliberately left away the 007 in the the title to open up a further, contrived dimension.Inception looks like an intelligent, complex movie - that is what it wants to be - but it is only an action flick with almost none character development or intellectual aspiration.Christopher Nolan perhaps knows to impress technically but he fails completely to let me really care about his protagonists and the storyline. Technical perfection, the use of visual and special effects and an allegedly complex story can't substitute real vision, creativity and good character development! That's the difference between Inception and a masterpiece.","

"kevinalvarezp","11 January 2011","Christopher Nolan has undoubtedly become one of the most important names in the business of contemporary filmed entertainment.He has taken us to places we did not know existed.He singlehandedly revived a languishing cartoon franchise and placed it in the pantheon of unforgettable classics. In his new adventure he takes on the uncharted universe of the subconscious. The premise in its scope is intriguing and unconceivable ambitious.he relies on the best movie making talent only a major movie studio can buy to achieve his goal.The special effects are terrific, the acting is pretty good, and the dialogue is also good, but the journey that started as an unrestrained adventure into the realms of the human thought generating universe turned half way thru into a tale of semi confusing scenes. The story never comes anywhere near of seducing its audience. The emotional factor is completely absent.The movie is worth watching and it does stand out mostly due to lack of quality competition, but it should not be an Oscar nominee. Christopher Nolan has done better work.","

"MovieGuy109","24 July 2011","I have never felt more against the critical and commercial spotlight than I did in Inception. I felt it was okay, not bad, but certainly not good. The plot is weighted down by brainless action scenes added by Director Nolan just to keep people watching amidst the confusion. I prefer action that has more relevance when I am watching a film. The film's main focus is dreams, but I did not feel like I was in a dream, only a web of destruction at the hands of computer generated explosions! I think there is a certain creativity in Inception, however it was lost amidst the lack of comprehensive filmmaking and intelligent screen writing.","

"sj7075-292-151006","13 June 2018","This movie started off terrible, and then just got worse and worse.From the premise of the movie, the ending, it was cliche and tiresome to the point of annoyance. I nearly walked out of this film. With the 2 other people I watched this movie with, I asked them both to name one other characters name in this movie 5 minutes after we walked out of it. Neither could name a character besides the lead, who was only memorable as he was a complete an utter liability (DiCaprio's character Cobb). Each character is introduced into this movie like a comedy, with no backstory, or substance to them, and with there name barely mentioned. The lead characters father introduces one of the character, which just happens to be a fresh face university student, who just happens to be down for some CRIME.The chemist, who has a maybe a hundred different bottles of potions behind him, ALL UNLABELLED, who just picks one out and says ""this is the one you need, oh yeah, I'm down for some CRIME, I'll join you.""All the other characters are incredibly forgettable as you go further into this movie and the plot unravells, where you begin to think to yourself ""is this the best way to do this? Or just the most complicated and ridiculous way?"" Southparks parody of this film sums up this movie perfectly.The dramatic scenes of tension are EXHAUSTING where you actually get bored of them, and the pace of the scene is just frozen in a seizure. It's not comfortable at all that was where I just wanted to walk out. The lead character is also a cliched abomination that lets this entire movie down with his backstory, that lingers like a leaking sewer in the air. It slows down the entire movie again, and caps it all off too. People rating this movie so highly really haven't looked at this movie objectively at the substance of the movie or its characters, or the MANY, MAAAANY holes in the story, or just how cliche the entire premise and story is. The worst movie I'll never forget.","

"numenorsniper-66396","23 November 2021","I first started watching Nolan movies with Memento like 20 years ago when I was a teenager, then went to the cinema to see all three of his Batman movies, The Prestige, Inception, and Interstellar.I really think that it can be hard to decide which of his movies truly is his definitive best, as he has a few that hit the mark just right. But from re-watching them a bunch over the years, I do feel that Inception hits the hardest, even though Interstellar and The Dark Knight have their own weighty effect different from Inception.I watch movies for the magic and emotion, and even though The Dark Knight is technically excellent and brilliantly acted, the strengths of Inception edge it out slightly I think.I love the cast of Inception; especially the incredible performances of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, and Ellen Page.Those four actors in this movie are pure magic, especially accented with Leo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe, along with everyone else.The holy trinity of Nolan in my mind at least, are Inception, Interstellar, and The Dark Knight, with The Prestige and Memento not far behind.I can't wait to see Nolan make an even greater magnum opus, one to dethrone Shawshank Redemption from its imdb number 1 spot. I feel that if any living director can do it, it would be Nolan.","

"Caribstu","3 September 2010","INCEPTION The dialogue in this film is preoccupied with explaining what is happening, rather than being natural. This is very possibly due to the director feeling the concept of the film was too complicated for mere cinema goers to comprehend and instead of enhancing the film as a good flowing natural dialogue might it in fact has a tendency to spoil the film. It is also very repetitive, continually repeating the rules of inception, the inner workings of the dream construction. It becomes very annoying and I'm sure Inception holds the world record for saying the word 'dream' more times than any other.There is a concept in teaching, developed by the Americans which goes like this, tell the people what you are going to teach them, then teach it to them, then tell them what is was you just taught them. It seems the director has adopted this method of explaining to the audience, just in case they are too stupid to get it for themselves, what the film is about and what is happening.Di Caprio who in my opinion is a talented actor that often picks challenging roles was neither commanding nor outstanding. Partly due to the lack of any real structure to the film as the whole thing seemed too fluid and poured out in a tsunami of CGI. Additionally there is no kind of character development, something Di Caprio is generally masterful at, leaving the film feeling hollow and a waste of an otherwise talented cast. Something Hollywood studios will often do when trying to portray highly intelligent criminals (or evil masterminds) is cast British actors, and it is noticeable in Inception that director Christopher Nolan has not broken away from the stereotype.A previous reviewer wrote ""The stupid dialog is there, because Nolan did not know, how to push the plot forward in an integrated way"" and i totally agree.I've heard a lot about how Inception is the new Matrix and I must confess I have never watched Matrix, I did sit down and try, on three occasions to do so, but all three times i fell asleep out of sheer boredom. That is not sarcasm it is real. I know the Matrix story as it's so well known, whether or not Inception is the new Matrix i cannot say but I can confess it's a fairly redundant mediocre film with an over contrived plot strung together by cliché action scenes. The plot concept is not so difficult to comprehend and seems to be hyped up for what it really is. The only real thought needed is that of the closing shot, (this is not a spoiler ).. does it tip or does it keep spinning? I smell a sequel.3/10","

"NanoFrog","31 October 2010","As an American Indian i was raised, unlike modern people, with a deep ceremonial experience with dreaming. Every idea in modern society seems to diminish the natural ability of people to dream and to remember what they dream. A film like this exploits the natural interest people have in dreams to tell an impossible story. As entertainment it is passable, even interesting...as information on dreaming it is not only worthless, it takes the mind away from any hope of effective dreaming. This is the toxic nature of the film-making experience, where we see reality in such a skewed and unreliable way that we no longer understand reality. Human society has surrendered its powers to dream to the church, to the university, to the corporate paymaster and so modern life is for most people dreamless. Given an opportunity to bring some great idea about dreaming to the screen, the filmmakers instead make a fantasy that is complicated, over-acted and so unrealistic I am just amazed that so many dreamless people have given it such a high rating. Dreaming takes place inside the human spirit, real dreaming takes place among groups of people. But people no longer know this. Dreaming evolved in the human mind from the many thousands of generations people spent living and sleeping together...which they no longer do. As an experienced dreamer I think this film is useless. As one who likes a good film, I think it is useless. Modern people just don't get it, and this sadness is the major component in the new world order.","

"moonspinner55","5 August 2010","Writer-director Christopher Nolan's byzantine puzzle-movie ""Inception"" is so fully engulfed in a surreal sort of Raison d'être--while also managing to introduce a new set of rules to us, though not appearing to abide by those rules near the finale--it's easy to understand why some audiences are embracing the film as a masterpiece. These days, if a film is complexly-layered it is automatically deemed art...not popcorn entertainment ready for mass consumption, but high art. If ""small minds"" are unable to grasp the film's deeper meanings, those poor folks are disregarded as unworthy participants in the ultimate game. ""Inception"" is a game--and, at times, a grand one--but it isn't a masterpiece. It's a gun-crazy, gadget-mad, hyperactive Rubik's Cube of a movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the grieving Cobb, a dream extractor who enters into the sleeping minds of others to gather vital information which cannot be obtained any other way. Unfortunately, memories of his late wife (and guilt over her mysterious death) are so vivid they are permeating Cobb's subconscious; and inevitably those haunted images follow him helplessly on his jaunts into the dream-state. The movie has very little exposition, with a confusing prologue later revealed to be the starter threads to the epilogue, and doesn't really get going until we are introduced to Cobb's latest case involving a dying billionaire, his crestfallen son, and the final draft of the tycoon's will which is locked up in a safe no one knows the combination to. The other participants in the project are a brainy, adept, and engaging group of people we become quite fond of; often times, particularly in a perplexing movie such as this one, having such smart, savvy characters populating the scenario makes the ride that much more enjoyable (not forgetting of course that humans are never so vulnerable to danger as when they are asleep). What doesn't really work are the constant sniper attacks in the dreams--projections which manifest themselves as an angry militia--as well as a visual impersonation of the son's godfather, which is necessary to the plot but becomes little more than a complicated footnote. The level of dreams our heroes pass through, one more dangerous than the last, provide the picture with a visual kick, and the nonchalant manner in which the characters respond to their strange new surroundings accent ""Inception"" with a giddiness not usually found in big-budget action films. I'm not sure whether or not Christopher Nolan violates his own movie-rules in order to cap the film with an emotional bow, but he does get solid performances from his cast, a rich and delectable production design from his art department, and swirling, hallucinogenic special effects from his creative team. Is the movie a mind-blowing experience? For many audiences, it certainly will be. As with all 'summer epics' and popcorn crowd-pleasers, this one's crazy glow will probably fade in the stretch (I can't imagine the film will hold up so well once it goes the home-video route--it's a theatrical experience, after all). It is not a work of art, however that doesn't mean it isn't sheer pleasure from start to finish. *** from ****","

"stopjen","16 August 2010","Everyone knows no matter how absurd it is, a dream is as real as (sometimes more so than) reality. Instead of taking advantage of this (lack of creativity? too scared?), the film confines itself to mirroring reality in every way - be it time, space, surroundings, physicality, ideas, or behaviours. Under the incoherent, made-up-as-we-go logic, the film is but a low-grade action film in a sci-fi disguise. The story line is laughably childish, the music is over dramatic and there's zero character development. It's a shame to see Ellen Page and Michael Caine's talent abused in this dribble. It's such a pity, really. In the right hand the same material could flourish and treat us to mind-blowing wonders and imaginations. Christopher Nolan has missed the point completely: dreams can be absolutely anything. Anything! We want to see rules bent and physics defied. But instead we were given the action sequence and plot from a 70s B movie. Entertainment-wise it's not that bad a film (admittedly there are far worse action films around), probably 2.5 stars if you leave your brain outside the theatre. But given the current unjustified high rating, I have to give it a super low one to tip the balance.","

"juliahro","9 February 2011","It is obvious people do enjoy psychological thrillers, virtual reality, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Inception, having it all, will astonish and marvel crowds of cinema goers into thinking they are smart and profound just for getting or liking the movie. I have to say, I admire the movie's performance into tricking its viewers like that; because that's what it is, a trick. A dream within a dream, and doesn't that sound attractive...It is the kind of movie that gets nominated for Oscar just for its crowd pleasing abilities, and Oscars are born within the capitalist world and needs all the capital it can get. Just like Avatar got nominated in the ""best movie"" category... I've read some review saying Inception could be the movie of the decade; obviously, the guy didn't see that many movies in the last ten years; there are better movies in 2010 only, and a bunch of them.I'm not saying the movie is bad; it's a good movie for its genre; what I didn't like about it is the fuss it created (and that fuss will disappear like it disappeared before for other crowd adored films), but mostly its lack of authenticity, therefore its PRETENTIOUSNESS.This is not a gem - it is a pile of dust in the eyes.","

I laughed at the Kubrick tributes. Beyond that, the thing was too simple for words - but dressed up to be a deep and meaningful experience. You know you are watching a loser when an elevator takes you up and down the guy's consciousness. An elevator? Now who dreamed that up?World domination? A Japanese accent that is unintelligible? Cartoonish characters of all shades (to sell tickets?) Two female leads, one of whom is frighteningly out of whack with the film's storyline (she doesn't understand anything, but is designing the project!), and the other wandering through scenes meant to be scary but - hey, you need to be able to act first, and it would help to then act scary.This film is a mess - except for the avalanche and freight train.","

"TaZmAnOO7","22 July 2010","Went to see this film recently and was very disappointed. I was expecting something amazing given the extremely high IMDb rating - couldn't have been more disappointed with this movie.The special effects were good, but apart from that, I think the film didn't work particularly well and it's totally over-rated.The acting was nothing amazing and the story is not as clever as it pretends to be. I agree with some other reviewers on here, that this film passes itself off as being very intelligent and clever but only for people who don't have any intelligence and are easily pleased.I like Nolan's other work - Dark Knight was excellent, however, this movie is nowhere near as good and felt pretty lame.I think a lot of people who don't even understand this movie, just gave it a high rating assuming it was a clever movie when it actually wasn't that good at all.This movie is certainly 'not' a masterpiece or anything even close. It felt like a Matrix wannabe, but I have to say The Matrix blows this movie out of the water by a huge margin.As I write this review, this movie is currently in the top 3 movies of all time?? I've never been more shocked - get real people. It seems the film companies are paying people to vote on here and boost their films - there can be no other explanation. Very disappointing and was expecting so much more from this movie. Don't bother paying to see it in the cinema as you will feel let down.","

"captain_dimpf","31 August 2010","What a let down. Due to the hype and exuberant reviews I had expected something akin to Eternal Sunshine or at least something not totally unlike The Matrix. Instead we get something like 'the Cell' without the lush imagery, but with plot holes so big that even Jorge Garcia would drop through them. So what is it that makes this film so mediocre. 1. The shoot outs and action scenes. Seriously, I've seen better in James Bond films from the early eighties, even if you deem this to be impossible. But what makes those scenes so utterly annoying is that there is no purpose to them whatsoever other than to appeal to people who like to see things go 'bang' and no doubt play first-person shooters in their bedrooms. Those guns don't propel the story forward a single inch.2. The cast. Nothing happens between Leonardo and Marion. There is no spark, no chemistry, thus you can't really understand why Leonardo would consider staying in a dreamworld just to be together with his old flame that he doesn't seem to have any affection for when she was alive.3. The Alibi cutie. If you eliminate Allen Page from the script, no-one would spot the difference. Honestly folks, if the architect of a dream landscape is so important and the wrong fabric of a bathmat can thwart the success of a mission, why don't we get any insight of how this whizz kid designs those dreamscapes and what makes her so indispensable. If we had any inkling what exactly she was doing there apart from looking pretty she would have been far less annoying.4. The aforementioned holes in the plot. Too numerous to mention here, just think about this: if someone who has a dream in a dream and in the first dream he sits in a van that drops down a bridge, there is no logical way he would be weightless in the second dream cause physically he doesn't sit in the van and mentally he doesn't know about the moments without gravity. Dreams just don't work like that and it is an insult to peoples intelligence to suggest that they do.But if all that was not enough, there is so much more inconsistency here, like for instance, why would a tycoon who has the money to buy up entire airlines and the power to overrule the judicial system in America be so utterly afraid of some healthy competition that he risks being lost in his dreamworld for more than thirty years? I think 'good clean fun-loving popcorn movie' is just an euphemism for brainless mainstream crap from America but what is even worse is brainless mainstream crap that claims to be sophisticated. This film certainly is not.","

"howardeisman","24 April 2011","I have given this one star because the high rating this movie had is out of all proportion. There are myriads of far better films with lower scores. Let's get this score down.I have the impression that this movie started with a script which had a couple of scenes in the middle, and it was then written further to extend it to a beginning and an end. The mystery is why anyone bothered to try to have a coherent script in the first place. Plot? we don't need no stinkin plot. The basic idea of such movies is to show stunning visual and auditory effects, have characters hurtling along, mouthing dialog not meant to be coherent or even perceptible. Show em the technology, wind the characters up and get them moving-fast! Have Whoosh, whoosh, bam, bang sound effects and music to match, get a name star, and advertise the predictable and unchallenging goop as a transcendental experience.This one was interesting in places because of the visual tricks. Otherwise, I had trouble following it at times, as much because I couldn't care less about what was a dream or reality, whose dream we were in, or why this or that was happening. Explanations of the arbitrary dream rules (excuses to do various things) were the most transparent gobble-de-gook imaginable.Nothing in here had a dream like quality. The dream excuse was a gimmick to do things like play with gravity, time, etc.It is just another mindless action movie, just longer and with fancy justification. As such it is not bad-but not good.","

I know you cannot re-invent the wheel, but why-- why does everybody have a h#@$-on for everything this man does? ""The Dark Knight."" ""The Prestige."" Is anybody going to ever tell this man that he's not Stanley Kubrick? Or does he surround himself with yes-men the same way that George Lucas does? He hasn't graduated from the James Cameron School of Arrogance yet (hoping that he never attends). I didn't think that this was a bad film- it wasn't a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood drecks you see week, but it wasn't that good either. Even though Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"" started to lose its way towards the end, it was more entertaining and ""thought-provoking"" at times than this. I won't even get into the plot since so many other posters already have, and I know I'll be shot down for voicing any more criticism over this ""masterpiece,"" but I hope-- I REALLY, REALLY hope that Christopher Nolan will make another ""Memento"" again. Maybe even a sequel, but no more ""Inception""s please.","

"rraa-dd","4 April 2011","In my eyes this movie was awful. Now most people who I've told my opinion have accused me of being ""simple"" and ""not understanding it"". I believe I understood the movie very well, I appreciate Nolan's original idea and effort. It's just a shame that this idea is a piece of garbage. I enjoy intelligent movies, but there is nothing intelligent or even remotely exciting about people going into dreams, and then into dreams, and then into dreams again. The whole idea is simply ridiculous, and when Leonardo and Ariadne are in a dream together and Ariadne starts moving a huge glass door around - what on earth? Moving on to Leonardo, I cannot understand how such a poor, boring and depressive actor gets so much fame. I'm assuming this is all because of Titanic, but his role in Inception is shockingly boring and bad. And am I the only one who seems to see a pattern in Leo's movies (in both Inception and Shutter Island Leonardo's wife is dead, but he seems to think that she isn't)? Anyway, out of all the cast only Tom Hardy playing Eames is remotely likable. After seeing Cilian Murphy in some other brilliant roles (e.g. 28 Days Later) I was extremely disappointed while watching him become more miserable with every second in Inception. Leonardo's sidekick Arthur is plain annoying. I wish there had been more action in this movie other than in the scene in the snowy place. Aside from that, Inception is just a lot of talking about complete nonsense and lots of views of Leonardo's scared, confused face. Christopher Nolan made this movie way too ""intelligent"". The end result is tragic. One of the most overrated movies ever.","

In these days of BP, do we really care for an energy company vs another energy company? It's even harder to care for the characters. There isn't a Danny Oceanesque easy charm when the team is assembled. There is no single character in the team who we can gravitate towards. And the whole longing father routine doesn't really work.At least The Matrix (first movie) had a heartfelt resolution - that love is the answer. Inception...it's just cold.

Sure, there's things exploding and amazing visuals and allegations to human themes (without of course ever becoming real human emotions; allegations are much safer and more popular, because you don't have to actually feel, you can just sit back and go 'oooooh, aren't we amaaaaazing' - well, no, not really), there are characters that are never ever real people - I choose life over the dream here, really, and I hope my dreams never become as lousy as what I see here. In my dreams I feel, I touch, I smell. I dream music and books, I dream people, despair, tears. I dream violence, pain, sex, even death. I have stupid dreams in which I simply work, like I do all day. I sometimes run marathons and wake up exhausted. All these dreams are dear to me, because they are me. This film is not me, or anyone. Even my worst nightmare is preferable over this. At least I feel something there. My tiniest memory of someone I have loved is worth more than this film. A fragment of my capacity to hurt has more energy than this. I could go on, but you get the drift. I rarely give up on films, but this one I did. I quit after 45 minutes. And no, I'm not going to give it another go. As Hemingway said: 'I don't have to eat a whole bucket of snot, to know that it's snot.' One star for me trying to watch this.","

"socrates99","17 July 2010","But it's got its heart in the right place. First it's too long by at least a half-hour. Second it relies too much on frenetic activity to cover up its more grievous shortfalls. And third it's not really sci-fi, it's more a psychological thriller. But despite all that it is what it is portraying, an attempt to implant a notion, and that's highly commendable on several levels. Also a few of the scenes are both memorable and essentially flawless.The acting's all there too despite what some critics claim. DiCaprio is capable and fully invested. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is especially engaging, but the casting of Ellen Page was a near fatal mistake if you ask me. I can see why she made sense to the director and producers, but she's a drag on the movie as is Ken Watanabe who I could barely understand half the time. Still I like his acting and I can tolerate his pronunciation here. Page I don't like for some reason. Perhaps it's just too distracting and/or annoying to see her exude an almost pre-adolescent lack of experience again. If they needed an 'innocent', and I don't really agree, I would have preferred Dakota Fanning. Marion Cotillard does the exact opposite, she's worldly and knowing, but her I'd like to protect and get to know personally.I would have liked to see a slower more moody treatment of this topic. Though at least one of the chase scenes is masterful and hair-raising, the real pay dirt would have been imagining trying to enter another person's mind. In fact the separation between our minds is the bedrock on which most of our problems lay. A 'shared dream' as portrayed here would have been several notches more paradigm breaking than depicted here, I think, and that's no small flaw in this film.","

"spookyrat1","4 September 2020","Over the past decade I've seen Christopher Nolan's Inception around 5 or 6 times now. I've seen it multiple times, because I feel I must be missing something when so many others claim this is his masterpiece, whilst I can honestly take it, or leave it. I've seen all of Nolan's work and while I believe he is a truly gifted and creative film- maker, I believe Inception is seriously over rated. Here's why.As with many of his movies, technically, it can't be faulted. It looks and sounds a treat and is filled with some great sequences, just like a movie such as The Matrix Reloaded. That had some terrifically filmed sequences too, but just like Inception, wasn't a great movie ... which reminds me. Those Nolan disciples who think Inception doesn't borrow heavily from ideas floated in The Matrix are just kidding themselves. Watch The Matrix (by far the best of its trilogy, just like Batman Begins is the best of its series), then watch Inception and you'll see what I mean.My main issue with Inception is the storyline and characterisations lack balance. It's a long movie (and after repeated viewings, I have to say the time doesn't skip by) with lots of relatively important support characters, who are required to flesh out the narrative yet the only ones we ever get to know are Cobb and (versions of anyway) Mal. And I have to say that by the end of the movie, I'm totally over knowing anything more about Cobb and Mal's (surely symbolic of Malware) generally toxic relationship.Arthur seems to have some sort of partner arrangement with Cobb. Yet, even in a two and a half hour feature, nothing is ever made really clear about it. It just seems to exist and Arthur just kind of magically does stuff. Same with Ariadne, a graduate student of architecture who is recruited to construct the various dreamscapes, which are described as mazes. Where did she learn all these skills, that we never actually see her do (apart from scribble on a piece of note-paper, once or twice)? At university with Professor Miles? Same with Eames, who has some kind of mysterious ability to impersonate others, even going as far as talking like them, after he puts a bag over his head, then re-emerging to look and sound like Tom Berenger.I could go on, but I think most get the picture. If Quentin Tarantino had directed Inception we would have found out more about some of these intriguing support characters, because Quentin likes his support characters. In Inception we get zilch, except more and even more (at different sub-conscious levels) of Cobb's and Mal's seemingly never-ending story. (Like Ariadne, I 'd heard and seen enough well before the conclusion.)It's disappointing too, that for such a well produced film, Inception has too rely on some of the age old contrivances to get by. There's virtually no exposition on the extraction/inception technology that Cobb and Artur specialise in. How did they develop their skills? As always, the bad guys (or dream security protection individuals) can't shoot straight. A bunch of them with automatic weapons blast a vehicle nearly to pieces at point blank range and only Saito gets wounded? In a stair well scene later in the movie, Arthur is fired at (again with an automatic weapon) with multiple rounds from a few metres away and is left unscathed? Yusef's van, continually mega shot up and none of those sleeping people or Yusef hit? Just accept it, in the interest of supposedly brilliant film-making and move on.Inception is a multi-layered, technical marvel of a film, written and directed by a great film-maker, but this is definitely not Chris Nolan's finest cinematic moment.
Inception isn't a dud but nor is it a masterpiece. It's like a very ambitious, overlong pulp fiction piece: visually beautiful, ingenious in parts and dragging in others. I'm amazed how how inconsistant the story feels to me, even after multiple viewings and how boring and poorly written, so many of the characters in the movie are depicted as being. It's almost enough to send me to sleep. I give it a 6.5 /10.","

"Wrapper30","11 January 2011","I couldn't wait to watch this film but boy was it disappointing. It was a fantastic idea and yes it looked great. However, the main problem for me was that the characters were drawn so poorly in conjunction with the visuals that I did not really care what happened to them. I loved Momento and The Dark Knight but the crucial difference is that I cared about Guy Pearce and Christian Bale. It may be perhaps that I do not rate De Caprio but I could care less about what his predicament was. I even tried watching it 3 times to see if I was missing anything but ended up getting annoyed. Visually stunning there is no doubt and an amazing concept but emotionally shallow.","

"eastcoastguyz","1 October 2011","This movie is high energy but the problem with that is that it never stops. There is no contrast to it. High tension the entire time. No release and it wears out quickly to the point you don't even want to finish watching it. Too much repetition was included in this movie. Action sequences were too long and added nothing to the story. It needed a film editor to cut about an hour of it just to make it watchable.Then there is the plot. A plot which was thinning wrapped around all the action and special effects. You got the feeling that you were watching a computer video game and not an actual story. Far too much distraction and time spent on the lead character's personal life problem and he trying to deal with it.","

"Adorable","25 July 2010","Superficially, you know when this one winds to a close that you've just spent two and a half hours with the results of an over supportive studio giving Christopher Nolan, fresh from his huge Batman successes, way too much leeway.It's a bloated, convoluted, over-extended and ponderous film that has almost no reward in store for viewers when all's said and done. But still, even as you secretly hope it'll be the next Ishtar or Cutthroat Island, you know it's wrong to think like that. You know there was still a truckload of vision and good intentions involved in the making of Inception, and you keep thinking that maybe this is the rare summer movie to attempt delivery of an intelligent construct to generally numb and switched off audiences.The truth lies somewhere in between. Inception suffers from some factual failings that can't be denied - it's too long, for one. Then, the plot turns out surprisingly thin, so in order to fill the runtime, Nolan and Co resorted to severe repetition, so we're put through the same sequences time and again. Yet, there's no tension. You can figure out the entire affair for yourself in advance. Do not expect any twists when going into Inception, and actually the most tense moment comes right at the end, although we suspect that's because you're worried the suspense is leading into yet another scene.Then, we get to the performances. Nobody does a really bang up job here, although no one falls too short of the mark. DiCaprio delivers basically the same character he was in Blood Diamond and Body of Lies, except he doesn't yell at the people on the phone as much this time. Otherwise it's the same reluctant gun for hire routine. He plays the oddly named Dom Cobb, a specialist in extraction. That's not a dental reference, it just means he's a dream hacker, able to infiltrate the sleeping minds of others and steal valuable information. This dream world is presented as a virtual reality straight out of The Matrix, including hostile locals and bizarre physics.Cobb gets hired for one more big job by a powerful industrialist (Ken Watanabe), who needs his talents to interdict a rival family (Cillian Murphy and Pete Postlethwaite). But Cobb can't do the job alone, so he puts together an entire crew, including assistant Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), among others. The job becomes increasingly complicated, though, mostly because Cobb is haunted by his beloved wife (Marion Cotillard), who's somewhat of an antagonist, albeit a rather mundane and annoying one.What ensues exposes the failings of Inception. The narrative is just too long for it's own good, and presented in a manner that promotes repetition over ingenuity, despite the vision we mentioned before. Inception takes obvious cues from previous science fiction and surrealism entries, but at least it's honest enough to not dwell on the technicalities of just how Cobb and his posse manage to penetrate other people's dreams like that. Aside from the positive, there are mostly negatives, as you're compelled out of some basic decency to keep watching, hoping for things to take a swing in the right direction. That never happens, and Inception remains a middling exercise in over extension start to finish.Most of the effort and talent here have evidently gone towards the visual richness of the feature, which doesn't disappoint. There are some excellent effects, landscapes, costumes and settings involved, but they're not enough to distract from the overall emptiness of this movie. Were it 30 minutes shorter, then maybe Inception could have been commendable for aesthetic endeavor, but as it stands, those pluses are drowned by the lacking storytelling on show. While not a complete disaster, Inception will get you started on the path to your next movie outing real quick.","

"EvanKevelson","12 January 2021","I know I'm on the minority by going below 8. To me all Nolan films written by both him and his brother (which excludes Insomnia)...I have given 8.5/9.
I will say this film is the best interactive cast from all his films, it keeps one engaged and I don't find it to be filled with complexities because unlike other films there is no theoretical physics, or even psychology. Unless one has ""telepathy"" there's no way to know exactly what's going on inside another persons mind in imagery. Even ourselves when we dream it has to be intense, and written immediately most of us know we had a dream and the feeling but not the details of the dream.
The component of the brain that is active during REM sleep (when we dream) is also totally unrelated to memories. So geographically accessing memory, vocabulary, anything we know off hand is accessible pending a neurological disorder.
So the entire basic concept of the film has more wholes than ""The Matrix"".
So to enjoy this film you must suspend your thinking process...the other Nolan films compel the mind to try to figure out chronology why it was ordered that way and the human condition.
To me the Cob memory of Mal and his inability to let go of her is the main problem that Cob has. Assuming she ever existed or his children, because the writers dreamt up the script. There's nothing in physics or psychology that would make one try to make sense..
The only reconciliation is his conscious memories of Mal which should be harmless, and his subconscious guilt over Mal ergo her chronic attempts to sabotage him. Because his guilt stems from was she correct in the fact that they were in a dream or was he correct that they weren't. Like any untimely death or separation all humans are plagued with a level of guilt and at times turn to escapism to deal with the loss..in death visiting the grave frequently, in divorce or break ups clinging to pictures or memories of the good times, and in the more extreme Alcohol, Drugs or psychotropics. People when depressed or traumatized from loss typically have difficulty sleeping, not self loathing that creates apathy and excessive sleep.
I found the Cinematography, the Sound mixing, and the Cast as a unit phenomenal. I found it very entertaining by focusing on the attempted corporate espionage and ignoring the sleeping aspect and dream levels and viewing the process like a basketball or football game accomplishing a mission contingent on time.
I found the chemist though small in role interesting as it reminded me of an opium den...if you have time to research opium dens and the difference bt the type of pipe utilized and the composite it has the same withdrawal as opiates but it creates very vivid dream states of the past and present and people who have experienced claiming visions of a possible future based on the present and historical events.
But having a subconscious army, to see vivid geography, etc...you just have to sit back and enjoy like a Die Hard Film, or Bond.
Outside the internal conflict about Mal, I took this in as an espionage film without being bombarded by the ""Dreaming Component"". There's actually a phenomenal parody of this film and VR devices like the Oculus in 06/07 South Park.
Just by doing a search the amount of discourse and dialogue wasted trying to breakdown this film deserved a parody...As they did with GOT, and LOTR.
Summation Phenomenal action Film and fun without trying to intellectualize it.","

"paperback_wizard","16 July 2010","Christopher Nolan, the visionary director behind ""Batman Begins"", ""The Dark Knight"", and ""Memento"", has finally brought to life his project of more than twenty years. Featuring a cast of some of the world's greatest stars, both young and old, and having been filmed in locations in six different countries, ""Inception"", in the words of the L.A. Times, ""blends the best of traditional and modern film-making"".Leonardo DiCaprio headlines as Cobb, a con man who specializes in stealing people's secrets from within their very minds. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""3rd Rock from the Sun"") gives a remarkable performance as his partner in crime. Tom Hardy (""Star Trek: Nemesis""), Dileep Rao (""Avatar""), and Ellen Page (""Juno"") round out a team of highly talented ""intrusion experts"". They are hired by Ken Watanabe (""The Last Samurai"") to do the impossible: rather than steal an idea from their target's (Cillian Murphy, ""28 Days Later ..."") mind, they are to plant an idea through a process called ""inception"".There are many words to describe this movie. ""Crime drama"", ""sci-fi thriller"", ""international intrigue"", and ""mind-bending masterpiece"" all would certainly be on the list. Nolan keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very last second, barely giving you time to breathe as you try to peel the layers and decide what is real and what is illusion. There are many questions to answer as you follow the characters ever deeper into the world of dreams. The greatest questions, however, surround Cobb himself and his motives.Cobb is not your typical thief taking on ""one last job"". While his partner believes Cobb is just hoping to complete the job so he can see his children again, Page's character begins to suspect that he is seeking something more. She soon learns that Cobb is haunted by the memory of his dead wife, played by Marion Cotillard (""Public Enemies""), who does far more than simply distract him from his duties. After all, in the world of the subconscious, even the smallest distraction can take you in directions you never expected to go.Like the layers of the dream worlds the team constructs for their marks, this movie is crafted to convey one story; one single point that comes delivered wrapped in marvelous visual effects, pulse-pounding action sequences, intelligent dialogue, and even a fair amount of humor. That single point, the two words I would use to describe this movie, is ""love story"". The great mystery of ""Inception"" is the story of Cobb and his family, his wife and children, what he has done to them, and how far he will go to recover them. While most reviewers may focus on the spectacular special effects or the unique storytelling elements, I believe the central theme of ""Inception"" is the unraveling of Cobb's character. Everything else is a vehicle for this storyline.As a writer, I think this is one of the finest examples of good storytelling I've seen. As a moviegoer, I can't think of a better way to spend my money. I would recommend ""Inception"" to anyone, be they seeking an action movie, an art film, a mystery thriller, or a science-fiction wonder ride. For me, it is all those things and more; but at its heart, it is a poignant love story.(Read original review here: http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=419359136543)","

"dragokin","9 November 2014","I guess there are some drawbacks in having been around when Matrix came out and remembering the revolution it stirred up. Since then i inevitably think about it when a movie tries to tackle the boundaries of reality. In this sense, the best thing about Inception is that it came out more than a decade after Matrix, thus allowing the critical mass of new viewers to grow up and embrace it without much prior knowledge of cinema.Similar to other Christopher Nolan movies, there is little you can complain about in terms of ""fun factor"", production qualities or actors' performance. But the problems arise when we descend to a deeper level where ""big topics"" are supposedly to be discussed. There we encounter a storyline and arguments resembling a background scenario of a superior first-person video game. In fact, when you ponder about it, there is little to Inception apart from visual experience, which is the norm for blockbusters with high ratings on IMDb.","

"phatdan","26 July 2010","'Inception' has already been defined by its makers as a mixture of James Bond and 'The Matrix'. I was hoping that it would be more, and it was, but not as much as I would have liked it to be.Conceptually it was fascinating. Dreams are fascinating in themselves, and the idea of being able to enter and manipulate the sub-conscious has been around for awhile in movies: 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', 'Dreamscape', 'The Cell', and 'What Dreams May Come'. The best of these is 'The Cell', which spins a horrific tale. Yet, as a dream-concept film it is the most visually interesting because it gives us the kind of abstractions that are associated with dreams; abstractions that can make sub-conscious sense, particularly to the dreamer. 'Inception' initially depicts some dream abstractions, but conveniently overrides this by introducing the 'dream architect' whose job it is to make the dream as real as possible. As a result, as our actors jump through dream levels, in which there are four (psychology has determined there are primarily two sub-conscious levels) we observe commonsensical realities - for the most part. Although this is significant to storyline development, it unfortunately means that we are left with familiar visuals (chase scenes and shoot'em- ups) that merely differ from level to level. Soon we find ourselves watching two to four recognizable action scenarios that are implied to be transpiring simultaneously.Since this can present the possibility of confusion for the viewer, the film often becomes visually redundant and subsequently monotonous. This was the major flaw of the film, so much so that I almost nodded off. Myself. Yet, the concept of the film overrides this flaw, and much of the imagery is particularly stunning.","

"AlejandroFCC","24 January 2011","The essential problem with this movie is that it has no logic rules to abide by. And, mind you, even dreams have rules, as Freud started to hint. A rule is not ""I do what pleases me"", which is what we see throughout this movie. That's arbitrariness. Mr. Nolan should learn from hard working writers to build seriously an imaginary universe, like Tolkien, Borges, Frank Herbert, etc. Worlds with RULES. Because without rules, the writer can do whatever pleases him any moment. And as anything is possible,... who cares? And as one stops caring, one starts to get booooooored. Specially if in a supposedly imaginative story you get punished endlessly with the oh-so-hackneyed pursuits and shoot-out of faceless bad guys...

"temrok9","8 November 2014","I tried to watch Inception again on the TV one day, to give the movie a second chance, mainly since I lately discovered Tom Hardy and I wanted to see him in there.Tom Hardy was-as usual-a delight to watch, but unfortunately he was the only one not to be ridiculed by the stupid dialogues of this movie.I know Inception has many many fans, but I can' t really understand why.I suppose that many will tell me I did not understand the movie. I do not think I have such problems, especially with movies so naive and pretentious such as this total fiasco that instead of passing for masterpiece in film history should find its place in the panorama of biggest failures in film history, together with much more valuable movies that went overlooked.The way Nolan-who must take himself for a genius-heads for the dream world is superfluous, nonpoetic, mechanistic, and incoherent(he jumps from one idea to another leaving them all in suspense and we are supposed to buy that this reflects the nature of the plot).Perhaps his original idea was an interesting one but he needed a scriptwriter to make something of it.He preferred to do it all by himself, filling the story with clichés and dialogues so stupid that they are unbearable to watch and listen to.There is no philosophical background, only a pretentious plot that is supposed to mean something, and most of all it is aiming at impressing the audience, and in that it succeeded perfectly.I consider it a blasphemy to put Inception next to 2001 or Blade runner;instead I would suggest a comparison with David Cronenberg's Existenz;it's not Cronenberg's best film but it gives Nolan a lesson what messing with another reality means.Finally, I understand that these views I expose here are about to be the target of attack by many devoted fans.I can not but accept this position.PS. I am heading for Intersterlar one of these days, I never learn;I already read people are in love with this movie too.I hope I fall in love too, but I have great reservations as I do not trust the director at all!I'll be back, however, with another review, since I've decided to fight for what I consider right these days(and to support great films I still have the pleasure to watch,like- very recently- the Judge and the Drop)","

Q: I did pay attention and still didn't get it maybe I missed somethingA: Read through the entire FAQ section of IMDb for the movie.---I rest my case (the above is a word-for-word excerpt from the film's IMDb message board - in case you were wondering).Possibly something like 90% of what is posted about Nolan's movies in the IMDb forum are obvious and desperate fanboys' attempts at explaining what each movie was really all about.They go to great lengths in trying to reason everyone why what seemed like plot holes weren't actually plot holes at all. Or what seemed like bad writing, directing, acting etc., was actually outstanding. It's like an engineer telling us when we complain about a p.o.s. technical gadget we just bought not working the way it's supposed to that it is actually quite easy to use: ""Here let me show you. First you press here. Then you open the menu. No, not that menu, the other menu. Then you"" ad infinitum.

"Attila_the_gorilla","10 November 2010","Not much more to add really. I managed to watch this farce for about half an hour, I desperately wanted to give it a chance, but every passing minute is such an insult to my intelligence that I cannot carry on. Then I tried again to continue, because I thought it's not fair to rate a movie without watching it to the end. But then again, I'm not a masochist.This film is the perfect example of how movie success depends hardly on movie quality, but almost solely on marketing. The same happened with the Matrix a few years back. Farcical setting, totally unrealistic story, but great marketing: Box office success.You probably already know the deal, unfortunately I was unsuspecting before I tried to watch it: Getting into other people's dreams, creating a believable world in the dream where multiple dreamers can interact with each other, and in this way, collect important information from the mark. Of course the dreams also have dreams within, and it's hard to know what is real and when your're dreaming.Whatever. No idea why anyone would WANT to watch this, other than because of the hype. But the hype has very little to do with the quality of the film.This film's whole focus is on the farcical notion of creating dreams for people, and especially, interacting with other characters in the dream who are dreaming the exact same dream. If the film were not so consumed by this outragous technicality, and it had some character and heart, some sort of purpose, I could probably let slip the ridiculousness of the whole theme. I have been known to enjoy the odd sci-fi. But it lacks any heart, all it does is try to look smart.I find it grossly unfair that this junk rates above 9 on IMDb. However, my rating of 2 is not because I want to bring the total down, it is rather what I think the realistic rating is. And that 2 is a very generous score.","

"st-shot","16 August 2010","One has to look no further than at this two and one half hour bag of hot air to understand why American film is on life support. In what would have made for an absorbing thirty minute Twilight Zone episode in the mid sixties has been (through the wonder of technology) turned into a flashy and noisy blockbuster as director Chris Nolan applies lipstick to this pig by the bucket. Cobb (Leonard DiCaprio) is a dream stealer in a land and time not far from now. He's particularly valuable to corporations keen on getting an edge on competitors but now in order to go legit and see his kiddies again he must do the reverse. Impossible you say, not in Chris Nolan's fantasy land of computer generated gimmickry and circuitous dialog.Inception's slick dishonesty lies in the parallel universe of the real and unreal worlds Nolan creates in an attempt to humanize its disheveled super hero by giving it a patina of reality and generate sympathy for Cobb. But Cobb along with everyone else acts like a stilted automaton (or Joe Friday from Dragnet) and while it try's redistributing its weight to give balance to the money shots (you know the fireworks) it comes across mawkish and syrupy. The premise itself is hashed and rehashed ad nauseum and so much one gets the idea that the producers are not only attempting to blind with shock and awe but confuse you with non-sequitors in hopes of successfully cloning you to buy another ticket.Even in the real world it is based Inception remains a fairy tale working off the borderless freedom of fantasy where things don't have to be logical just convenient. Nolan was far more successful in bringing the fantasy reality factor closer together in Insomnia and Memento. There was a grittier tension in these low budgets that Nolan has lost since hitting the big time and having at his disposal a huge budget for all star casts ( mostly wasted in minor roles here) and exotic locales to play out his ideas. These productions (Batmans plus The Prestige) may spare no expense but they lack soul and usually flounder mid way.While the blame can be clearly affixed to the the shoulders of writer, producer, director Nolan I would be remiss not to acknowledge cinematographer Wally Pfister's murky and dull compositions and Hans Zimmers relentless music score which plays like a leaky faucet throughout the entire film. Like an IV it attempts to transfuse suspense into the plot with an annoying undercurrent and the occasional crash of brass.","

"CuriosityKilledShawn","24 July 2010","After all the hype and marketing that built up before the release of this film I decided to leave it a week before seeing it. Sitting in a crowded cinema with hundreds of wannabe intellectuals who will immediately, and loudly, begin to dissect the film as soon as the credits roll doesn't appeal to me.I've heard that Inception is a ""mindf***"" and a film that requires more than one viewing to fully understand. Well, I never found it to be that way. Not that I am showing off, but I found it rather straight-forward in the sense that it goes from A-Z, but the entire alphabet in-between is completely jumbled and anyone the slightest bit attentive can put it in the right order rather easily.Is it well made and flawlessly shot? Definitely! I think that Wally Pfister is long overdue for an Oscar and his cinematography on this film should secure him that award. The acting, while competent, left me cold though. I never really felt anything for the characters, they were far too distant and deadly serious. It reminded me of the Matrix (a very similar film) with the heavy exposition and surreal physics. Inception is all about spectacle and epic visuals. That's not a real criticism though. The scope and sights are worth the price of a ticket alone.The dream manipulation theme has been around for decades and it didn't impress me as anything breathtakingly new. Hans Zimmer borrows from his own Dark Knight score a bit too liberally, though there are some ingenious sounds in there. So...while many, many people are praising this film to the point of possible mass-hysteria I have to point out that there isn't THAT much original about it.A bold, confident work, and consistently gripping, but no one will blame you if you have a feeling of deja vu. Even the final shot is similar to the ending of a certain Paul Verhoeven film from 1990. Is it a dream or is it reality? It's been done before.If you want a film that truly messes with your head check-out David Lynch's Inland Empire or Lost Highway.","

"gunnar_zero-1","2 June 2011","I must admit that the first time I saw Inception, I was surprised, it is after all a complex movie, however after repeated views I've realized that even though complex, it is not focused at all.By now, most of the people reading this review already saw the movie and as the high rating on IMDb reveals, most of the readers liked the movie. And in all honesty the first time or two times I saw it I liked it too, but as I said before repeated views, reveal the incoherent, pretentious, even ridiculous defects of the movie.The main one (and my biggest complaint) being the ''main plot'' of the movie, completely amoral, simple and without depth nor real development. There is no reason at all for the viewer to root for the main cast, when they are ruining one guy's life just or the sake of helping other to make more money. The ''heroes'' are anti-heroes or just true villains, they are thieves, criminals and the only redeeming quality, that is Cob's (DiCaprio's character) wish to see his children again, is in the end just a dream, an illusion. I don't think that every movie should have a heavy load of morals, however including true redeeming qualities adds depth and layers to the script and the characters, here we have 1 dimensional characters that spit lines of dialog without truly adding something to the plot, just for the sake of making the ''Heist Movie'' more interesting. And one last thing, shame on you mister Nolan for bringing such great actors like Tom Berenger and especially Michael Caine to recite 3 lines in the entire movie, shame on you.1/10 And that's because I cannot put a 0 on it. Yes the technical aspects of the movie are superb, however not even that saves this movie, unlike Avatar, that the visuals, do carry the whole movie.","

"adlion944","17 November 2010","Inception is right up my alley. I was expecting a thinking person's thriller with a bit of sci fi. C Nolan is well known - I loved the Dark Knight and Batman Begins. He's quality and tells a slow boiling story that pays off a concept. But whew, Inception... wow what a stinker.There's no question that this production staff and the cast took this project and themselves very seriously. It oozes production values. Too bad it lost me in the first 10 minute when I had no idea what was happening. And not in a good way, like other thrillers. I had absolutely no desire to understand the clap-trap these unlikeable characters were spouting. The kid from Third Rock, wow he thinks he's quite the bad boy. Fail.Anyway, instead of something that held my interest, this movie simply frustrated me. Inception is a ponderous, self-important, vacuous movie. It's empty, all presentation, no flavor. It makes no sense and I didn't even want to keep straining to figure it out. It doesn't unfold like ""The Game"" where you're dying to know how it comes out, clue by clue. I even stuck with Shutter Island and didn't really like that one, but it was way, way, way better than this movie. And it's not because I don't have patience for high-concept. It's not ambiguous or thought-provoking it just ends.Still, I would recommend others see this film and judge for themselves. Others seem to find this movie very intense and deep. I just don't get it. Personal preference, but there are quite a few like me where metaphysical pseudo sci-fi speeches, and lots of rules about what you can and can't do are just frustrating and not a nice evening's entertainment. I think I'll go watch The Game or Matrix again. It's been a while and I need to get the sour taste of this movie out of my mouth.","

"namashi_1","16 July 2010","Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' is amongst the Best Films Ever Made! Usually, films have their share of minuses and flaws... surprise, surprise, surprise, 'Inception' is the first film since 'The Shawshank Redemption' that stabs words like ""Flaw"" and ""Minus""! Nolan's lucid dream is brought to life with 'Inception'. What happens when you enter the World of Dreams and it's motives, is so unusual, so interesting, so gripping and so amazing... that your left asking for more. By now, you know what this Masterstorke is about, but believe me... you have no idea what's in store for you! 'Inception' grabs your attention from the very start, and as mentioned before, leaves you awe-struck. And yes, 'Inception' packs in THE Best Climax Ever! It's simply astounding!!Nolan makes his careers best film in 'Inception'. His screenplay is EPIC, and his direction should land him an Academy-Award for Best Director! Wally Pfister's cinematography is sure to compliment him with numerous awards in the coming time. Music by Hans Zimmer, as always, is perfect.Each and Every Actor excels over-here: Leonardo DiCaprio takes the lead and steals the show. The star-actor becomes Dom Cobb, and delivers a memorable performance. Ellen Page is fantastic. Marion Cotillard is magnificent. Michael Caine, in a brief role, is flawless. Tom Hardy is very good, this is his best performance to date. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gets a role of a lifetime, and he sinks his teeth into it. Ken Watanabe is stylish, while Cillian Murphy is highly efficient. Tom Berenger is perfect. Dileep Rao is good.On the whole, Nolan's 'Inception' is worth your time and money. Let me put it this way: ""If your a Cinema-Fan, than watching 'Inception' is a must""! Two Big Thumbs Up!","

"whatch-17931","12 October 2020","I'm sure I'll be considered ""not getting it"" for not fawning over this movie, but the thing to ""get"" seems to be the multiplication of the different dream levels' time rates. I think it's an incredibly dubious notion, but I'm pretty sure I got it.I can live with the dream machine as a plot device. I'm considerably less forgiving of using the long discredited pseudoscience that we only use a fraction of our brain. There's a term for using your whole brain at once and that term is 'seizure.'But the dreams are just so boring. Snow skiing? After the billboards for the film and the training sequence with very neat visuals and ideas, snow skiing? And the train thing? And the rotating hall? All of this was done long before in 007, Star Trek and 2001: A Space Odyssey.To me, this movie is the Emperor's New Clothes. Sure, if you hadn't seen the older stuff, it might seem new.And I'm no Nolan hater. I really like Interstellar and Memento. Both those truly had groundbreaking parts, at least for widely released material. Memento had the ""reverse"" time thing.Interstellar had the breathtaking and accurate depictions of both a back hole and a wormhole, plus relativistic time effects of dealing with massive gravity wells. That's actual brainy stuff for a feature. Inception depicted dreams duller than the decades old Dreamscape-- and many many others.","

"Chris-742","31 December 2010","This movie has several dazzling special effects. But other than that, what is there to say. Well, mainly....YAWN. Many comedy movies are just sketches strung together with the barest of threads to hold the plot together. Inception does the same thing for action movies, the action sequences are held together with a plot that pretends to be complicated, but in reality is wafer thin and yet full of holes that you could put Incepton's entire budget for special effects into each one of them. Inceptions virtual world does not impress because it is a work of beauty without any connection with dreams at all. Take away the special effects and you are left with substandard, uninspired acting and a boring movie.","

"electrifier4","18 April 2011","I would have honestly given the movie a 7 but the current rating is very undeserving and I had no choice but to make the least contribution I could make to it. The writer/director of Inception thought if maybe they pretended to have a very complex plot and great special effects, the audience would not realize how pointless the whole story is. The audience were like; ""OH! Such a complex plot! A Genius!! A Masterpiece!!"" The first hour and a half all they do is explain the whole inception system without moving the plot forward. I am sure most of the audience didn't get what the movie was about but they pretended so they would not look stupid. And Christopher Nolan is going;""I don't really think of films in terms of light and dark...blah blah blah! I am a genius! blah blah blah! ...thriller that takes place in the mind...blah blah blah! I am a genius! blah blah blah!"" The intention of the film clearly reflected on itself. The point was not to entertain audience but rather it was a show-off of what artistic capability the director/writer possesses. It tried to point out the fact what a movie genius Christopher Nolan is. I mean I love this guy. The Prestige was great and so was the Dark Knight. But Inception was really showing off. Look at Kick-Ass, Watchmen and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. They were complete honest movies. Their intentions were clean and they reflected in the movie. They were meant for pure entertainment and that's what we got. On the other hand Inception was trying too hard. I could really point the fact on how the intentions of the movie was showing off but I would rather suggest the audience to watch the movie once again. They said the movie was very unpredictable. Suppose there is a man chopping onions in the movie and suddenly the chopped onions turned into a chicken. Now would that be predictable? They might say Cobb's wife living with him till old age in the dream was unpredictable. Are you serious!! How come you haven't seen that one coming!! It was so obvious! It is only the fact the way it was dramatized that made it seem unpredictable and shocking. Top 10 in the IMDb chart!!! Are you kidding me!!","

"JohnSeal","17 July 2010","Whilst Christopher Nolan's Inception is superior in almost all respects to his previous film, The Dark Knight, it's still a portentous, pretentious concept in search of a story. Whilst that concept is a clever one, the film is (as are all Nolan features) seriously over-plotted and far too long, with one-dimensional cardboard characters slotted into position to help prove the director's point about the malleability of reality.It's impossible to give a damn about any of the people involved, and the 'corporate espionage' angle generates little more than a shrug of disinterest. Who cares whether or not some fictional corporation gets broken up or not? Leonardo diCaprio does his best to bring some emotional weight to the table, but Nolan's screenplay doesn't have much room for genuine feeling. There are good performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy, but Ellen Page is atrocious (how long can the woman-in-the-body of a thirteen-year old girl schtick work?), whilst Marion Cottilard is little better. And whoever came up with the idea of using Edith Piaf's Non je ne Regrette Rien as a triggering device should have been fired. Of course, it was probably Mr. Nolan himself.Inception is not a complete waste of time, and it's nice to see a summer blockbuster rely less on explosions and more on matters of the heart and mind, but it's far from a must-see.","

"jjolla888","15 April 2013","Christopher Nolan burst to stardom with the stunningly good, low-budget Memento. Since then, his hubris has got the better of him, and the more money he has to spend on movies the worse they become.Inception is all splash - yet positively awful. It is classic blockbuster in the sense that all critics were bought off with its excessive promotional budget. How every single critic gave this rubbish maximum ratings can only be explained by a bribe (do the math: as an example, a $20M budget to buy off all of ~500 critics is about $40,000 per reviewer. The difference between a 2-star and a 4-star rating will guarantee to translate to much more than $20M).All huge-budget blockbusters are the same. This one has reached the zenith of promotional ingenuity.The movie is not complex as many dodos would believe. It is boringly slow and attempts to be convoluted just so you can be duped into thinking it is deep and meaningful. The best part of the film is the last 10 seconds - the only true suspense happens in these few moments. Ironically I got pleasure from seeing my partner fall asleep during the last hour : at the end of the movie I was very curious to know if she remembered her dream ...","

"TheThirdWoman84","6 November 2011","Seriously? Mesmerizing? Fantastic? Genius? No.I was pretty excited about this film after all the hype, and I feel massively let down. The plot was overly drawn out and repetitive, and there was an over-reliance on action, with massive portions of the plot being taken up by filler scenes of silly shoot-outs and car chases.Christopher Nolan has given this film a superficial sheen of meaningfulness, with the admittedly astounding visuals covering for a plot so full of holes it's almost falling apart. Why are Dom and Mal shown as having grown old and grey together in limbo when they are also shown laying their head on train lines to escape limbo as 30-somethings? Why does the incessant music come to dominate the film, making every scene feel climactic, which is actually detrimental to the final climax? In a similar manner to the way in which the Wachowski brothers took the brilliant writings of Baudrillard and completely mangled them beyond all meaning in The Matrix, Nolan has taken a great idea and turned it into a teenage boy's shoot-em-up action fantasy. People might watch it and think ""Wow, that's really deep"". No, it's not. It has the appearance of being deep and meaningful when in fact it's just a shallow action film.I'm sure people will read this review and think ""she just doesn't get it"". The problem is that I do it get. Unfortunately there's just not a lot to get.","

"TheTrexr","4 January 2011","Alright, so here's the thing; yes, it was cool that there was all that complexity. Yes, it was cool that there were so many layers of thought both on screen and off to what was going on. Yes, it was cool that Chris Nolan managed to make something unique and fairly independent in just one movie that was complex enough to account for a whole trilogy of movies in almost any other genre. But here's the thing; it had some rather alarming logical leaps that I could not get over.1.The Projections; Okay, so the things that inhabit the streets of the person's subconscious are manifestations of the various components of their brain as evidenced by the fact that when the characters need to find something out about the dreamer's perception of someone else they just follow that manifestation in the dream. Makes sense, because that thought does what the dreamer thinks it would do, not what the real person would do. When I saw that I went 'wow, that makes sense! Clever!', but then towards the end of the movie they say 'nevermind, they're just projections; they don't actually mean anything, and parts of their minds aren't being killed.' That was a little too convenient for my liking.2.The Totems; WHY doesn't the top fall over in the dream world? WHY does it keep spinning perpetually? Everything else obeys the laws of basic physics, so why wouldn't that? That was probably the dumbest thing I've seen in a movie this year; there wasn't even an attempt made to explain it. I can honestly say this was just as bad as 'only a prime can kill a prime' in Trasformers 2.3. The Architect/Dreamer Relationship; Why can only the architect choose the world they enter? And why is the only person who 'projects' characters into this world the person that's 'the dreamer'? They are ALL dreaming, every single one of them, so they should ALL be both altering the world they're in and the characters in it. And why can't the projections do anything cooler than be normal guys with guns? If I detected intruders in my mind I'd summon a nuke or Godzilla or Optimus Prime to get them out, not boring henchman who probably wouldn't be able to get the job done anyways.4. The Script, and it's supposed 'surprises' I felt kind of talked down to when they honestly expected it to be a surprise when you discovered that Molly's death was as a result of Cobb's previous inception. If ANYONE made it through that movie without figuring that out they deserve to be jettisoned into the sun for their stupidity. I caught on the moment he mentioned that inception was possible.5. Waking Up/Dying in the Dream When you die in the dream world you come back up a level towards consciousness, as evidenced by the fact that they wake up when they get shot in the face in the first scene. But wait! When they die in the dream you actually go down to limbo as evidenced by that happening to the oriental guy, which sucks because that's where it's just 'pure subconscious' and you wake up a vegetable. But wait! You actually aren't in an endless limbo because Cobb and Molly went there once, but you still wake up a vegetable. But wait! You actually don't wake up a vegetable because Cobb and Molly didn't when they killed themselves on the train tracks. But limbo is still bad.......right? Because you can't get out without becoming mentally handicapped, but if you can kill yourself to get out at any time just like a normal dream then why is limbo even bad? And isn't inertia supposed to wake you up? Technically the van falling off the bridge should have woken them up, or even it rolling, not it hitting the water. If the force of hitting the water is what woke them up, then shouldn't anything like a slap to the face do it? In the end the movie suffered from the EXACT same things The Dark Knight did, and that is Chris Nolan's conflicting desires to make something believable and for sensationalism, and both cancelling out the other. If you wanted to compare it to the other obvious similar franchise,The Matrix actually is believable. Oh, yeah, now that I think of the matrix, how does a tiny needle plugged into their wrist plug them into an alternate reality in Inception? The base of the skull made sense, this is just silly. People keep saying this is the next Matrix, but the difference here is that literally twenty views later everything in the Matrix STILL makes sense, and I punched holes in this latest Leonardo Decrapio movie in one sitting. Pathetic.","

"Healing_Process","1 August 2010","Let me first by saying Inception skin deep is a 10/10 and is beautiful. But deep within the shell of hype is a movie that is still good but lacking at the same time. To all the people Who ultimately love the movie I see reviews like,""Couldn't wait to see this"" ""Masterpiece?"" ""Insanely Intelligent"" which just makes the movie reviewer seem very naive. To all the people who ultimately hate the movie, they always say things like ""I hate Christopher Nolan"" ""This movie is a ***** waste of time"" etc. Which then makes me believe that those people just have something against Christopher Nolan.In my opinion I saw the movie as nothing but a Hollywood movie. It was mildly entertaining and the cast was just a big name with no giant steps in their acting skills. I saw no hard acting parts besides them being themselves trying to talk about ""logical things"".The Reason this movie was mildly entertaining was due to the fact that the storyline wasn't as fresh as people say it was. The editing also seemed jumbled. Trying to cram multiple dreams in one instance in an unorthodox manner in a poorly executed way makes the movie just look even more pretentious. I have seen too many movies that skew the whole concept of reality and dreams and quite frankly this one didn't make me think too hard. Did they have to use pretty CGI? Did they have to have giant gun battles? No.... Of course this movie could of been way better if it wasn't ""Hollywoodized"" and dumbed down to make everyone interested in the action and CGI. Don't forget the decreased amount of talking about things that really needed to be talked about in order to avoid plot holes. Instead they just kept explaining the concept in a repetitious measure and never explained things in depth. Like for instance, the machine the Architect created. (""Architect"" Matrix again) I hate to compare, like most people, but I would have to say that matrix (the first) beats this. The matrix created a universe aside from a concept and also had a foundation to where something originated. In this movie they treated everything so calmly yet everything was so insignificant due to everything being a dream? (Sound confusing and irrational? Tell me about it) What you know and who you know is insignificant and the movie is a continuous Dream, in a Dream, in a Dream that was just piled together to make me think. Is this a Dream? That isn't very exciting to me. I am not over thinking. I am just not chasing a very uninteresting rabbit down a hole.I have seen it once, it was fun, its in the past. It has a less than 20% chance of me buying it on DVD when it comes out and it will soon be forgotten by me. There are more movies out there that blow my mind with their concepts then this one did. It was just a fancy effect, semi action, simple concept movie.","

"m_antrim1","30 July 2010","We went to see this movie at an IMAX theater. After reading the initial reviews about the special effects and the cinematography, and seeing all of the trailers and special shorts on the film, this seemed like a sound choice. What an absolute waste of money! After reading the other user reviews, I can't help but wonder if we didn't watch a completely different film. All science fiction films require a suspense of reality as they are based on a future time, feature incredible technology which is currently beyond our reach, etc. Given that, most films try to put this aspect into some kind of context which makes the central premise believable or possible. Not in this case. This film's plot vehicle is something called is 'shared dreaming,' through which a third-party can access your dreams and unlock information you are keeping secret. It is somehow done by connecting the dreamers up to a devices contained in stylish briefcases and then - POW - they are in an apparent instant REM state, all connected together and journeying off in their dream world. Huh? It's just thrown out there and the audience is expected to just absorb the concept, accept it and move on to be wowed by all the special effects. A murmur of 'I don't get it' was heard throughout the theater I was in.Early in the film Dicaprio approaches a student played by Ellen Page, who is a student of his old professor and asks her to be an 'architect' and design his dream environments for him. The environments must have mazes and paradoxes. Now, most folks when presented with such a concept would be calling the nut house on a guy like Dicaprio, but Page's character just accepts the whole thing and dives in, having a whee of a time with the environment she creates, bending it and reforming it in visually impressive ways. There is no attempt, however, to sell this whole thing to the audience and it just doesn't work in any sort of context. As the team descends through layers of 'levels' of dreams, the whole thing just becomes more moronic and boring. Great visuals, lots of action, but it all just seems pointless.I would put this down as one of the worst movies I've ever seem. Beautifully shot, but with an empty, stupid plot.","

"Almultimavenger","12 March 2023","I didn't expect what's called one of the best movies to be one of the most unoriginal digital mess I've seen. Inception is a 2010 science fiction action thriller (more accurately, it's supposed to be one) created by the king of convolutedness and confusion Christopher Nolan. If you're wondering what it's like to watch a two hour film with zero emotion this would be one such example, cause nothing about the film is coherent, it's just a two hour compilation of random insignificant one dimensional characters engaging in pointless car chases and gun fights.. Upon reading Wikipedia this is what I got, two agents named Arthur and Cobb use technology to infiltrate dreams to extract thoughts and information, in the film they try implant a thought into a businessman in order to shut down his company, which is supposed to be a hard task.Straight to the point and much to the polarized reaction of the film's fans, the movie was bad. Nothing about it is understandable, there's no direction, story, purpose, uniqueness, nothing. Nolan only has two good movies and they were still nothing special and his work usually makes extreme confusion out of the simplest ideas. That's not a bad thing if it's handled properly but it isn't, it ends up boring you. Nothing about Inception made sense, the characters and their personalities were flat, you'll watch it without any idea of what's going on, what the story is, and just sit their confused like you're watching a quantum physics lecture. I intend to see it again but I wouldn't watch this for entertainment, it's not entertaining or informative, it's just dull, boring, flat, and convoluted. There's little I can say about it cause it offers nothing unique, media works like Doctor Who and Smile make a much better execution of this ""trapped in dreams"" premise so I'd recommend watching them. If this is the best that Hollywood has to offer in the eyes of the people then I wouldn't trust Hollywood to write well, but it certainly isn't. This is is a film you're better off skipping, you're better off watching science-fiction masterpieces like Avatar, the MCU, and Jurassic World.","

That sadly is all, its an overblown mess of a movie with no place for a connection to the films characters.
A collection of choreographed fight scenes connected by dream science mumbo jumbo and accompanied by a bombastic score does not make an interesting movie.

There is absolutely no payoff by the end of the film because we do not care about any of these characters. If it were not for the genius score, this could easily be the worst waste of time I have had in a movie theater in years.I see there is some controversy and speculation as to where all the rave reviews are coming from.

And of course, when it comes to action, it is all show just like any good action movie. In fact, Inception is nothing but an action movie wrapped in some philosophical stuff about dreams. There is, of course, real ingenuity in some of the action scenes especially those place in a zero gravity situation. Nolan was simply lucky in having an action movie released during a time when there wasn't really much competition and audiences were clearly hungry for something better. Nolan was even luckier having Hans Zimmer for Mr. Zimmer keeps suspense alive during the many long scenes of exposition. The real theatrical breakthrough lies in the film's using the telling part (hugely aided by Hans' music) to sustain interest and some suspense which are then fulfilled in the showing part. It is quite amazing that the film did so well at the BO; there are really no characters to sympathize with or to particularly care about. As to plot, the payoff for the many pangs of Cobb's conscience is indeed worthwhile. While many seem to think the film will have considerable longevity, it will fade quite quickly when considered outside of its lucky time slot.","

"Fields201","5 August 2010","Inception was not that great of a movie. There. I said it. I can't believe so many people from the reviews of IMDb.com to my closest friends walking out of this saying this was a great film. Maybe that was my problem. I went into this film thinking this was going to be great but that just wasn't the case. I wasn't involved with the story.And story was the film's main selling point. Yeah, there's the visuals, yeah. They are spectacular, I won't lie. I love how the world moves with their minds and how they were able to get the actors to interact to an otherwise unusual world. And normally the effects is Hollywood's only strength, to draw their audience in with spectacular CGI. No, Inception wants to engross you into it's story.Many were lost. I just did not care.The story mostly revolves around dreams. It's like plugging into the Matrix and the Avatar. Now that I think of it, maybe that's what audiences like. Maybe the average moviegoer likes characters who become something that isn't themselves. Maybe they like characters who are strapped in to a bed or some sort, plugged into something, and then they are subjected into a different world where they have to fight to survive.But if this idea is what Hollywood is catching onto then believe me, it will get old fast. People would look back on this and wonder why audiences liked this in the first place. Inception is not one of those films that will be remembered with some of the greats, especially Nolan's own Batman films. It just doesn't have that kind of impact. Visually, it's stunning, but storywise, no.But hey, if it's everyone's cup of tea.","

"burtofprey-1","2 December 2010","I didn't like anything about this movie and I don't understand why people rate it high. Why do people lately anyway like movies that are inarticulate? The dreams were stupid and the characters too. Who cares anyway what happens in this film? Usually I can appreciate sci fi movies like Solaris. They are great to me and I enjoy the mystery and the futuristic scenery. But sadly Inception is pretentious and empty. I have to admit, I could only watch it for 1 hour, then I had to leave because it was a waste of my time, I rather do nothing actually. All along the movie the actors kept explaining things, and that killed the integral. I don't know why a wonderful actor like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has done some very artistic independent movies, wants to play this cardboard man? Leonardo diCaprio in Shutter Island will always be one of my favorite parts ever. You know what? It's that ""Look at me I'm very important"" style of acting that I dislike with Inception. It takes itself way too serious while the plot is no more than a thumbed B comic.","

"croetoan","5 August 2010","The Not-Too-Revealing-Summary: Inception is a thought-provoking action movie that is best tagged with keywords like ""con-men,"" ""corporate espionage,"" ""psychological thriller"" or even ""philosophy.""The-Not-Too-Revealing-Review: Inception takes a very simple - and very traditional - genre and fashions it around a complicated idea. The movie is truly a work of art - in a positive sense as much as in a pejorative sense. Director Christopher Nolan takes a fairly complicated notion and unravels it for the audience in such a way as to entertain visually and provoke thoughtfully. The movie was, however, art for art's sake. It was a demonstration: the goal was not to amaze, thrill, or surprise but to bewilder. It was a presentation of a mental knot and then the step-by-step exhibition of how one would disentangle it. In this regard the movie was a success. Some of my many grievances (and they were many) against the film: The action scenes were quite obviously padding for the core of the film. Most of the scenes were shot in indoor, extremely confined situations - and though stylish - they were not the strikingly visual scenes I had hoped for. The big, outdoor, scenes where this big budget film had a chance to truly impress failed completely. The fight scenes where the movie had the opportunity to provide some iconic segment - looked like men hoisted in the air with wires. Between two of Nolan's other works - Memento and the Dark Knight - Inception was more Memento. The attention to detail present in the Dark Knight made it into Inception - but only into the unraveling of Nolan's idea. The many filler scenes lacked this consideration and left the film with a duality of wonderfully thought-through details interspersed with inanity.Some other odds and ends: Tip of the hat to Nolan for leaving some things unexplained. It is unclear if this is truly present day or some time in the future and the director rightly leaves that for the audience to decide for themselves. Explanations for the mechanisms of the technology are left alone - and for the better. I could not have told you who Tom Hardy was before this film but after this performance I look forward to whatever it is he may do next. I hope Nolan credits a certain 1999 film (whose title I shall not mention so I do not spoil this movie for anyone else). The relationship goes far beyond similarity or inspiration. Nolan took it further (with a budget of over $130 million more) but it is bothersome to see Inception heralded for ""originality."" Overall I cannot recommend this film. It was neither enjoyable nor entertaining to watch. I can respect the skill it takes for someone to make a house of cards but in the end I have no real desire to stare at a house of cards.","

"mikethevike","5 January 2011","I was really looking forward to watching this movie after all the positive reviews, the incredibly high IMDb rating and the raving of several friends who had seen it.I will point out that I liked The Matrix, Memento, Batman Begins and the Dark Knight (although this last movie is quite overrated on IMDb). I also understood the plot of Inception from the start and never had any trouble following what was happening so it's not that I didn't ""get it"".Inception is NOT a great movie and not even a very good one. The plot is not very clever or inventive contrary to what many IMDb raters have suggested and there are no interesting or surprising twists. The characters are poorly developed and, as the viewer, I didn't really care what happened to them. There are no true ""bad guys"" to root against (all the bad guys are just ""bad"" dreams) and there is no real desire to see the ""good guys"" succeed because the object of the entire plot seems irrelevant (implant a thought in some guy's head so he will break up his father's corporation... I kid you not!). The fact that everything happens in dreams removes the sense of danger and risk from all the action and makes it seem like a pointless video game, which is what several of the dreams appear to be anyway... unimaginative and repetitive. Are all Nolan's dreams just ""shoot'em up"" video games? The attack of the hospital/mountain fortress was as bad as it gets... looked like a CGI sequence from Medal of Honor/Call of Duty.It was also infuriating to me that the rules of the dream universes are inconsistent. Creating an imaginary situation where normal rules don't apply is OK as long as the alternate universe functions according to logical rules, but in this movie the rules are constantly bent to accommodate the needs of the director.A few examples: The top is supposed to be an indication to Mal that she is in ""her own dream"" if the top spins forever because she has made it that way... If she is in someone else's dream then the top will topple since they don't know that in her dreams the top spins forever. So how does that indicate to Dom/the viewer that he is/is not in a dream/reality in the end scene?... but wow, that is sooo deep.How did finding the top in the safe allow Dom to ""incept"" Mal with the idea that she was in a dream and needed to return to reality? No explanation... but wow, that is sooo deep.In dream No.1 the van falls off the bridge causing weightlessness in dream No.2 - meaning that non-physical events (it's a dream) of a certain kind(?) carry through between dream layers. In dream No.2 the sleeping characters become weightless but somehow this state does not carry through to layer No.3 and No.4... but it's a dream anyway so who cares if it makes sense?Why do you need a ""kick"" in each layer to wake up the characters? if weightlessness carries through the layers the ""kick"" would logically also carry through... If there was some logic to the rule wouldn't it be that only actual physical events in the real world carry through to the dreams? But in your dream you are aware that there is another reality - which is really another dream - so you dream that can feel the effects of the other dream although you are asleep and unaware of what's going on... but wow, that is sooo deep.If a character is asleep in the first layer of a dream he does not know what is happening to him after he has fallen asleep thus would have no reason to dream that he is becoming weightless in layer two as he sleeps through the falling van dream... but wow, that is sooo deep.Since the wake-up ""kicks"" are supposed to come through sensation in the inner ear and the ""kicks"" are not real but dreams, then I have to conclude that the inner ear must ""dream"" that it senses the imaginary kicks, which makes no sense at all... but wow, that is sooo deep. So as you analyze the logic behind the dream rules you must conclude that the entire movie is just a dream (a nightmare) where no logic applies or that the ""dream rules"" are just nonsense and the whole movie is a pretext for stringing together a bunch of unrelated ""cool"" action sequences and special effects to make a massive Hollywood ""pseudo-intellectual"" blockbuster junk movie. This movie was an even the greater disappointment considering that I was anticipating something better than ""The Matrix"" or ""The Sixth Sense"". The IMDb rating of 9+ is incomprehensible, this should rate in the 6.0-7.0 range. The rating must reflect a large number of users getting confused and rating it as a video game.As for those who say the number of positive votes/reviews indicate it is a great movie I think you could likewise argue for McDonald's being the best food in the world.I rated it a very harsh 1.0 only to help bring the IMDb rating back to earth. It is however a very mediocre movie.","

"michael-561-692892","2 January 2020","I read all these reviews stating how this is the most intellectual movie ever made. I wonder if that's because the people writing those reviews are egotistical sociopaths.There's nothing intellectual about the idea of a dream within a dream within a dream. The premise is simple. The soundtrack has to be the most complicated thing about this mess.Inception is a bait and switch film focused on people hired to trick a guy into ripping apart his fathers company so that it's largest competitor wins. They do this by sedating the scarecrow from batman in a series of dreams within dreams to convince him he's dreaming. The van they all are passed out in gets attacked the entire time to create some suspense. Then jack from titanic lives forever in a dream.I'd rather watch Kevin hart implode his career. Maybe that's what I'll watch next on Netflix. His documentary and this film have equally annoying soundtracks. At least I know what I'm going into... a waste of time, just like inception. Now you won't be able to get my opinion out of your head. Waste of time. Inception.","

Just a mash of silly ideas wrapped around compulsory CGI with hopelessly miscast actors who looked liked they just walked off the set of an after school special.Apart from the plagiarized idea of this dream infiltration business, the storyline never rose above the grade of an 80's Bond flick. Not a likable or non cookie cutter character on screen and the constant drawn out exposition got seriously annoying even after a short while.I frankly don't think it's an exaggeration when I say that I've seen episodes of the Simpsons with a more intricate plot. And yet people are stumbling over each other commending the complexity of this brainless blockbuster action cliché.

This scene was totally forgettable compared to the epic action scene between Morpheous and Neo (""Stop trying to hit me and hit me"")Also - there is hardly any build up - it goes from 2 layers of dreams to 6, whats the build up? more layers of dreams?

It's not all that.My biggest problem was that they couldn't get me to care about the relationship between Leonardo DiCaprio, his wife and his child, which was suppose to be Dom Cobb(DiCaprio character) biggest motivation. I could care less for any of the characters, I wasn't emotionally invested at all.This isn't the first time Christopher Nolan tried to take Film Art concepts and commercialize it. This is an attempt at making a surrealism commercial. The problem with trying to make a surreal movie for the general public is that you have to make it understandable to the masses. The dreams in the movie was too orderly. Surrealist films like, Un Chien Andalou, are chaotic like dreams.Big visuals and action sequences aren't enough anymore, if you can't get me care about what drives the story, you're going to lose me.","

Despite an abundance of arresting visuals and and some good performances (especially by Madeline Cotillard), which save it from a really low rating, it is a bad movie in many ways. It is unbearably talky, overcomplicated, pretentious and boring. The last hour cycles the same four scenes over and over, and the only sign the movie is moving toward resolution is that the van the dreaming characters are riding in falls five feet closer to the river at each cycle. By then I was drifting in and out of consciousness like the characters. The film score pounds at you with incessant Teutonic heaviness. The main character is so thinly characterized that you have little reason to root for him. I like Leo much better when he plays a character in reality and stays out of dreams.","

"Ryan_V","25 July 2010","Terrible film. There are way better iterations of dream films than this. Mulholland Dr. by David Lynch is one of them.Like some others have posted around the web, it was too long, and too confusing. Not that there was any depth or cleverness to the film. Too much repetition. They kept 'trying' to explain everything over and over again. It was just a stream of Hollywood trash. Didn't really seem like any of the subjects were dreaming at all. Just explosions and dumb dialogue, with shallow characters and a convoluted storyline.SPOILER ALERT...The film is a film about a man, Leonardo... an Architect, who falls asleep on a plane in first class. It's a long flight to LA, so the movie shows what he is dreaming about during that time that he is asleep on that flight. The only real part of the film is when he wakes up at the end in the plane. He looks around, sees a cabin full of people in first class, then gets off the plane, and goes home with Michael Caine, either his father, grandfather, or caretaker for his two children.The people in first class were in his dream because he saw them in the cabin before he fell asleep. They then each took on a part in his dreaming, but none of them have any connection to his real life. And no, he is not a thief. He is not hired by some black corporation to extract information from people through dreaming. There is nothing of the sort. The movie is just a dream.Supporting evidence:1. First, the movie is just shallow trash. Horrible illustration of a dream film just down to its core. It's so bad that it is obvious how hard they tried to make it look like a dream.2. Reference to Architects... a dream architect is simply what Leonardo is in real life: an Architect.3. Projection... they must have said projection 100 times. It's obvious that the movie is telling you that Leonardo is just projecting his own subconscious onto the others in his dream. This is the only part of the movie that is decent academically. The fact that the filmmakers understand what psychological projection is. But also, the fact that they repeated the concept of projection so many times it just lost its value. Anyway, Leonardo projects his wants, fears, and desires, in a convoluted way, onto the other subjects. For example, ""Fischer"" takes on his own self in relation to his father. Also, the girl who keeps telling him to move on is another projection of his own mind telling himself to move on from his wife's death...The movie progresses and gets ever more deeper into Leonardo's subconscious, where the root of his anxiety resides. He finally discovers that it is OK for him to be his own man, to be an Architect, and not try to live up to what his father was. So we have a set of problem(s) that reveal themselves ever so slightly as the dream progresses, in the form of Leonardo projecting his fears, etc. onto other subjects, until he goes so deep as to arrive at a place where he has a feeling it is really about him. Like a sort of solution. But like anything, the problems need to be apparent before a solution can be revealed. Dreaming is like this. Your mind weaves together a series of experiences, and projections, and if you understand them enough, you'll know what the problems really are, and you can then begin working on a solution in real life...He then wakes up. Reality is there. It was a cathartic release.4. The dream sharing... there is no literal dream sharing, getting into the minds of others and extracting their thoughts. This is a metaphor... the movie is telling us that there are a group of people in a small area (cabin of a plane) who are all dreaming... and they may have a bit of a spiritual connection to each other... so one person feeling anxious, another may 'feel' this while dreaming and some sort of shared experience results. It's a bit of a play on the idea that people can dream together and sort of experience similar or even the same things. But that's pseudo-science and mostly fiction.5. Recurring nightmare about his wife. Obviously this is another clear marker that it is just a dream. His recurring nightmare about his wife. Looks like she killed herself, perhaps jumped out of a hotel room window because Leonardo didn't show up for their anniversary. Perhaps he was not a good husband and wasn't around enough... he then blamed himself. The girl in the film kept telling him to move on... So Leonardo's major life issues were revealed in a convoluted way within a long dream. Like any human being, those issues are complex. The ending showed how he seemed relieved when he got home to see his kids. It looks like it was a very important dream because it pushed him over a threshold and helped him to realize a set of things to make his life better.Also, can we please stop with all the discussion about the tenability of the things seen in the film? Most of it won't make much sense: it was just a dream. Therefore, defying gravity, ending up in different stages of life so quickly, etc.... it all makes sense when understood from the perspective that: it. was. just. a. dream. Now, after such a lengthy review and explanation, you might be wondering why I only gave it 1 star. I'll end how I started: it's Hollywood trash. Too basic. Too stupid. Too obvious. And to someone how dreams every night, and the fact that there are way better films about dreaming out there, there is nothing to see here...","

It is always a risk to watch something that has been hyped up to be an intellectual masterpiece....because generally nothing will live up to your expectations.As others have stated, the ending was predictable, and several plot and dialogue elements seemed too contrived and banal. But for all that, it was a creative and entertaining thriller.Personally, I thought Blade Runner was more thought provoking and Memento more innovative.Maybe the problem is that I have seen so many of the movies from which this film seems to draw inspiration that Inception did not strike me as terribly original or thought provoking.Anyway, it was entertaining. Definitely worth a watch.","

It just makes soo much fun watching these Characters do their thing...On top of that the movie has such a great soundtrack. Hans Zimmer has once again topped himself.

"parolina","27 July 2010","Philosophically it was absurd. Here were the main points I gathered from it: Faith and doubt are discussed, but the conclusion is that having faith doesn't matter because you can't know what's real anyways. What did the Japanese businessman's non-faith avail him or di Caprio's character's faith avail him? They both ended up having the same destiny, no? So, freewill is an illusion, too. Skepticism is the only valid approach to life. Existentialism is true; we really do make life to be whatever we want it to be. Top remains spinning at end, or does it eventually topple? Was it dream or reality? Who knows? Does it matter? No, existentialism says we can define our own reality to our liking. Relativism of truth: i.e., truth is whatever you make it up to be. Subjectivism / idealism / Cartesianism / Kantianism, i.e., ideas are all that are real. If the senses are to be 100% distrusted for determining what is real, we might all be as insane (possessed) as the Dark Knight's Joker. Objective reality, for all practical purposes, does not exist. Every subject just makes up his or her own reality. This leads to solipsism and ultimately a suicidal nihilism. Murder can be justified as long as the person you are killing is someone's ""projection."" Di Caprio's character snipes men in the snow scene to the architect girl's surprise; he justifies this by saying they are just another man's ""projection."" Magic potions (i.e., potent drugs) are the solution to anyone's problems.Christopher Nolan should brush-up on some real, Aristotelean-Thomistic philosophy, but then maybe the movie would not have fooled the audience into thinking it is profound instead of absurd. There were good parts—the importance of fatherhood and family, for example—but they were overshadowed by ambiguity for the sake of ambiguity.Also, artistically, it could've done without most of the car-chase and shooting scenes and confronted more head-on the philosophical issue it was raising, i.e., ""What is real? What is being, existence? Etc,"" rather than hiding its ignorance in a silly plot scheme involving ""kicks,"" ""inception,"" and other Freudian, postmodern rubbish. If it were 1 hour shorter, it would have still been the same: absurdity at its best.","

"Theo Robertson","4 April 2015","Somewhat belatedly I reviewed INCEPTION . The reason for the delay is because I think Nolan is the most overrated director working today . I'm not saying he's a bad director just an overrated one whose films seem to rocket high up in to the IMBDb top 250 list . He is a good ideas man but like Michael Crichton for over 20 years the premise of his films aren't fully developed and his ideas often owe more to other people . The idea of a film taking place in reverse is as old as cinema itself believe it or not . INTERSTELLAR owes much to 2001 and an apocalyptic novel by John Christopher written in 1956 and with INCEPTION .... oh dear INCEPTION On a visual level INCEPTION is very impressive . We've all seen those nifty trailers with characters standing around in the middle of collapsing landscapes . This isn't really indicative of how the film plays out . Instead we have pretty boy character A meeting character B Character A : "" You know how when you have a dream blah blah blah ?"" Character B: ""Yes"" Character A: ""Blah blah blah"" and by the time pretty boy has explained the plot mechanics and exposition to character XYZ I felt like someone should be waking me up . Not only that but some of us are old enough to remember other - and dare I state better ? - virtual reality movies . At the end of the day INCEPTION reminds me of one of Steven Moffat's timey wimey twist turney tales from DOCTOR WHO that is trying to be too clever and at the same time ends up becoming a mess and the reaction of ""Oh my gosh what a very clever original idea"" from IMDb commentators leaves me perplexed","

Some people have even suggested this is one of the top 5 films of all time. Bizarre.What Inception really reminded me of was the Emporer's New Clothes. If enough people say something is great a lot of others are likely to be swept along by the idea, frightened to go against popular opinion. Well I'm glad that a lot of people have been honest enough to say that this film is not half as good as the marketing department would have us believe.The latest I heard from the pluggers was the film has to be seen more than once to appreciate it. Ha! Good try guys but I can't imagine anyone being prepared to give this another try.The script made no sense and the characters were unbelievable. Worst of all, I felt no attachment for any of the characters and did not care what happened to them.In my opinion, this is a meaningless, uninspired waste of time. Unoriginal idea, weak script, insipid acting, plot and logic holes galore do not add up to a blockbuster. The film gets 4 marks for the impressive CGI but loses 2 of those for the derivative James Bond sequence.The lady to my left spent the last two hours sound asleep. I was very jealous of her.","

"mnoraznan","31 October 2010","UNDERWHELMING, LITERAL AND PRETENTIOUS.. These 3 words pretty much summed up the whole of Inception. Why populate the dream world with the same landscape and tone as the real world? Why the dreamers and their subconscious armed with real-world accessories and firearms? Why must the travel initiated with the actor's pretend sleep? Why does the levels are differentiated with only different decor? (Except the LIMBO realm) WHERE IS THE IMAGINATION? Nolan has the perfect opportunity to execute his wildest imaginations and he messed it up and served us mediocrity. Apparently, he only has the most literal interpretation of dreams. No quirky visual manifestation (mirror-world? top-down switched?), no mystical representation of the subconscious (shadows, shades, animals etc), No difference between dream levels (tones-darker?grayer?more grotesque?), No symbolic representative of weapons ( energy? aura's? light? dark? ). AND OF COURSE, the travel method!NOLAN could've presented a more sophisticated facade. Maybe a dream room with vivid machines powered with mysterious matter. Or for mobility, more visible contraptions for head, neck or body. Then, the transition can be cued with portals, or one's self entering the target's body or....to be more fantastical; the reality bleeds or tears itself into an underworld which is the dream.INSTEAD, what we've got is inferior chase and action set pieces. Save for the gimmicks of collapsing the landscape onto itself, making pathways, the movie's rather bland. It also features too many characters - the forgers, architects, point man, sedative-man, corporate-sponsor man.......you get it. IT SHOULD be anchored by one solid protagonist that's let say have a latent talent for some form of ability (dream-walker but is named with Latin words), his target and the source of his internal conflicts (family, lover, friend).This movie fools layman into thinking that they're smart.IT is basically an inferior imitation of Michael Bay's summer blockbuster disguised as a thinking man's movie. IT'S ABOUT CORPORATE ESPIONAGE - Tell people that and it would be 100% true. CERTAINLY NOT travel between dream worlds....","

This sums up the production of this nonsense spectacular special effects production, onward with baloney gibberish dialogs! It's ending is as pathetic as anyone could hope for! I felt disappointed with this movie, despite of the enormous efforts that were put into it by this production's Special Effects Unit who had copied and duplicated their special effects from ""Men in Black"" and from ""The Matrix."" All in all, this Sci-Fi story is an over publicized ESPIONAGE NONSENSE! I MEAN AN UTTER AND TOTAL NONSENSE!!","

"alexx668","23 January 2011","""What's the most resilient parasite? An idea. A single idea from the human mind can build cities. An idea can transform the world and rewrite all the rules. Which is why I have to steal it."" That is the motto of ""Inception"". It is a very intriguing idea in itself, but one which the film only goes superficially to explore. To cover for this superficiality, the plot is given a superficially complex guise, but actually it's pretty straightforward.Leonardo DiCaprio and his team invade people's dreams to steal information from their subconscious. However, their new mission in ""Inception"" is not to steal information, bur rather to ""plant"" it, therefore causing the inception of a new idea in the target's subconscious. To do this, they form dreams within dreams (which in the film actually work as three separate dreams rather than actual dreams within dreams), therefore accessing a more vulnerable form of the target's subconscious.For some reason (which the film doesn't adequately explain) within the dream there is a symbol of the subconscious motive (say, a safe) whereas you can find the desired information, or whereas you can plant the desired information. But there's a catch. If for some reason you ""die"" in a dream within a dream, you remain in subconscious limbo (which again is not adequately explained) which nevertheless can resemble a form of reality in itself.Amidst all that, Christopher Nolan makes an action film, with car chases, gunshots etc etc.Here is the thing with Nolan. As a director he only offers intrigue. He approaches an ambitious idea, touches the surface of it, but then hesitates to proceed any further, and reverts to the action film prototype. Furthermore, he has done it so many times already, that even the action segments look pompous and clichéd (too much reliance on editing and warping of real time).This is a confused film, which tries to hide it's inadequacies in a needlessly confusing plot.Once again with a Nolan film, ambiguity prevails. When DiCaprio and his wife are stuck in subconscious limbo, the wife ""locks"" the idea of doubting an objective reality, and throws away the key. DiCaprio invades her subconscious and replants the idea, thus when they re-enter real life the idea remains. But the idea was there in the first place, wasn't it? The sub-plot with Robert Fischer is stated in such a way so that it impresses with it's artificial ""complexity"" (in the first ""layer"" of dream, DiCaprio's team plant seeds of doubt; in the second layer of dream they direct Fischer into facing this doubt; and in the third layer of dream he faces it, duh), but it is suggested that the seeds of Fischer's discomfort were already rooted in real life, with DiCaprio's team merely fast-forwarding them (hence ambiguity again). The icing on the cake is we never learn whether DiCaprio has returned to real life or not (ambiguity).What a mess. The only thing this multiple dream architecture serves is that it spices up what is essentially a simple plot: that somebody enters someone's dream in order to plant an idea. That's all there is to it.As it is, ambiguity characterizes Christopher Nolan very nicely, as he seems eternally torn between the commercial action film and.. something else (without that ""something else"" ever taking shape). Nolan must stop hinting at a grander scope and actually embrace it.","

"dick-sanders","2 August 2010","This is a tedious and boring movie that begs you to NOT suspend your disbelief and, instead, to wad up your popcorn bag and throw it at the screen. Okay, I exaggerate a little. But... Read the insightful reviews dated 19 July: You Don't Get It. And 20 July: Boring, Too Long, Awful Dialogue. And 21 July: Not Bad But Definitely Not Genius. And 29 July: Dumb, Dumb, Dumb. And finally, for a little fun, 23 July: Blah. Rather than rehash the insights of those helpful reviews, I'll try to add something useful...Inside of 30 minutes I was squirming in my seat, tapping my fingers, and checking my watch. Why? No character development. No sense that a good story had been started. And thus no engagement. As time wore on I found I really didn't care about any of the characters, or their plights, or what they were trying to accomplish, other than thinking Ellen Page was kind of cute.In an EW interview, Nolan says about his film, Memento, that he was ""trying to transcend the tyranny of linear narrative."" Really? A tyranny? We live in a linear narrative, Chris, but now that I know you feel that way about life, I'll remember not to pay to see your films. In the same interview, Nolan says that he was worried that his audience wouldn't be able to follow his brain-bending movie because of the complex dream-within-a-dream plot... until he lit upon (drum roll) the ""heist-flick model,"" in which the hero-thieves explain their scheme. Yes, Chris, but that's not a very good model. And what's more, it only works if the ""explaining is minimal"" and the director is skilled enough to show and reveal more. It's a moving picture, remember? Yes, the action here is pretty cool, better than the Dark Knight. The camera and stunt work are very good. The music is the same gloomy heavy-handed kind used in Dark Knight (same composer, Hans Zimmer). But the characters are essentially two-dimensional because everything is secondary to the plot, which in spite of its complexity you can understand well enough because it's all explained to you, endlessly. Even Dicaprio wasn't happy with his character and worked with Nolan for two months ""adding layers"" for more emotional depth (see the Rolling Stone interview). But apparently the complexity and ridiculousness of the plot buried that, or Nolan just didn't know how to deliver it (come to think of it, this may be a problem with all of his films). Plot over character. Cool factor over emotion. You think of the great work DiCaprio did in The Aviator. And the brilliant work by Gordon-Levitt in The 500 Days of Summer. I wasn't much of a fan of Juno, but Ellen Page ""made"" that movie. And of course Michael Caine has made many great movies, including the recent Harry Brown. Also, Ken Watanabe in The Last Samurai. And finally, let's not forget Marion Cotillard's stunning Oscar-winning performance in La Vie En Rose. But they're all struggling mightily here with Nolan's tedious script, and their immense talent is wasted.But of course, I'm all wrong. The movie is a huge hit. It's sure to rack up $500 million or more in worldwide box office sales. Whew! That's good news. Because then Nolan can go on ""transcending the tyranny.""","

"CaseyFlynn","25 July 2010","I am astonished by the reviews posted. My only explanation is that this deadly dull movie put everyone else to sleep and they thought they saw a better movie. The performances were very lackluster and the actors all (except for Tom Hardy) looked like they were performing in their sleep.There was no reason for any of the characters to be involved in this plan from a personal motivation reason, and their behaviours were completely arbitrary. Did they get paid for their time or was there some other reason to what they were doing in this scheme with the main character? I felt no connection or empathy for the main character or his motivation. There was no sense of unreality or mystery one would expect in a dream. The action sequences were dull and seemed to be just shooting people because there was a perceived need to have some gun fire. I struggled to stay in the theatre and see it through let alone stay awake.","

"zadok-332-444684","9 January 2014","This is a nice action-flick. Entertaining and well made. Now it is supposed to be about dreams. This should be a treat for all those of us who treasure Kafka or H.P. Lovecraft, right? Ever had a lucid dream? Now this will be awesome! ... Or perhaps not. What is presented here is no more a dream than James Bond so to speak. It's not actually surreal. The whole ""diving into a dream"" thing comes down to a couple of ""rules"" to follow plus some FX. The FX are well done actually. That alone would probably alleviate this film beyond the likes of ""The Day after Tomorrow"" or ""2012"" - it's everything else that ruins it. In any case Dream is just fantasy here. Any film delivers that much. It's just cheesy to have this scenario ""in a persons dream"". Ultimately the whole dream thing is just a facade to have the plot jump from here to there without actually creating a meaningful connection. At least this concept allows the film to have everything at once and offer even more than zapping through the best channels on prime time.","

"PWNYCNY","16 July 2010","The problem with this movie is that the plot is too convoluted, thus diverting attention away from the movie's basic premise, that of how the brain functions during sleep. This is a fascinating, esoteric subject but like all fascinating subjects, when Hollywood gets a hold of it, look out! You may be in for a ride, to a place we know not where. A story works best when it has a beginning, a middle and and end. When you tamper with that structure, such as by starting a movie with a flashback, you're inviting confusion and frankly, who wants to go to the movies to be confused. Stories should be told straightforwardly, but that is not the case with this movie. Is Mr. DiCaprio in a dream or not? After a while, it becomes a moot point as the movie just keeps rambling on and on to its inevitable conclusion. Nevertheless, the movie does explore some interesting subjects such as idea formation, mind manipulation, the subconscious and mental activity during sleep. Where the movie stalls is in plausibility and structure. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the movie is worth watching because of Leonardo DiCaprio who once again gives an excellent performance as a stalwart yet troubled mind prober. He carries the movie which alone makes it watchable. Once again Hollywood has taken a perfectly good idea for a movie and has watered it down. Brainwashing is a fascinating subject. It is a key element in The Manchurian Candidate. How do we know that our ideas are actually ours and not planted into our heads? That is the underlying theme of this movie. The problem is, the story itself is so muddled and confusing that at times it becomes a distraction. Leonardi DiCaprio is excellent as a mind prober with emotional issues which get in the way of doing his job. The premise of the story is interesting , especially as it relates to questions of consciousness and unconsciousness and the formulation of ideas during sleep. But then the movie loses focus as the DiCaprio character gets more and more hung up on his emotional problems, thus diverting attention away from the movie's original premise. However, this is a good movie and is worth watching but with this disclaimer: it may put you to sleep.","

"rjw930","21 July 2010","Inception is one of those movies that ""engaged"" film-goers will mistake for genius. Let me explain my theory on people and movies. There are three types of movie-watchers: passive, engaged, and intelligently engaged. Passive people will watch Die Another Day and like it just as much as the Bourne Identity. They don't go to the movies to think, they go to be entertained by cool effects and witty one-liners. Engaged people think they know what they're talking about, and generally love movies that are edgy in plot and execution but conventional enough to understand, like Fight Club and the subject of this review. They believe themselves to be refined in cinema, but, in reality, just don't quite have the intellect, cinematically speaking, to pull it off. Intelligently engaged people will appreciate the complexity of Inception, but also recognize it's a little sloppy, self-serious, over drawn, and empty. They recognize its audacity, but don't pretend like it is Kubrick or Paul Thomas Anderson. Suffice it to say, most people who fall into the engaged category will try and pretend that Inception is a 'masterpiece' and that they know everything about movies. They don't. Inception is clever, but it doesn't rank anything above respectable.The premise is ingenious, and Inception is able to live off its sheer mind-bendiness for the first 45 minutes. Leo is a specialist at entering people's minds through their dreams and extracting, or in this case, planting information. The dream world Nolan creates is so exciting and unpredictable that the audience, me included, couldn't care less about the actual story line. Unfortunately, when the magic wears off and the extravagantly overlong climax starts (almost at the midway point), things fall apart.The first problem is the eventual goal of the whole operation is seriously anti-climactic. As far as I could tell, they're trying to break up some obscure monopolistic multi-national company for a rich CEO, who in turn will give them large sums of money and Leo a way back to his kids. Sound under-developed? It is. Nolan never really fleshes it out. He is too busy creating spectacularly slick effects to get caught up in silly things like crucial plot points.When Inception hits its final profligate culmination (the climax inside the climax), I couldn't help but notice how empty it all was. Nolan makes the mistake of thinking multiple things happening at once equals suspense. In an effort to ratchet up the intensity, Nolan piles on at least 5 simultaneous plot-lines that climax at the same time. All this serves to do is suffocate the little suspense that had been built up. There is literally a fifteen minute stretch where Hans Zimmer's deafening score blares and Nolan annoyingly flips through the parallel actions like an ADD-afflicted friend who can't decide what channel to watch. It's mind- numbing, not to mention confusing as hell. One of these little subplots is particularly ridiculous and consists of a guy running around a snowbound bunker shooting people for the whole 15 minutes. Cutting-edge techno thriller? At this point, I was thinking more along the lines of a Roger Moore Bond flick.For all its structural faults, the single most damning aspect of Inception is its complete lack of heart or emotion. The one remotely human thread in the film deals with Leo and his mysterious dead wife. This thread is drawn out to excess and becomes more and more incomprehensible as the movie progresses. Inception seems to delight in keeping the audience in the dark regarding if Leo's wife is real or just a projection of his subconscious. Inception thinks it's awfully clever, but it's hard to feel emotion towards characters that you're not even sure exist. Near the end, I found the dialog between the unhappy couple completely devoid of meaning, made worse by Nolan attempting to give it resonance through close ups of people crying and a climaxing score. Despite the fact that the majority of this review deals with Inception's shortcomings, I actually like the movie as a whole. For all of its faults, I was grudgingly won over through Inception's pure style and visceral power. Nolan occasionally strikes brilliance, especially in an early scene where a dream explodes around Ellen and Leo in slow-motion virtuosity. This movie is not the genius many will claim, but it's not so bad either. Give it a shot, just don't expect to dream about it afterwards.","

Nolan's direction is masterful in keeping the audience engaged throughout the film's 2-hour-28-minute runtime. The special effects are also noteworthy, with the dreamscapes being brought to life in stunning detail.However, Inception is not without its flaws.

I just add this in order to contradict the hype that has allowed this movie to be ranked so high in IMDb. The same has been happening with other movies, and that is a shame for IMDb, which is becoming unreliable.I want to stress the fact that the only complexity in this movie is trying to figure out how you can invest so much money in a script that continuously makes a fool of the average critic intelligent viewer! The story is not complex. It is deliberately confusing in order to conceal its stupidity. Nothing that really matters is explained in the movie.And there's so many embarrassing clichés (the recruiting of the team, the episode in Mombassa, the assault of the ice fortress, many of the action sequences)... the average viewer must be disappointed!And the dreams - which serve as the scenario to most of the movie - are populated by the utmost lack of imagination.Finally, there's the score, louder and louder, building a suspense that is never there, for everything is a dream, and we do not quite catch what there is exactly that can go wrong...Well, all in all, the movie is an insult to the average intelligent viewer and, having been directed by Christopher Nolan, an ultimate disappointment.","

"eatpajdittsvin","31 January 2011","Inception is an interesting movie without a doubt (refer to one of the countless other reviews for why that is). What I am going to focus on is why I think it's not a 9/10 which is what the IMDb voters on average have given it. I will also make the presumption you have seen the movie, as it's not productive to repeat the plot. The second reason is because a fair amount of time has gone since I saw the movie (twice), and although that means I've had lots of time to think it through, I don't remember all the details.First, let me state the most immediate reason to why I didn't like the movie that much: The second half of the movie is a long string of bog standard action sequences. Yes, it's trying to be tense, but it doesn't manage to surprise me one bit - the ending is nearly completely predictable. Throughout, I care about only a few of the characters, and about none of the endless imaginary minions they are facing. If this fairly large flaw had been absent, the movie would at least have been a 9/10 for me.Now for the more subtle problems: I feel that not enough was done to emphasize that the mission takes place in a dream world. Most of the time, the movie's ""dream"" world is indistinguishable to the real world. This similarity is intended (it is argued that the dreamer otherwise would become suspicious and wake up, or reject inception). Unfortunately, it means there are few chances to surprise us... That's where we return to ""bog standard action sequences"": Sure there are a few cool twists that illustrate the characters are in a dream, like the city being turned upside down; but these devices are for the most part absent once the inception mission starts, and thus have minor impact in total.Obviously, this movie defies all physical laws, which would be okay if there is an alternative set of rules to cover for reality. It doesn't have such a coherent rule set however; instead, it is mostly reminiscent of movies where anything convenient is made up for whatever is supposed to be happening on screen. The bad guys perform wildly differently depending on whether the protagonists are supposed to be able to escape or not, rules for various dream levels diverge too much, and so on. In short, the script fails to lend itself credibility - one cannot simply say ""it's a dream, we don't have to care about plausibility"".Aside from more than a few inconsistencies and 'too implausible to be believable'-facts, is is noticeable the background story/universe is mostly invented from scratch for this film. Perhaps it would have benefited Inception if a clearer connection to some existing religious or other fantasy theme had been made. We can only speculate for now, but I do hope someone decides to make another movie with the ""entering dreams of others"" theme with stronger ties to some existing mythology.All in all, these complaints are pretty minor (except for the aforementioned way Inception attempts too much to be an action/thriller movie towards the latter parts). I'm giving it 7/10, since it made me stare at my watch several times to determine when I would no longer have to endure more clinical action sequences without substance.","

Could this be Nolan's own subconscious, commenting on his own limitations as a writer and director?Cobb undertakes to plant an idea in someone's head so that Cobb's employer can monopolize an industry. Cobb succeeds, and thereby recovers his own life. No one in the film questions the morality of this; the film doesn't really question the morality of this, or invite the viewer to do so. Apparently, it's just business. Although in a way that is often thin, banal, or hypocritical, usually the sentiments offered to us in movies managed to stay aligned with basic ideas of good and evil.

"Zyxyzmusic","26 January 2011","As long as it remains possible to spend 100 million dollars on making drivel, setting aside 10 million towards advertising in order to tell people that it's great so that they've spent 200 million on tickets before they find out otherwise, there'll be no incentive for Hollywood movie-making ever to improve.I've reviewed Angelina Jolie's latest farrago in very similar terms. While that movie bizarrely assumes that the Cold War still remains of interest to anyone (?), ""Inception"" insists basically that it's interesting to watch other people's dreams. Well, visually it can be - the ""architecture-bending"" style of ""Inception"" would have had great appeal, maybe in a 60-second advert for a credit card or mobile phone company.But visual appeal aside, the ""plot"" of the movie is not so much multi-layered as multi- pointless. The old cliché that ""if you die in dream you wake up"" is hauled out here with monotonous regularity, but it's never applied consistently, and even if it were, who cares? If you MUST fire a machine gun at someone in a dream (and I can't think of any reason why you'd really need to), why would you ever run out of bullets? Wouldn't you just dream up some more? If you want to blow up a dream hotel, do you really NEED dream explosives? If the fuse goes out, is it safe to return, or should you always light the dreamy blue touchpaper and stand well back? The movie's makers assume that multi-layering these various dream levels will be endlessly fascinating (as evidenced by the enormous running time), but anyone with an ounce of discernment will simply become less and less connected as the plot becomes ""deeper"". We're in the same childish, ill-conceived territory here as many movies about existing in ""virtual reality"" or even ""on the holodeck"". Simulate as convincingly as you like, but you can't change the laws of physics in the real world, and if you're in a dream, then there's no real need to worry about being stabbed or shot, and neither should the viewer care whether the characters are, or aren't.The urban myth being put about that ""Inception"" includes some sort of interesting or unexpected ending is no more than that.For a witty, snappy meditation on alternative reality, try Cronenberg's ""eXistenZ"", and (despite the fact that, like, when you're dreaming you know, your life goes really slowly and, like, you can live a whole lifetime in the dreamy dream state, man) try to give this bloated waste of time a miss.","

It is your typical Hollywood flick with car chases, shooting galore, explosions, fistfights, pretty boys and girls - the whole nine yards to sell tickets to the ADHD generation of teenagers. I gave it 3 stars - instead of just 2 - because the special effects are absolutely astonishing. This film wishes to be clever but really is not and does not make a lot of sense either.

"mreesesh","4 December 2010","Christopher Nolan has done some great work.His ideas and direction singlehandedly gave new life to the beloved superhero Batman.While the film Dark Knight will always be recognized to the new dimensions it added to the classic Batman series of movies and comics, Inception was nothing more than a dull and linear plot, surrounded by and an even duller and more linear plot.The centerpiece of this movie was supposed to be its convoluted storyline which was scattered across multiple levels, in essence puzzle that forces the viewer to think through the movie and decipher the ending.The concept of ""levels"" and or ""interconnected plots"" worked very well for such great films such as the Matrix, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Logan's Run, or Total Recall. Inception not only miserably fails at this but it also lacks in other places as well.-Characters: Great actors, whom have all done great work in many movies spanning decades. However the characters in this movie came off as neutered eunuchs who lacked sense, emotion, and any sort of cohesiveness. (Sir Michael Caine and Tom Berenger's performances were appalling and the ""team"" of dreamers lacked screen dynamics and chemistry.) -Action: For a dream world, the action in this movie is very unimaginative and is well within the typical Hollywood bounds. Car cash scenes where the heroes drive and shoot, building shootouts, and melodramatic bullet wounds (as always one character is wounded critically, the team must save him; however the character can still ""fight"".) -Plot: This movie could have easily been over within 1 hour of rolling. Not only was Inception's ""puzzle ending"" blatantly obvious 40 mins into the film, but the storyline it self lacked any substance or draw. The overly complicated ""puzzle piece"" effect which Nolan was trying to achieve, was nothing more than the main story line being surrounded by excessive fluff and whimsical bullplop.*I will credit the movie with one notable mention. Nolan managed to work a Matrix style fight scene (which have been overdone by Hollywood since the early 2000s) into the small confines of an elevator.In the ending, Inception is not the great rave that many make it out to be. While the movie takes place in a ""dream world"", where bounds are limitless, the movie itself is sterile, cliché, repetitive, and unimaginative. This is even further compounded by one dimensional characters, and a drawn out storyline that pretends to be an enigma.Perhaps Christopher Nolan's true intent was to make a sterile and lack luster movie aimed strictly at making today's self-absorbed and obtuse Facebook-hipster generation feel ""smart"".Inception can be compared to a class presentation where the student is unprepared. To hide this, the student uses convoluted and circular logic to stammer through the presentation and pass the time. It is obvious that the student knows nothing and has wasted several minutes talking about a subject that could have been explained in seconds.

"Zando777","7 October 2010","I didn't expect too much from this, given Leonardo DiCaprio's presence, but was surprised how weak and unwatchable it ultimately was. This film was nothing but special effects -- it was impossible to care about any of the characters, and there was nothing truly interesting or thoughtful about it. No twists, no surprises, nothing. I was one of the few times I really felt like I'd wasted 2 hours of my life, and got nothing out of it.Nolan's earlier ""Memento"" was far more original, thoughtful, and fascinating, both throughout, and in the ultimate plot reveals. The 13th Floor is a far better execution of a similar theme, more straightforward and interesting.Save your money, and don't waste your time or money on this vastly overrated collection of silly, pointless special effects to no apparent purpose.","

It delivers some good and sometimes unbelievable (not always in a good sense) action, it has some interesting twists and performances are convincing enough, but that's about it. On the bad side, the film it's a bit too long, the characters aren't well developed and the end isn't very satisfactory.This film is a mix between Matrix (slow motion, different reality), Memento (present/past vs dreamworld/ real world and flashbacks) and James Bond (action).So, an entertaining movie with some interesting details but a somehow disappointing end.","

This is particularly true for this pretentious piece of c$%p. To echo that of previous reviewers, weak plot, overly confusing attempt at creating another 'dream movie'. I attempted to watch this film 4 times, refusing to accept that I couldn't 'get it'. The fourth attempt lasted slightly longer as I wanted to give it more attention. However, boredom soon set in and I found myself reaching for the remote control once more.It really amazes me that people can enjoy watching such pap.

"joehemmings68","12 January 2015","As a Christopher Nolan film that didn't have Batman in it, I was expecting big things. Nolan is a director who can come up with really cool concepts, and use them to make really cool films. Thanks to his Batman success he had been entrusted with a much larger budget to put behind one of his ideas. You can see where the money has gone. His interesting ideas are perfectly visualised on screen, there are a lot of really cool visual moments.The issue with Inception is the idea itself. The film is not half as clever as it thinks it is, and there are a lot of little niggles and plot holes that have to be glossed over in order for the film to hold together at all. Only two characters get any real development at all, the rest are there only for the various reasons that the plot needs them there for. Hardy is enjoyable, and Levitt has a few good moments, but in general these side characters aren't engaging at all.I must say, I loved the ending, and found it quite challenging. It was really the only time the film actually made me properly think in an interested way rather than an annoyed or confused way.Compare this to other blockbusters, it has to be commended for at least an attempt at an interesting concept and trying to make you think. I don't think it's particularly successful at either. Compare this to Memento, and it's clear Memento is the better film, with a more interesting plot and more rousing feel.","

"imagiking","21 July 2010","Reaping money like there's no tomorrow and rocketing to the top of IMDb to contend with even The Godfather and Shawshank, Inception has had nothing but success since its release. An incredible sceptic toward all things popular, especially in their earliest days, I fully expected this to be quite poor and overrated.Working as an independent dream-thief, Dom Cobb is tasked with the more difficult job of implanting a thought within the mind of a subject, the promise of reunion with the family from which he is estranged his motivation to do so. Forging a team of assorted talents, he plans an intricate network of dreams and deceit whilst simultaneously coping with increasingly realistic memories of the past.When a film garners almost universal acclaim and high rankings all around, discussion turns quickly away from the work itself, and more towards its accolades. Such is certainly the case with Inception, its current spot at number 3 on the top 250 as much the subject of discussion boards as the (soi-disant) intricacies of its plot. Like its predecessor in Nolan's filmography, The Dark Knight, Inception is now praised variously as genius, brilliant, revolutionary, and ""the greatest film ever"". Yet almost for every fanboy who screams the wonders of this sci-fi epic is a cynic, tutting with disapproval and angrily muttering about the decline of modern civilisation. What we're currently seeing is a replay of Nolan's fortunes just two years ago. Some call him the new Kubrick, others dismiss him as a glorified Michael Bay. The arguments between these two camps have been the subject of more discussion than the film's merits, or lack thereof; indeed such is the content of this ""review"" so far. My point: people feel compelled by such acclaim to either love the film, or to hate it, leaving a disturbing imbalance in its ratings. Unless you take a stand and proclaim it ludicrous garbage, anything other than unending praise will see you labelled a thoughtless moron, incapable of artistic appreciation or sagacious thought. Those who rate it a 1 out of 10 are making a point, refusing to stand for overrating. The simple fact is that Inception is a good film: entertaining; interesting; superb looking; well-acted; well-directed. Is it a masterpiece? No, absolutely not. Its flaws are many, both logically and cinematically; its moments of brilliance few. Aside from excellent effects and anti-gravitational fight sequences, it holds insufficient emotional impact to transcend the general mediocrity of its genre: the heist thriller in essence. And that is it. The film is perfectly entertaining, but at no stage is it anything special. I enjoyed myself, but certainly see nothing within it to warrant such vigorous fanaticism. And the ending was silly, overused, and lazy.A key example of the way in which people forget what they really should be discussing, Inception has become naturally presumed as a deep and thoughtful movie, probing far into recondite things and leaving us to formulate our own theories and opinions. In truth it is a standard action film, delivering a solid chunk of appealing-to-the-eye entertainment (some of the best for a while), but little more. Its plot is complex rather than its meaning, a key mistake audiences will continue to make as they argue and bicker. I just wish people could sit back and enjoy the film, rather than messing their pants at every halfway decent movie that hits the screen.",NA

However , I will warn anyone from walking into the theater unaware of what the storyline is about . I saw Shutter Island and really enjoyed DiCaprio's performance despite some negative reviews it got from professional critics . ...... So I paid my $12 bucks and bought a ticket for Inception and walked in without knowing what to expect . I thought this film would be more of a psychological thriller but I was mistaken . I found myself trying to play catch-up with this confusing plot from start to finish . I remember seeing people floating around in zero gravity, machine guns blazing , bombs exploding , buildings collapsing , numerous car crashes , and lots and lots of chase scenes , fights, falls, and natural disasters . Just about everything you would expect to see in any big budget summer action flick . By the time this long movie ended I couldn't have cared less . As I exited the theater I looked at the faces of my fellow movie goers . No one commented on how good it was or how much it stunk . They just looked relieved this unnecessarily long nightmare was over and quietly left . Most people here who took the time to review this picture apparently were not disappointed as I was . So I guess I'm in the minority of unhappy of Inception reviewers . If I could re-edit this movie I would 1) Chop off one hour . 2) Remove all dialog . 3) Speed up the film . 4) Change the soundtrack to that of The Benny Hill Show . ......... The next time I feel in need of another nightmare adventure I think I'll take an Ambien and hop in my clothes dryer .. I gave this movie a 4 because of some really good special effects ...

"ermhm","23 July 2010","Why are people going mental over this Matrix/Paprika wannabe? It's undeservingly credited for way to many things. Maybe I'm being too harsh since it's the best blockbuster in the last two years, but lets be honest. The first half of the movie is drowning in clichés and the rule 'show, don't tell' is not being utilized at all. Am I the only one who finds those tedious dialogues when they explain the whole plot (as if we were ten year olds) - really annoying? The real people in those situations would talk and react completely differently. That makes the character interactions and conversations barely believable and just empty.Also, actors who play Saito and Mal are really destroying any credibility of the drama and tension movie has. Saito (besides being a Morpheus wannabe) always talks as if he was simply happy he remembered the lines. And why, oh why do they have such unnatural, bad and forced accents? Ellen Page was a bad choice too (another cliché - younger student learns everything sensei has to say in 2 min and then teaches HIM a lesson). DiCaprio wasted his talent here, his powerful acting was ruined by the forced tension of the movie and a lousy soundtrack (which apparently never stops).The second half of the movie was better and combined with the end gave a certain satisfaction in terms of mental food. Nolan really is a master of plot and king of moments - unfortunately this is obviously becoming his biggest weakness. The overall impression is: it could have been a LOT better. It's not awful, but giving it a 10 and calling it a benchmark is just ridiculous.",NA
"Tokyo-1997","13 October 2010","I have heard many good reviews about this movie but somehow this movie just did not work for me. I watched this movie two months ago in a nearby theatre with my sister. My sister found this movie to be a brilliant one but not me. The idea used in this movie is a good one, the storyline is decent and the special effects used are creative and well done. I like the dreamlike quality of this movie. The anti-gravitational scenes and one scene where stuff starts to explode all over the place was well made. This movie has got a lot of action taking place with some interesting violent scenes. The ending was a very well done and unique one. However, there are just to many things I did not like about this movie so it did not really work for me. This movie is far too complicating, possibly one of the most complicating movies I have ever seen. I have to watch the movie and try to fit in the pieces of jigsaw puzzle for this movie at the same time. I found it very difficult to understand what each character was doing, and what happened. One of the most difficult to understand scenes include the scenes around the first few minutes. The opening scene during the first few minutes was just confusing. I love the idea used in this film though and the spinning of the top was interesting. However this movie is just too confusing from the start to the end credits that it just did not work for me. Sorry. I still would recommend this movie due to its originality though. Score: 6/10",NA

"CelluloidDog","25 July 2010","I saw this movie with a big group of 10. I would guess the group's rating might be an 8.5, very enjoyable! Personally I was one of the 2-3 least gripped maybe because I've seen too many movies. The 9.3 rating on IMDb is enthusiasm in a bubble. And bubbles do burst. Those mesmerized will vote this film as fun as a roller coaster - pop entertainment but no masterpiece. That said, it is best to compare this as one of the latest rides in Universal Studios theme park rather than belonging in the halls of cinema's greatest films. For pure entertainment, Inception gets a 8.5 in an IMAX theatre so it really helped when they talked about a ""kick"" and your seat gets a kick. Nolan tends to give us kicks for thought. Comparatively Nolan's Memento is a bit creative and the ending of the Prestige bizarrely entertaining and horrifying. In general, Inception has more firepower than either The Prestige or Memento. Its special effects and editing are exquisitely done and captivates the audience. So it is entertainment on high adrenalin.As a film, however, Inception is at times awkward and confusing. Perhaps that sets up the audience for the dreams. The reality check was the 747 and the totems the characters used. The script is generic and simple but there are psychoanalytic allegories. One of the screenwriters must have been a chess player since the whole mind game evolves from that and references to Robert Fischer, the prey of the mind criminals, could be mistaken for the American grandmaster. The idea of him seizing his father's empire (the chessboard and the desire to kill one's father, as in the Oedipus complex) is psycho-babble. Inception takes this theme subtly with the implicit use of Ariadne Ellen Page's pawn totem. The characters are all pawns in chess dream. We always speculate on dream control and whether falling means death. Much of the dream states are unimaginative clichés, however, the layering of them makes it interesting. Leonardo's last movie, Shutter Island, was a better blur between reality and fantasy. We see Inception as an intellectual challenge, but it is more a technical challenge which leaves the characters and the real story undeveloped. What is the real underlying story? I think it is Dorn Cobb's desire to reunite with his dead wife and with his children. In fact, given the brass top totem is not Dorn's (Leonardo's), but belongs to his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), one wonders at the end whether it is a dream or not. The mind crime was a dream and the reality was an ordinary man traveling to visit his family after his wife dies. Note at the end, none of the characters acknowledge each other. The only person who recognizes Dorn is his father played by Michael Caine. One could argue that they are trying to keep anonymous as Fischer is present. Or perhaps Dorn dreamt up the whole movie and only the end is the real part.Nolan is a great technical director, the special efforts are great and not overdone, and the movie grips the audience much like a roller coaster. But the script is a bit spotty, the plot perhaps deliberately muddled and the emotional story of Dorn and his wife doesn't quite unfold. None of the actors except Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon- Levitt really make the best use of their roles. Leonardo was solid but he's had better performances. Michael Caine's role is innocuous, but quite charming. Marion Cotillard is effective and plays a significant role but perhaps we could see more of her. Nolan surpasses Memento but doesn't match up to the Matrix which still holds the lead for mind-bending action-scifi. Regardless, as Alfred Hitchcock raised the mystery to an art form, Nolan pushes the complex sci-fi thriller. In the end, he isn't quite a master as Hitchcock, but he remains one of the finer directors today.",NA
"john-davis3224","13 March 2013","This show is excellent. No doubt about it. But so much of this show is an absolute rip off from the anime movie Paprika by Satoshi Kon. As much as I would like this show if it wasn't for not having seen Paprika first, the only problem is, I have.It ain't exactly the same. But I felt its close enough. Implanting a memory through a dream, that's the exact same premise of both stories.For anyone who has seen Paprika, you may find an awful lot of similarities here and it is truly showing that America needs to find something better to do than copy other people's works.Nevertheless, besides my cynical behaviour, I applaud this series for what it has managed to achieve to do, as it has one of the greatest fan bases a modern movie can ask for and I still don't feel that it is overrated. I just feel that it was far too similar to Paprika.",NA
"Eumenides_0","6 August 2010","Like many people anxious to watch Inception, I spent many hours online reading news, watching trailers, and just sharing my enthusiasm about it. Then I began reading weird rumours about the film involving time travelling (it doesn't) and other potential spoilers, and I decided it was time to get away from the hubbub and wait for it in isolation. I wanted to watch the film as purely as possible. I only allowed myself one treat; I didn't resist listening to my beloved Hans Zimmer's score in advance. I never imagined my feelings about the music would reflect my feelings about the film. I expected an exquisite delicacy and instead got a steak with fries. And afterwards I was still hungry.By now word of mouth has taken all the secrecy away from the story, so let's be brief about it. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, the leader of a criminal crew that infiltrates the minds of people during their sleep to steal their ideas and sell them. After a botched assignment, Cobb and his partner, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt), are hired by Saito (Ken Watanabe) to do the reverse: instead of stealing an idea, they must implant an idea in a victim's subconscious, implant it so deeply that he won't doubt it came from himself. The victim is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the heir of an energetic mega-conglomerate that threatens to have monopoly over half the world's energy supply. The idea is to convince him to dismantle this empire. For this epic assignment Cobb hires the architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), the forger Eames (Tom Hardy) and the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao).Inception has the best ensemble cast I've seen so far this year. That doesn't mean it has the best acting – I think that honour still goes to Shutter Island, which had heartbreaking performances by Ben Kingsley and DiCaprio himself. But the viewer can be sure that a film that contains all the talent mentioned above plus Marion Cottilard plus cameos by Michael Caine, Lukas Haas, Tom Berenger and Pete Postlethwaite, is at least captivating on account of all the charisma walking in and out of the screen every two seconds.I think the film needs all this charisma to satisfy because it doesn't offer much else in terms of entertainment. One of the greatest crimes a film that takes place in dreams within dreams within dream within dreams (yes, you counted it right), can be accused of is being visually dull. Anyone who saw the trailer has nothing else to look forward to, it's all there: the zero gravity hallway fight scene, the city folding, the snow power station attack, the collapsing urban landscapes. The film only expands on the trailer, it has no other impressive scene. Any artist worth his salt only uses dreams as a theme if he wants to show something visually interesting. Dreams aren't held by physical laws; they're limitless, strange, threatening. In Christopher Nolan's world, however, I can see stranger dreams if I just look outside my window.Christopher Nolan is not a particularly inventive filmmaker. There's no visual exuberance in his films. I noticed this when he turned Gotham City, a wonderfully Gothic and oppressive landscape in the Batman comic books, into a replica of any American city. Midas' touch turns things into gold. But Nolan's touch turns uniqueness into banality. Not even dreams are safe from him. Defenders will rise to say that the realism of the dreams is the point. But then why dreams? Who makes a film about Mozart to ignore his music? Many will also say that Inception is a strange film. That's arguable, of course. It's ambiguous enough to allow several interpretations. But it makes sense most of the time. Good writing and good editing contribute to that. I think this is also what made Nolan's previous attempt at a mind-boggling film, The Prestige, so satisfying. He's a fair director. He takes time to show everything the viewer needs to know to understand what's going on, and the film's rhythm is slow. Inception is strange in the sense that other mainstream, but quirkier than average, films are called strange, like The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It's strange in a very limited way, custom-made for audiences that have been deprived of strangeness for so long that they can't recognise it anymore; it's a strangeness that hardly brings dignity to the true strangeness unleashed by Wojciech Has' The Hourglass Sanatorium or Jan Svankmajer's Faust.This banality applies even to the action. There are directors who've revolutionised the way action is filmed: John Woo, the Wachowski brothers, even Michael Bay. But Inception, with the exception of the inventive hallway fight scene, leaves much to be desired. Car chases and gun fights play out much the way we expect, with little elegance or imagination.Inception's saving grace is that, for an action thriller, the main character is far more complex and engaging than usual. Cobb is a man tormented by past horrors, separated from his children, running away for a crime he didn't commit. When he enters dreams his subconscious takes the form of his dead wife, Mal (Cottilard), always ready to foil his plans. Cobb isn't just a cool thief but a man trying to get his life back and DiCaprio makes him effortlessly sympathetic.I don't know why, but I feel bad for not liking Inception more. Cinema certainly needs ambitious films that mix intellect with action; that dare to be unique while being familiar. Inception is a respectable failure, in my view, but is a step in the right direction. I hope at least it inspires other filmmakers to move in the same direction.",NA
"rooee","16 July 2010","Christopher Nolan's disappointing follow-up to The Dark Knight has an intriguing enough premise. It's just a pity the man himself couldn't have settled for a ""Story by"" credit and let someone else – perhaps his brother? – take up the quill and ink. Because the only respite we get from the barrage of exposition occurs during one of the many exciting, imaginative action sequences. (The cliff-side finale is not among them, sadly.) Perhaps Nolan wanted to make absolutely sure that the audience knew what was at stake by the time the corridors started to flip and the subconscious snow started tumbling down the mountain. Even his symbolism is spelled out, lest we miss a moment of the craftsman's genius: it's like watching Tarkovsky with the writer's commentary blaring over the top.As you may or may not (or even wish to) know, the plot involves a moody widower (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team of Wall Street extras infiltrating the subconscious of the son (Cillian Murphy) of a wealthy businessman (Pete Postlethwaite). Being a self-proclaimed mind-bender doesn't excuse the series of convolutions that puts the team at actual risk, but suffice to say, down this deep we're pretty much in the Wes Craven school of dying in your sleep, or near enough.Leonardo DiCaprio is at his spitting best; Joseph Gordon-Levitt is wasted on action duties; Michael Caine is... oh no, he's gone; Marion Cotillard screams like a cat; Tom Hardy shines.For me, the most disappointing aspect lies in the fact that this is a dream film without a single, solitary dream-like image. Nothing uncanny, eerie, unsettling or psychologically askew. Perhaps this is how Nolan dreams – in solidly defined 'levels', with straight-lined origami cities, empty of metaphor or oneiric imagery. Nolan's dreamscape is a pristine museum, carefully and verbosely labelled, occasionally confusing, but not in a fun way; ultimately nothing more than a playground for confident men in tailored suits.",NA
"GFDTommasino","4 February 2011","In my opinion the IMDb review by Carl_Tait from New York, NY is about the best summation of the film. A great concept but lost in translation. And to think Mr. Nolan wrote the story for ""Inception""!!! I include ""Inception"" among the film genre that have come to be known as ""mind**ck"" films. I don't agree with every list of films characterized thus on the web but this is an unmistakable genre. And ""Inception"" definitely belongs there.I suspect there are a lot of viewers out there who see a complex but convoluted film and find it gripping because BAM!! it hits them so hard on the head that they dare not concede they don't understand it because they are afraid someone will find out that they didn't :-) But there are a number of IMDb reviewers who have given ""Inception"" 10/10 or close to that rating. The way these reviewers have articulated their reasoning is definitely more comprehensible and cogent than the film is in my opinion. I wish Mr. Nolan had consulted them before making the film as I am sure they could bring some clarity to the mix.To my mind ""Inception"" has a convoluted and twisted narrative (if there is one) which *seems* multi-layered, but actually throws just about everything it can into the mix, never mind the sink, it throws in even the kitchen itself. I will say that the CGI effects are pretty amazing. But the film is overpopulated with characters and it was hard to figure out why more than half of them were there.And as another reviewer commented, what the heck are the guns and explosions doing in a film based on a shared dream paradigm.""Inception"" gave me no reason to care for any of the characters, excepting to some degree Ellen Page's character Ariadne. I had no reason to care for Marion Cotillard's character Mal, and found her portrayal somewhat of a female stereotype playing the neurotic unhinged foil.I am sure Mr. Nolan is an excellent film maker who has definitely come into his own as far as the box office is concerned. But so far the only films he has done that I have truly admired are ""Insomnia"" and ""Batman Begins"". Before ""Batman Begins"" I was never a fan of any of the Batman films.While watching ""Inception"" there was many a time that I felt like stopping and watching something else but gave it the benefit of doubt that the film might pick-up. Sorry to say it never did.I do hope Mr.Nolan gives a little more attention to maintaining a narrative and character development in his films rather than just bombarding us with complexity (or more accurately confusion!) and CGI effects.All I can say is that ""Inception"" is exhausting viewing and represents complexity for the sake of complexity or something like that.....",NA
