"ccthemovieman-1","7 March 2006","Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.Now, several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.Anyway, ""Fellowship,"" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.","

"bonnie91","14 April 2006","The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the ""good"" characters, but also with the ""evil"" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!","

"adamscastlevania2","11 November 2014","(95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy, then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving.","

"MrGilgamesh","15 February 2020","It is my firm belief that the standard versions of The Lord of the Rings should be jettisoned in favour of the extended editions universally. Sure, the near 4 hour runtime is a tad steep, but for an absolute masterpiece like this, it's work every second and the first act of undoubtedly the best trilogy in cinematic history!","

"Leofwine_draca","19 August 2016","Director Peter Jackson and wife Fran Walsh have successfully created an epic movie in both look and feel to equal J. R. R. Tolkien's novel (itself awarded the title of ""book of the century""), bringing to the big screen a film nearly flawless in its execution. My biggest disappointment is that two chapters are missing from the novel - Tom Bombadil and the following encounter with the barrow-wrights - but everything else is present and correct.Visually the film is stunning, and Jackson's decision to shoot it entirely in New Zealand is one that pays off. From the incredibly lush green opening scenes of the Shire, to the enchanting elvish woods, to the imposing mountains and plains, it really is a great film to look at and enjoy the backdrop. Even the computer-generated images, like that of Mount Doom, are pretty realistic. Jackson's fluid camera leads to some great sweeping shots through orc-infested mines, huge towers, cameras in places you've never dreamed of. The soundtrack is also perfect, with Howard Shore's suspenseful, exciting, and emotional score a real plus, especially with the cool chanting that fills the Mines of Moria sequence. On top of this, great stuff is done with sound effects - in particular one scene involving a horn suddenly blowing had me jumping in my seat with its realism.I don't really need to examine the story, because it sticks closely to the book with so few minor changes that it's impeccable. The script is intelligent and well-written, the characters charismatic and believable in the situations they encounter. Despite a three hour running time, the film never drags, even in some of the slower sequences - I just didn't want it to be over while I was watching it. The costumes, sets and appearances - down to the hobbits' hairy feet - are all exactly as you would picture them in the book. Jackson's bizarre, arty depiction of life in the ""netherworld"" when Frodo puts on the ring and becomes invisible is as good as it could ever have been - spooky, supernatural and utterly weird. Lighting, pacing, suspense, tension, and the rest - it's all here and done 100% correctly for an overall brilliant effect.Elijah Wood seemed an odd choice to me for the lead role, but I immediately fell in love with his character. Through his acting he creates an emotional, weak in body but strong in spirit hero, a real centre piece for the film to evolve around, and the film makes great use of the actor's slightly odd eyes (especially in the sequence in which he nearly becomes a wraith). Ian McKellen is also excellent as Gandalf and seems to have been perfectly cast in the role, making it his own. Then there's the fellowship itself - Viggo Mortensen excels as the proud and just Strider (later Aragorn), especially in the action stakes where he fights with such fierce determination that he's a presence to behold. Orlando Bloom is fine as the elf warrior Legolas, and moves as fast with his bow as he does in the book. Screen stalwart John Rhys-Davies IS Gimli the dwarf, and couldn't be better. Then there's Sean Astin - lovable as the dopey but loyal Sam Gamgee, and Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan in slight comic relief roles as hobbit buddies Pip and Merry. Finally, kudos to Sean Bean, for creating in Boromir a flawed but deeply likable and understandable character, with a sympathetic performance that eclipses all of the actor's previous work - bravo.The action sequences are magnificent and really get the heart going - they put you into the middle of the action with all the blood, sweat and clanging steel, and are edge-of-the-seat stuff. Highlights include Strider fighting the ring-wraiths with his burning brand on Weathertop and the final assault by orcs on the fellowship, which leads to one of the most noble deaths ever in a film. And what of the special effects? In a film dominated by CGI work, I'm happy to say that most are unnoticeable. The digital manipulation to create four-foot hobbits is sometimes dodgy but most of the time you don't notice. The backdrops and effects are great, expensive looking but solid and real at the same time - whoever said they look ""cartoony"" just got it wrong.My favourite scene in the movie is the Mines of Moria sequence - a fantasy fan's dream come true, and the best on screen depiction of a Dungeons & Dragons game so far. The lurker in the lake is a Lovecraftian monster par excellence and the spooky and atmospheric trip through the corpse-strewn deserted mines exceptionally eerie stuff. Then follows a fantastic battle with a cave troll, thankfully on screen for a fair amount of time so we get to admire the fluid and superb effects, and then a truly gob-smacking encounter with the fiery Balrog, just as you imagine it from the book. This half an hour is probably the best film sequence I've ever seen, flawless and perfect in its depiction - amazing. A highlight of what is an impressive and epic film throughout, and a must see for any film fan worth their salt - I can't recommend this film highly enough, and plan to watch it again before the cinema run expires. In my opinion this is better than any STAR WARS movie or HARRY POTTER - and easily one of the best fantasy movies ever made, although it has to be said the competition isn't exactly stiff. Bring on the sequel!","

"NRGWasp","2 May 2002","Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!","

"classicsoncall","22 December 2005","When I first read ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy back in the early 1970's, I recall saying to myself that the story would make a wonderful movie. ""Star Wars"" still hadn't come out yet, and realizing that the available technology could not do justice to the fantastic world presented by J.R.R. Tolkien, it was simply best left to the imagination.Well, imagination has found life in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", a truly profound epic that sets the standard for film fantasy, just as the books did for the written word. Upon first seeing it during it's initial release, I couldn't have been happier with the amount of detail it offered while remaining true to the original adventure. Everyone imagines what a story and characters look like in their own mind; it was as if Peter Jackson tapped a great cosmic consciousness to deliver a tale that captured the tone and pacing of the novel dead on.I feel that readers of the trilogy have a leg up on the characters and locations of Middle Earth, as they are revealed in the film quickly and with nominal explanation. For example, when the Black Riders appear for the first time, it's difficult to grasp what they're all about, other than the fact that they're after the ring. Strider's explanation of the Nazgul is perfect - ring wraiths who were once men, neither alive nor dead, who always feel the power of the ring. Coming to the movie with that understanding ahead of time helps the viewer have a greater appreciation of the action taking place.The real magic of the movie for me is the seamless manner in which the various races coexist and interact with each other. Though levels of unfamiliarity and distrust appear, can anyone coming out of the movie doubt that elves, dwarfs, hobbits and wizards actually exist. Even orcs and evil Uruk hai have a place in this world, for without the danger they pose there is no triumph.If the movie captures your imagination and you haven't read the trilogy or it's prequel ""The Hobbit"", you'll be doing yourself a favor to do so. There in even more exquisite detail are nuances such as Elvish poetry and additional characters that provide more depth and color to the world of Middle Earth. It's a world easy to get lost in, and makes one appreciate a writer of legendary proportion who invented a land, people, and language all of his own that can now be shared with everyone.","

Story begins with this line.This line is not really the first line but the line stars the movie for real. This movie is breathtaking. Whatever I say is not enough for this trilogy. Brilliant novel, brilliant adapted screenplay.Not just the novel or screenplay is excellent but the technics also revolutionary. The trilogy nearly opened a new era to Cinema. Some believed even more revolutionary than Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Amazing makeup, breathtaking visual effects, stunning cinematography.

"fearfulofspiders","26 August 2008","Barely ever hearing of The Lord of the Rings, I went in to see this film in theaters the consecutive Friday it was released, to not only be flabbergasted at its greatness, but wanting more! Since then, I devoted myself to seeing the following two films on the first day of release -- a promise I kept.Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece not only carries a great deal of the text to full film fruition, but shows the power of film, and proving that nothing is impossible. Jackson's vision is continuous, and never seems to loose grasp of the story that is being told. Using the artistry of John Howe and Alan Lee, The Fellowship of the Ring gleams with a beautiful and dark atmosphere, a length of detail that makes it seem like everyone and everything has its own history, and full of wondrous images one could never imagine.The acting is superb. With a complex script, each actor has transformed these characters into 3-D people with deep back-story, and people that we feel compassion for. This is one extraordinary ensemble cast. Each actor IS that character, making it seem impossible to imagine anyone else fill that person's shoe in their stead. Viggo Mortensen IS Aragorn. Sir Ian McKellen IS Gandalf the Grey. Elijah Wood IS Frodo Baggins. One could weep with our heroes should one fall, or feel inspired when they achieve victory. A fantasy with this much emotion just seems surreal, but it's completely believable.Never losing pace, the writing and direction is flawless, making for one enthralling introduction into Middle-earth. The voice over prologue fills even the most uneducated audience member with all the necessary knowledge they need to know in order to understand our heroes' and villains' motives. Some things of course have been omitted for pacing reasons. While not present in the theatrical cut, we do see the passing of the Grey Elves, and get a brief tale of Beren and Luthien. The barrow-wights and their story is no where to be seen (as interesting as it is in the book, there really is no place for it in this film) and Tom Bombadil is absent as well, but thankfully to the ingeniousness of the writers, in the Extended Edition of The Two Towers a little homage is paid to the character. Omissions and changes are always part of adapting a book to film, and the ones made by Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh are justifiable in every way.The action scenes are spaced out thoroughly enough for breathing room, plot advancement, and ever-continuing character development. Each action scene is its own, be it the flight to the Fjords of Bruinen, the Mines of Moria, or the showdown at Amon Hen near the end of the film. All are greatly choreographed, each stunt member and actor is full of energy and ambition as they wield deadly weapons at each others' heads and limbs. It really is a sight to behold.The special effects are mesmerizing. The use of CGI, miniatures/bigatures, and even clever camera angles blend to make one ideal image after the other. The soaring images of Barad-dur or Orthanc seem real when in fact, they only stand so many feet high. The Argonath, two figures of enormous height standing before the Anduin River seem like 300 foot creations, when in fact they are about only several feet off the ground. Simply jaw-dropping imagery.Howard Shore's score for The Fellowship of the Ring is a beautiful, epic, and complex piece of work that makes one feel like they have been entranced. Even when some of the text seems omitted from the screen, it can be heard through the powerful instrumentation conducted and created by this composer. The use of leitmotifs to symbolize a country, race, or character is stunning.Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring is a visionary masterpiece, allowing the world to see what seems like actual history with fantastic elements, equaling the greatness of Hollywood's earlier classics. As the first of three, one who has not seen these films can await the next several hours of their lives to be changed for ever.","

"mstomaso","30 November 2007","Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement. This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1, 2, and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be self-contained, but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs, though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases.The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people (Hobbits)to help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45, and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life, a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself, he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth  The One Ring. This ring is evil incarnate, with an insatiable lust for power, it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator  Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear, as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring, he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred, Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly, the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire.At this point, we are about 1/6th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter, it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship, and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled ""Fellowship"", they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel  by example not discourse. For example, we are given hints to the identity of Strider (Mortenson) earlier on in the movie than in the novel, but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize, Peter Jackson, his team and cast  NAIL the characterization. The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well (Strider/Aragorn and Gandalf), but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody mis-steps, and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them.Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice, and until this trilogy, he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy, they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books, expanding and contracting, rearranging, and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books, but not well explained, in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen (Liv Tyler), daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn, for example, is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books.The Howard Shore score is lovely, and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great, and, though they feature some prominent performers  are never weighed down by star-power.Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity, and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and post-production work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work, he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So, he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries, but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package. The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen, the essentials, the characters, and the overall story are not just recognizable, but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining, but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world.Very highly recommended.","

"minionlost","11 December 2001","Breathtaking.  Unique.  Captivating.  Enchanting.Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen.  And we had nearly three hours to go.The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth.  And believe me, it is BIG.  Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters.  Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time.  The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades.  I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so.  The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft.  We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year.  George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.For everyone else: don't you dare miss it.","

"dee.reid","3 August 2005","...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since ""Star Wars"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the ""PG-13"" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get ""into"" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and ""The Enemy,"" who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (""live"" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a ""fellowship of the ring."" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called ""The Lord of the Rings"" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10/10","

"Rinaear","8 October 2002","It is with no surprise that Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film has received such mixed critics. Many viewers refer to it as being childish, boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien's books, destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it's first publication.Having read the books several years ago, I went to see this `impossible' film when it came out with many doubts on my mind. I really liked it, but left the theater with as many doubts as I had before. Was it perfect? Well, maybe not, but what an achievement. After watching it a few times on DVD, and thinking about it for some time now, I find myself loving this film more and more. Let me tell you why...The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called `Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.Peter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road, for example, is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example, and it captures that feeling of danger, density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story, and made some right choices along the way. If the so called `purists' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether, it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it's own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book, the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained, and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story, that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still, after some consideration, I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson, and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says `I will take the ring'. It is there at Moria's Gate, and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn't fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds, that takes time to unfold, it's tale branching in every direction.I could go on and on, talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection, but I'll end saying that deep down, this is not about action, beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film, to me, is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night, I came to understand what this thing of `mankind' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power, the importance and value of friendship, the inevitability of growing up, the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic, and be a new bearer to it's message of humanism, is a statement to it's greatness. Gandalf's words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the world, and have a part to play in the destiny of all, are immortal.In the end, this is a wonderful film, but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy, beauty and humanity. I believe Tolkien would have liked that.","

"mrashtastic89","3 January 2022","It took me 14 years and a subscription to HBO Max to get around to watching this movie, and I can certainly say it was worth every bit of hype it gets. The Fellowship of the Ring was an epic start and one of the best fantasy adventure films I've ever seen. These action sequences are immaculate, and it is a gorgeously directed movie, the cinematography was so good I couldn't get enough.It's also very, very funny, who knew Sean Astin, who I love, would grow up to be a hobbit, every actor in this gives a really great performance, and these special effects are top-tier, they're unbelievable.The Fellowship of the Ring also has one of the greatest climaxes I've ever seen, not only that, it has incredible creatures that actually scared me.Yes, it is very, very long with a runtime of nearly 3 hours, but it never drags despite that.Peter Jackson had a vision here, and it was an amazing vision, along with a story that was epic.And I'm gonna give Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring an A+","

"david-meldrum","26 April 2022","It's possible we've become too familiar with this film and its two successors. Time, and multiple rewatching as, can cause us to forget how impossible the whole project seemed before the world saw it; we forget how strange and independent spirited parts of it are; we forget the references too and evidence of Jackson's roots in horror cinema; we forget the narrative excitement that propels a film adapted from a source that is more discursive, more of a scene-setter. Changes made from the text aid this, and the result is thrilling and wonder-inducing. It's a masterful piece of epic fantasy cinema, and the whole trilogy's place in my heart is secure.","

"Puroo","21 June 2021","I had begun watching The Lord of the Rings because of all the memes and references in other movies and shows. And that was probably an excellent decision. It has been a year since I have watched these and since the story is distributed among all the three movies, I have decided that I will talk about something unique each of them. In total these movies clock over 10 hours, and I can imagine how much the fans of the book must have loved it when they learnt they are getting so much content from a book they love reading so much.The Fellowship of the Ring is the very first one of the movies which basically kickstarts the adventure. It is amazing to see how much content this movie has in spite of the fact that the entire backstory was narrated in the first two minutes of the beginning. There are a lot of things to talk about in this. The movie created a font style, a score and a colour palette that fits along with the scenes of the battle that made it look so suspenseful. As the scene was going on I was very attentive to hear everything that happens throughout. And this was just the first two minutes of the 3 hour movie.Afterwards the scene transitioned to the otherwise peaceful Hobbiton. It was a very interesting transition, that showed how on one hand the races are fighting each other for getting control over the Middle Earth, while on the other hand there are a bunch of peace loving Hobbits who are just into their day to day lives. They always have very wholesome reactions when they see Gandalf, which is the reason why it creates a stark contrast from what is about to happen after they leave Hobbiton. Although Bilbo was a good friend of Gandalf and Gandalf had come all the way to celebrate his birthday, he didn't feel that Bilbo was a trustworthy person because he was also attached to the ring. As a result he decided to send his nephew Frodo, his friend Sam and two other Hobbits to help dispose of the ring.The ring is also something I'd like to talk about here, since it is in this movie that the ring and its effects have been talked about the most. The ring is something that appeals to anyone who has desires, but once it is worn it ends up tormenting the wearer. The subtle message that this sends us is the consequence of a moment's greed. Not everyone has the ability to hold their temptation, which is the reason why the Hobbits are specifically sent to dispose of it. Frodo himself has the urge to wear it twice, the reason being that he wanted to save himself. At one moment he wears it accidentally during a bar fight, which makes him see the Eye of Modor and makes him vulnerable. If one is able to get over their desires and focus on what makes their life easy, there will be no need of such temptations. This is what the ring tells us.And afterwards they go to Rivendell, which is, simply said, the most beautiful place I have ever seen in my whole life in any movie! Over there they create The Fellowship of the Ring, which goes to destroy the ring in the lava at the Mountain of Doom. Now I won't get too much into the story since I want to keep this review spoiler-free, so I'm just gonna talk about how beautiful all the scenes from this movie are. Seeing them reminded me of my childhood, reading nursery rhymes and fairy tales. I always looked at the pictures and imagined this is what those places must have looked like. Every location from this movie looks like it could be one of those 19th century paintings. It's amazing to see such places are still left in this world that have not been destroyed as of yet.The movie, or should I say the trilogy, has really gone hard with the details. They chose to make the maps, the fonts, the detailed lore, all the cities from the Middle Earth and even the easter eggs which added a lot of lore to the movie. Every scene from the movie looks like a painting, which is not something which can be said about most adventure fantasy movies. It has the feeling of an RPG game to it, or at least that's how I feel it. It's something of a Skyrim of all movies. For the fans this must have felt like a dream coming true. Things like these should be made for all fantasy movies, which have begun looking underworked simply because of the existence of this movie.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is not a movie that I may want to watch again because of how long it was and the fact that it is nothing in itself unless the other two parts are also combined, but this is also for a good thing because of the fond memories that this movie has left for me. Personally this was the most memorable movie for me among the trilogy. It was because of how rich and detailed this movie was that gave me the confidence of watching the other two movies as well, something I rarely do otherwise. There are many iconic movies like The Godfather, Jurassic Park and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs which I did like, but they didn't give me the courage to continue. This is going to be one of those classical movies that I'd remember for life.","

"Theo Robertson","16 August 2002","I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming "" This is our film "" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying "" Give us Tom , give us Nicole , get Harrison , get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans , this is our baby "" to which the producers gave a firm and resounding "" No "" . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known - but not megastar - actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good jobThe other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is - Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS - they're too easy to kill .There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain.I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book , people who have never read the book , enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS","

"Hitchcoc","2 March 2006","I am not fanatic, though I have read the books a couple of times. My interest in J. R. R. Tolkien goes to his knowledge of the history of language as well as his work in fantasy. I've seen some of the bad animation that was done using his work. I always assumed that this would be the only vehicle that could be used to bring these works to the screen. Now with a new generation of special effects masters, we have a work of art like the world has never seen. Granted, there can never be a definitive work that matches the depth and poetry of the books, but this captures the charm, the wonder, the amazing epic. To see the Shire presented in the first scenes and the party in the home of Bilbo as the creatures of this amazing fantasy are exposed is one of those incredible moments. The story is set up for the ultimate adventure as Frodo paddles out onto that lake, not knowing what has been set in motion. I will leave the real reviews to others. My first thought upon seeing this was, I just hope I survive to see it to its conclusion.","

"preppy-3","3 January 2002","Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on.  All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie.  The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in, but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real.  All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking.  The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by.  The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating).  It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids.  Still, it's the best film of 2001.  SEE IT!!!!","

"Mr_PCM","28 February 2006","There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making.Where do you start when reviewing a film the size of Lord of the Rings? J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal masterwork, long considered unfilmable, has made it on to the screen thanks to visionary director Peter Jackson. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three books of the trilogy. Everyone has their favourite of the three, and this one is probably mine. Unrivalled in its size and scale by virtually any other film, with new groundbreaking special and digital effects, a stunning musical score, universally superb acting and most importantly a superb story.The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the epic trilogy that tells of the quest of a hobbit to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. Many threats face him on his long journey, both from the world around him and from his companions, who could be tempted by the power of the ring he has set out to destroy. It is a tale of magic and fantasy, swords and sorcery, but it is not simply for teens who enjoy dungeons and dragons games. It is accessible to everyone. By turns exciting, frightening, funny and sad, it is a true masterpiece in terms of storytelling, encompassing the full spectrum of emotions.The acting is superb from the entire cast, and it is unfathomable as to how the Academy overlooked the acting entirely for all three films when dishing out awards and nominations. However the performances from Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood and Sean Bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair to single any one out for an award.The film also contains some groundbreaking computer-generated special effects, and some positively genius scale work. Due to hobbits being only about 3 feet tall, some clever scale work was needed in order to ensure that John Rhys-Davies, a dwarf in the film but over 6 feet tall in real life, did in fact look the height of a dwarf. This was done through clever use of forced perspectives, scale doubles, giant sets and blue screen filming. However, the most impressive use of computer effects lies later in the trilogy, with the appearance of Gollum  cinema's first live-action character who is completely computer generated. The music is also beautiful, and Howard Shore has created possibly the most iconic and memorable score since John Williams' Star Wars.Peter Jackson has, until Lord of the Rings, been seen as a director outside of the mainstream, but his superb, career-defining work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has seen him well and truly propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood. He has re-defined the epic film with unparalleled success, and created films that will definitely stand the test of time, to one day be thought of with the same reverence as the Star Wars and Godfather trilogies.A major milestone in cinema history, the trilogy would eventually gain seventeen Oscars between the three films. Lord of the Rings is a master class in storytelling, and essential viewing.","

The music, the landscapes, the characters, and of course the story, all come together in perfect melody. Tolkien created this magical world and story, but Jackson brought it to us in a way we never thought possible. And the best part was... there were two more movies after this.","

I don't care what the Academy says because without a doubt, it was the best film of 2001 (obviously... i said it was the best movie I've ever seen). It deserved the Academy Award 10 times more than A Beautiful Mind did. I mean look at the difference between ratings. LOTR: #3 ABM: #126 See a difference? LOTR will go on to be an unforgotten movie as what Star Wars is. In twenty years ABM won't even be on the top 250 list, while LOTR will still be in the top 50. SO LOTR fans just remember. Academy doesn't mean sh*t. Time says it all.","

"Geeky Randy","29 November 2014","An absolutely gorgeous adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's first LORD OF THE RINGS installment detailing how well-meaning young hobbit Wood unwittingly inherits a ring from his adventurous uncle Holm which possesses a dark force that is powerful enough to end all life in Middle-Earth. Visually wondrous even for those who aren't that into the fantasy genre. This installment is particularly charming for less action and more character development and, for some reason, the Middle-Earth lingo works really well in this movie over the second and third films. Although FELLOWSHIP merely teases the viewer with the appearance of Gollum—while TWO TOWERS and RETURN are basically owned by Serkis as Tolkien's timelessly wretched creature who's not quite friend or foe—the movie is just too lovable to really even need his inclusion. McKellen is perfect as Gandalf the Grey, and Bean's performance brings to the foreground the genius of all these characters who suffers from similar temptations and weaknesses that we do in reality. It is FELLOWSHIP that holds the clearest mirror up to us, while the following two films kind of just linger in the wartime aftermath. The greatest fantasy film of all-time.**** (out of four)","

"Koola","4 December 2001","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Today is my birthday. Honestly, it is. It has been a beautiful week. Actually, it has been more than beautiful. The first snow has slowly covered our trees, the cool winterair has boldly taken over the days and nights in Norway. Beautiful. Well, actually, it has been more than beautiful. But what is `more than beautiful'? Today it was the point where a touch of evil was added to the beautiful. And with the evil and the beautiful comes. well, you know where I am getting at. A thrilling adventure, ancientic tale-greatness, monstrous experiences and totally - with no doubts whatsoever - the one film to rule them all. And in MY MIND, bind me. to this film, this book, forever. From heart of someone who has not read the book, nor have any interest in Tolkien, but loves cinema more than anything in the world. this is one of my, if not THE, all-time cinematic moments.Norway is a small country. And for the small country - only one press screening of FOTR. A small bit about me. I love film, and work as a filmjournalist here in Oslo. Therefore I attended this press-screening. My relation to LOTR is quite simple. Have not read the book, but have been covering the developments of the films. And by that, I have grown a huge interest for the project. Enough now. I HAD AN URGE TO REVIEW THIS MOVIE. Because it is beyond anything I could expect, want, crave, imagine, desire, feel, anticipate. This is unimaginable. And when you see it. I found myself crying of nothing but admiration 2 minutes into the prologue (shiveringly spoken by Blanchett). It shows this dark lord, Sauron, and tells a the fascinating story of The One Ring. Now, excuse me for not being OBSESSIVELY AWARE of everything about this movie (or these books) before seeing or writing this. The prologue is nothing but a amazing sequence. Instead of going into each and every picture (frame) of this film (because I could, and there would be a lot to gaze at and analyse in every single one of them), I will say this: THERE IS SO MUCH. I was completely paralysed. I love every detail I could observe, from the complex battlescenes to the single face of mister Frodo Baggins bedazzling every single audience member. It was a fantastic experience. This review, as I can see, will turn into a not-cronologic piece, but forgive me - my thoughts are a bit hard to recollect. My mind is occupied with images that have burned hard to my iris, performances that I already love and quote. I walked out of the theater 7 hours ago.I have not read the books, as you can see. Now I have seen the first film, and a big bouldering voice tells me that I might have had this very experience many years earlier, by way of the book. But people, and I feel this is important to say, I've just read the book. I think. A 3 hour movie - it felt like reading a book. Because the film felt so massive, it has layers upon layers - in character, in dialogue, in scenery (oh, my lord, the set pieces. I have fallen in love with Lothlorien, the Shire. Can I go to these places for vacation? Will I ever have enough money to go to New Zealand? This is so bloody fantastic in this film. It is so fantastic! I run out of words (especially in my English :-). We must go on!There has been a few hours as I said to dwell on this movie now, buit it's coming to me. It's coming to me as a grandiose wave of river-water lifted by the spellbinding of Arwen (Liv Tyler looks so stylish, such a timeless beauty. Eventhough (some stupid, boneheaded) people are going to scream ARMAGEDDON when they see her the first time, they will be silent when this elf is riding away from the black riders - bravely coming the halfling to rescue.) to eliminate ringwraiths(?). IT IS SO VERY, VERY GOOD. (Oh, I love this film. I have to see it again. I need my mother to see this film, I need to pick up a total stranger on the street, offer her a ticket just to see her face when she's leaving the theatre. I may have given her a lifetime of. well, an experience for a lifetime. Do you hear that Peter Jackson? You may very well, with this masterpiece (I have been dying to call it that), been responsible for thousands of people suffering through this year.) I NEED TO SEE TWO TOWERS NOW!!!! WHAT AM I GOING TO DO!!?? READ THE BOOK? I have to know whats happens. That thing happening to Gandalf. I can't believe it. He must return. Tell me he returns. Ian McKellen is superior. He is great. He acts like if. well, I couldn't see him act. There is Gandalf in him. For sure. Well, anyway, I am off track.FOTR is very big. A big tale. But very small. I mean, big it is, but small is he - Frodo. Oh my gracious lord of modern cinema, the very man who gave Mr. And Mrs. The liberty to create the god given actor named Elijah. Nothing crazy about these sentences, but it is a holy great performance. He is feeling. He is a feeling. My back was cold throughout the entire movie. Feeling Frodo, being Frodo, hurting Frodo, bearing with Frodo. A class-act, truly enchanting, spectacular, it-is-no-good-words-to-compliment-enough Frodo. I am, as you just read, trying to verbalize my experience of Frodo Baggins. But this turns away from reviewing. You want to read about the content of the film. What I saw. Because most of you probably know the whole story, and all the characters. Well, let's go to what there is to see.
I saw the Shrine. It is a very richly realistic built, sunny, green place. I loved it. But no surprises. The home of Bilbo, cornfields. and then the city of Bir? Bie? Forgot the name. All the way, amazing scenery. The fact that there is a big difference in height among the characters, but not among the actors, well that is, how do I put it, flawless. Don't know how they could pull it off, but I am impressed. As I said before, this is so throughoutly worked on and polished - every picture and frame has something more than what you see, and every character blows my mind. What can I say? I'm never this singlemindledly positive about a film, but this may very well be THAT ONE where everything seems to strike my mind and in, again, the cinematic darkness bind me. Every generation has a movie. Every saga has a. hehe, enough filmrelated quotings. Don't have to say much about this, but so that you know it: Howard Shore's score is in my cd-player, and this music is. next to my heart.Bilbo. Just what did I actually know about this Bilbo. Oh, yes he was that hobbit-guy that picked up the Ring from the creature Gollum. I have read the forewords of LOTR. But oh my god. Complexity lies hidden, it seems, in each and every character. Bilbo freaked my out. Scared me more than Gollum (`my precious' shivers still in my bones). What exactly did that ring do to him? One scene has given me the most disturbance (and if someone does not want to know, please do not read further). When Frodo reaches Lothlorien, and re-meets with Bilbo, there is screen magic. As they talk (and he looks so much older already), he gives Frodo the sword. He tells about it's magic, how it glows blue when orcs are near. Ian Holm is absolutely heartbreaking as Bilbo. Then comes a moment. It hit my spine. He wants to give Frodo the armor (what was it called again?), and Frodo begins to remove his shirt. Then Bilbo sees the ring. Oh s**t, he sees the ring. Ian Holm is magic. ""Oh, can I hold it... just for one last time..."" ""No, Bilbo, stay away"". ""IT's MINE! MY RING! MY PRECIOUS!"" It is at that point. Bilbo freaks out. Make-up is brilliant, and the scare of that moment, that scene... still won't leave my body. Not even my damn mind. And the same thing happens with Galadriel. Don't want to spoil anything but the scene with Galadriel and Frodo by the mirror (she pours water in it, and he sees ""what is to come""). THIS IS MAGIC!!!! Aaahhh. Again, and I can't say this enough, I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN. Believe me, it is THAT GOOD. The film hadn't played for long, but I began to realise. what's next for Frodo. He is now the ringebearer. Look at Bilbo. Again it strikes me.. I HAVE TO SEE THE NEXT TO FILMS NOW!!! Because there is no end to this film. Actually I couldn't believe it ended when it did. I needed more. It felt like one hour tops, but I had been nailed to my seat for 3 hours already. Amazing experience. The film have no ending, and there's evil there, that does not sleep . Now you get the picture; I love this film! I love LORD OF THE RINGS. This is just remarkable. My imagination. oh, I have no imagination. I did not, could not, imagine this. Imagine there's no people. Imagine if this film had not been made. I may have lived my life without knowing this story. All of you who read the book and hate them for turning this into a movie. Think of all of us who now have been rescued from living our lives without it. Thank you, everyone behind this film, for making it.Koola from NorwayA small PS: The fellowship. It was beautifully casted. Flawless. Gimli - unforgettable John Rhys-Davies. The hobbits - just charming to their hairy feet, and they touched me deep. Aragorn and Boromir - more than anything, believable. They are men, they have no effects or make-up to characterize them. But they are massive. They suffer, and it hurts. Viggo Mortensen is my hero. (And did you all know he is related to Denmark, my neighbourcountry?). Legolas though.. He was my favourite. Feels weird to write the least about the character I loved the most, but it's just. not much to say. Could not stand seeing Legolas leave the screen, he had an remarkable impact on me with his. elvish magic. Oh, and one last thing. This is a chaos. My mind is a chaos. FOTR is so much, much more. I haven't said a thing about Galladriel, and a lot more. But there has to be a limit. If I were you now, I would look forward to every second of this film, so then. it does not matter.
I will bring this experience with me for the rest of my life. It is that good.","

"Tyson14","17 December 2014","Sixty years ago, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins came into possession of a magic ring. When he decides to leave his home in the Shire and retire, he finds it curiously difficult to leave the ring behind. Disturbed, the wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that Bilbo's trinket is actually the One Ring of legend, which the Dark Lord Sauron needs to complete his return to power. Bilbo's cousin Frodo has to take the Ring on a long and arduous journey across Middle-earth to the volcano known as Mount Doom, deep within Sauron's land of Mordor, the only place where it can be destroyed.Back in 1999, when Peter Jackson began filming The Lord of the Rings, there was an expectation of failure. A thousand-page-long book adapted into three three-hour movies by a director whose biggest previous movie had been a minor ghost comedy starring Michael J. Fox? And on a budget of only $90 million apiece at a time when $200 million+ budgets for such epic films were becoming more commonplace? It seemed like a recipe for disaster.Against the odds, Jackson pulled it off. The trilogy as a whole is a remarkable work, translating Tolkien's vision onto the screen with - for the most part - respect and integrity. There are missteps, mistakes and some ill-conceived changes, but these are mostly restricted to the second and third films in the sequence. The Fellowship of the Ring, on the other hand, is moved from page to screen with enviable skill.The main key to the film's success is the casting. Elijah Wood may be a lot younger than Frodo in the novel, but he sells Frodo's mix of book- learned wisdom with a lack of practical experience with wide-eyed enthusiasm. Representing the old guard, veteran actors Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Christopher Lee bring their roles of Gandalf, Bilbo and Saruman to life with presence and gravitas. The actors are pretty much all excellent, even Cate Blanchett as she struggles with a curiously-written interpretation of Galadriel. Marton Csokas is probably the film's weakest acting link as Celeborn, but given he has about twenty seconds of screen time, this is not a major issue. I must also admit to not being altogether convinced by Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn the King, but as Strider the Ranger in this first film he is superb.In terms of scripting and changes from the books, some key sequences are missing. Tom Bombadil is gone (which is a wise move), as are the barrow- wights (which is more regrettable) and other elements are compressed (the journey from the Shire to Bree, which covers dozens of pages in the book, happens instantly on-screen) or eliminated altogether (Fatty Bolger, the 'Fifth Hobbit', is exorcised from events). Other events that happened in the book off-page or only in flashback occur here in their correct chronological order, such as Saruman's confrontation with Gandalf at Isengard.For the most past these changes are well-judged, even if some fan- favourite moments are left out. For a three-hour movie the pacing is generally excellent, with a good mix of exposition, character-building moments and action set pieces. The movie's effects are impressive, with CGI being held back and used only when absolutely necessary, with miniatures often employed to give physical locations a sense of presence and weight. Whilst clearly resulting from budgetary restrictions, this prevents the film getting buried under fake-looking CGI and means it still has more convincing effects than the recent first Hobbit movie, which feels a little silly.It's difficult to pick a stand-out moment from the film. The Black Riders pursuing the Hobbits is an evocative moment, as is the confrontation on Weathertop and the flooding at the Fords of Bruinen. The outstanding sequence is probably the descent through Moria, which features both excellent character moments (such as Gandalf's conversation with Frodo when they discover that Gollum is pursuing them), humour (Pippin's encounter with a skeleton on a well), action (the battle with the cave troll in the chamber of Mazarbul) and tragic horror (Gandalf's last stand on the bridge of Khazad-dumb). The whole sequence is a joy to watch.The film missteps a little near the end: the trip to Lorien, where the Fellowship regroups after Moria, made sense in the book but in the film it dangerously comes close to killing the pace of the movie altogether. This is not helped by the somewhat bizarre characterisation of Galadriel. Jackson is to be commended for trying to make the longueur work, but ultimately it feels like it's delaying the film's climax too much at the moment it should be ramping up towards it. Fortunately, in the cinematic edition it's a fairly brief sequence. Events culminate in the epic battle on Amon Hen, with Sean Bean delivering a stand-out performance during Boromir's last stand and Sean Astin's Sam getting his first notable moments in the film's cliffhanger ending.The movie's success is furthered by some truly remarkable production design and the quite astonishing soundtrack by Howard Shore, which must rank as one of the finest movie soundtracks of all time.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring remains, thirteen years on, one the finest fantasy movies ever made. The writing, acting and effects work all combine and work in tandem with one another to produce something very special, something that Peter Jackson has struggled to replicate ever since.","

"Aaron1375","7 January 2002","I didn't know quite what to expect when I went into the theater, all I knew is that I wanted to see a fantasy film with sword fights, magic and monsters.  I was not disappointed.  It exceeded my expectations because it had all the stuff I mentioned and great acting, and good character development as well.  I was enjoying the movie so much that I was very disappointed when it ended.  I would have gladly stayed another six hours if the showed the next two installments of this flick.  That was the only bad part of the film is the abrupt ending, but I still give this movie a 10, because it is a trilogy and I was expecting it.  If you want to see a great movie, one that delivers where so many have promised, but failed to deliever then this is the film to see...even if you didn't read the book.  And for anyone who has read the book I would love to hear your take on the movie, just don't give anything away about the next two parts.","

"filipemanuelneto","28 March 2016","Based on the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien and directed by Peter Jackson, this is the first film in the trilogy ""The Lord of the Rings,"" one of the most striking and most profitable in recent cinema. The film is set in an imaginary world, Middle Earth, where humans coexist with fantastic creatures such as elves, dwarfs, orcs's hobbit's etc. In this film, the balance of this illusory world is at stake because of the war against the evil lord Sauron, who eagerly wants to dominate, corrupt and submit all forms of life. In the midst of these events, two hobbit's living in the Shire, a little-known part of Middle Earth, have the difficult task of hiding the weapon that can decide the course of the war: a ring that gives power to Sauron and he desperately seeks to recover.Everything in this film, a contemporary epic, is perfect: the stunning scenery in New Zealand are breathtaking, the costumes were meticulously designed, the characterization is the top current range in film and computerized animations have been widely used to obtain scenes truly spectacular. The cast, in turn, is luxurious: in this film we have Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd (respectively, in the roles of the four hobbit's Frodo, Sam, Merrin and Pippin), Christopher Lee (as Saruman the magician), Sir Ian McKellen (as the Galdalf wizard the Grey), Cate Blanchett (as Lady Galadriel), Viggo Mortensen (as the walker Aragorn), Orlando Bloom (as the elven archer Legolas) and John Rhys-Davies ( as the dwarf warrior Gimli) and other very talented actors who gave the best of themselves to honor the audience with a movie luxuriously well done.It's not by chance that this movie, as well as the rest of the trilogy, had the impact it had. This is one of the most popular and profitable films of the century, maybe one of the best movies ever, marking the opening of the public to a new generation of epic films. There is only one mandatory film for any movie buff but one of the movies that few people could not see.","

"jaesboxer","26 June 2002","For the thousands of fans who thought it couldn't be done, to the skeptics and the critics who observed Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Lord Of The Rings into a trilogy would be the next Ishtar, a disaster of epic proportions, allay your fears.  The Lord Of The Rings:  The Fellowship Of The Ring is the most daring cinematic event to take place in years, and despite the fact it undeservedly lost the best picture oscar to A Beautiful Mind, it is, I strongly believe, a film for the ages.  NOt since Gone With THe Wind has an epic tale, critically acclaimed, been adapted into a film which is astounding in its own right.  The sets are marvelous, the characters portrayed to perfection (Most notably Ian McKellen as Gandalf), and the mythology of Middle-Earth brought to vivid life, combining to make a film that is both spectacular in its grandeur and engaging in its characters.  This is a film I believe equal to Lawrence Of Arabia in its scope, and I am anxiously awaiting the sequel THe Two Towers being released this Christmas.","

"Scarlet13","17 February 2002","When I first saw the trailers for ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" I had never had any interest in reading the lengthy tome of a trilogy.  But seeing the possibility of the movie, I immediately went out and read the whole thing, insisted on receiving it for Christmas, and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie.  I thought it was a fabulous work of art.I thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea, as it helped those who had never read the story.  It also immediately involved me in the film; I felt I had an insider's advantage on the rest of the audience.  Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice; the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen.  Also, showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes.  The Shire was almost exactly as I'd pictured it.  Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done, extremely real.  Rivendell had a little bit of a European-tourist-trap look, but was beautiful all the same.  The entire backdrop of the movie (the mountains, Moria, Isengard) was perfect; it's amazing that ""Fellowship"" was filmed in one country.Now to the characters.  All I can say is, ""Wow.""  I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first; I'd created such real images of the characters in my imagination, I almost didn't want them spoiled for me. However, I was not disapointed in the least.  Elijah Wood, though not one of my favorite actors, was believable.  You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood's pale, sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy, robust look of the rest of the hobbits.  He also cries like a little girl.  But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character.  The rest of the Hobbiton gang was well-chosen, too.  Sean Astin (""Rudy"" forever to me) was loyal and a bit bumbling, just like the Gamgee of Tolkien's telling.  Pippin and Merry were congenial, slow-witted lads, but very brave nonetheless.  Viggo Mortensen is outstanding.  He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility; the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting.  Some may have complained about Arwen's character being slightly expanded; I thought it a good change.  In the books, you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in ""The Return of the King"" to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen.  Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking, but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are.  Speaking of Elves, I can't help but gush over the handsome and ever-so-talented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas.  Bloom captured the archer's very movements; he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas's bowmanship was amazing; he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine-gun style.  He was my favorite character in the books, and his essence transcends the film.  Gimli was pompous and brave, as well.  He is well-represented in the movie.  Boromir was hopelessly lost, but at the same time valiant and strong.  Sean Bean gave an emotionally-charged performance as the tortured warrior.  Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond.  He was noble and cold at the same time.  And Gandalf.  What more can be said of Ian McKellan's showcase portrayal of the wizard?  He was magnificent.  He could be Gandalf, the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbit-children.  Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard, facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will.  His Oscar nomination is well-deserved.Peter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places.  Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch, he serves up raw emotion, graphic battles of good and evil, chilling and wonderful characters, and enough special effects (realistic, mind you) to make John Cameron's mouth water.  Knowing that ""The Two Towers"" was my favorite of the books, I eagerly anticipate the second helping of ""The Lord of the Rings.""","

"jwvandegronden-1","7 February 2022","I watched the extended version of a meager 3.5 hours. Having seen snippets of the movie when it came out on DVD and friends were watching it, I couldn't be bothered. I had read so many fantasy books over the years, and generally I tended to be disappointed by any novel that was made into a movie, for instance most of the adapted masterpieces written by Stephen King are mediocre at best; Only later I was able to enjoy adaptations, first one that comes to mind is Birdy with Nicholas Cage.Back to Fantasy, I had given Tolkien a try when I was too young, collapsing under its' volume. Later I reread it and loved it, so given the effort I put into it, I didnt wat it to be tainted by a sub par undertaking. And yes the raving reviews were pretty much in my face, but when time goes on, well, you know... That.So now, in 2022 I took the time to watch it, be it in parts as I don't have 3.5 hours to spare anymore unfortunately, and it was overwhelmingly beautiful! It is so long and there is so much to tell, that it borders on tedious at times, but the investment is so big you have to finish, you can't let it go! And the payoff is massive, and I have to say the most human among the fellowship, the human played by Sean Bean, brought tears to my eyes. I even had to gasp for air, what a performance! Amazingly well done.Over 20 years later, and the movie is still rock solid, nothing waned, not the visual effects, not the vision of all the different worlds, nothing looks out of whack, but spot on and suspending disbelief is not a thing at all, throughout the entire length of the movie. You are there, with them.I have to tip my hat to Peter Jackson, and curse him at the same time. If the other two parts are as well done, I'm afraid I will have a massive sleep deprivation issue once done.","

"ronakkotian","29 July 2020","The Lord of the Rings trilogy is prpbably the best trilogy to ever exist. Every film is absolutely perfect and it all started with The Fellowship of the Ring.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring follows a Hobbit and eight companions who go on an adventure to destroy the powerful One Ring and ultimately defeat Sauron.The Fellowship of the Ring sets the LOTR trilogy to a terrific start. This is one of the films I wish I saw in theatres as the large scale of it make it a cinematic experience. Peter Jackson directs this film with all his might. Absolutely stunning camerawork enhance J.R.R. Tolkien's magnificent creation of Middle-earth and fully immerses the audience into that world. Seeing the Fellowship as they come over the mountain with Howard Shore's epic score playing over it just made me leap with joy. This film is three hours long but it never feels like that. The grand size of this world along with its characters and story keeps you engaged till the end. That shows how good the editing and pacing is. There is not one single boring moment.If that wasn't enough, the performances are sure to win you over. Elijah Wood is perfect as Frodo. What is left to say about Ian McKellan as Gandalf. He's simply iconic. Viggo Mortenson is legendary, Sean Astin and Sean Bean are fantastic. The entire ensemble cast is simply outstanding.The Fellowship of the Ring concludes the first chapter of the trilogy in a very satisfying way. The characters, the visuals, Howard Shore's epic score, the performances and Peter Jackson's tremendous direction make this a cinematic masterpiece.","

"Kakueke","17 February 2002","The storyline in the ""Lord of the Rings"" is well constructed and interesting, the film is well-paced (you never get bored tho it is long), and the action scenes are well done.  But most of all, it is a dazzling visual marvel.Whether outdoors--scenes of forests and trees, valleys, streams, mountains--or in caves and the like, the visuals are superb.  Color, design, intricacy, detail, contrasts.  The backdrops are excellent.  There are battles with monsters and things like that, but the special effects are not overdone or pompous--they work very well.  A key for me here was not too much sped up action to create excess and pomposity and to have a hard time following what is going on, like in sci fi space battles or the Mummy movies or flicks like that.  Indeed, not only the pace of the plot, but the action, has economy.  In the outdoors, the backdrops are very pretty but for the most part realistic, but in the caves things are done up, with somewhat exaggerated or surreal colors, designs, effects.However, there are other movies with good visuals, even tho it is difficult to think of ones that outdo this.  But what sticks out most, in my mind? Not specifically the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but the LIGHTING.  Yes, that overlaps with the other things--backdrop, colors, etc., but it is particularly this item and the obvious sophistication and care that went into it, and the resulting artistic brilliance and beauty, that make the visuals, the cinematography, so excellent in my mind.  Whether indoors or outdoors, the lighting effects, the beauty, blending, and contrasts, are the highlight of the film.10 out of 10.","

"MaxBorg89","11 December 2005","I've always loved fantasy and science-fiction novels, and I'm very grateful for that, since the movie adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the reasons I fell in love with movies (the other reasons are Spider-Man, Casablanca, The Godfather and Pulp Fiction), it's so incredibly excellent. Some people refer to the Lord of the Rings trilogy as my generation's Star Wars (I was 12 when TFOTR was released), but I actually think it's better than Star Wars, and basically for one reason: the way director Peter Jackson has brought Tolkien's beloved classic to the screen.Jackson has perfectly understood CGI is nothing but a tool that enables the filmmaker to tell stories more easily: while in Star Wars we see dozens of different worlds, which are visually stunning but appear for only a couple of minutes (or seconds), in LOTR everything we see is there to make sure the story goes on. Oh, another important thing too: in this movie, plot and character come first, the visuals are added later. The director takes his time to introduce the various inhabitants of Middle Earth and the chain of events that will change their lives forever. The movie is almost three hours long, so what? It's a story we really care about, and the characters make us feel for them every single moment: we cheer with Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) when he learns he won't have to face his difficult task alone; we laugh with them when Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) make fools of themselves; we cry and worry with them when things start getting bad...That's probably also the reason for which this movie is superior to its sequels (N.B. I'm talking about the so-called ""theatrical versions""): in parts 2 and 3, important moments of character development are ditched in favor of long, breathtaking battles, and the audience knows something's missing. That's not the case of The Fellowship of the Ring: the extended version is better, that's true, but the first movie is the one with the least deleted minutes, and therefore the one that feels less incomplete than the others.As I said before, Jackson values characters more than effects, and he uses the latter only to tell the story more successfully, so that the world where those people live will look more realistic on screen; now, since the characters are more important, the cast is a crucial element, and luckily the actors chosen for this movie are pure perfection: Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dom Monaghan and Billy Boyd are career-best as the four hobbits, the most vulnerable members of the Fellowship, therefore the ones we care about the most; Viggo Mortensen is 100% convincing as the conflicted, layered Aragorn; Ian McKellen gives Gandalf the Grey the warmth and wisdom he deserves, and finally, Christopher Lee is just THE only actor who could flawlessly play the Darth Vader-like good-turned-bad Saruman, proving once again he's the N°1 choice when it comes to casting someone as the really bad guy. Like Dracula, he has gloriously resurrected to spread horror another time.An amazing beginning for an even more amazing trilogy, perhaps the best I've ever had the pleasure to see. Should have won Best Picture of 2001 (as well as Director and Adapted Screenplay).One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them... well, you know the rest!","

"Nachtritter","30 January 2002","...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read ""The Lord of the Rings"" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Silmarillion"" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in ""The Hobbit"" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron. Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried ""ranger"". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.","

For months I wanted to see this because of several reasons but the biggest one of them was Christopher Lee! I knew he was going to be awesome in this movie which he was.This cast was great and it was a treat seeing Ian Holm in it aswell.I knew LOTR was going to be one of the greatest movies ever and I just love the scenery in this movie and the special effects were flawless and it has great music by Howard Shore. There was so much in the three hour movie that I can`t explain it all but I will say it has great battles and sword fights,and seeing the variety of character is neat like wizards,trolls,dwarfs,hobbits,elvs,and among other creatures and a awesome prolouge.This in MY opinion ranks up in the greatest of films and this is on MY favorites list now just not fantasy movies like Willow and Legend but other of MY favorites like other great films such The Mummy/The Mummy Returns,Planet of the Apes (2001),Jurassic Park trilogy,Star Wars (all four of them),Gladiator,Terminator 2,Predator,and others.I just can`t wait for the sequels to come.Be sure to get all of the LOTR action figures by Toy Biz and they look great!

"bowmanblue","8 January 2020","The word 'epic' probable gets used too much these days to describe films. However, in this case it's definitely right. For those two people out there who don't know, 'The Lord of the Rings' is (primarily, excluding various 'spin-off' books) a trilogy of long books set in a fiction world called 'Middle Earth' which is filled with everything from wizards to dragons (yes, think 'Game of Thrones,' but with less nudity.It had long been considered that J. R. R. Tolkien's books were 'unfilmable' due to no screen adaptation being able to bring his lavish world to life (properly). There was an animated attempt (which wasn't as bad as people made out), but due to budgetary reasons, it was left unfinished (a concept which left me particularly confused when I watched it as a child). However, now the source material has finally been given the big screen treatment it deserved and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is the start of the trilogy's life in mainstream cinema.Despite the long backstory (shown in a brief montage/history lesson at the beginning of the film) all you need to know is that the spirit of a 'dark lord' wants his magic ring back in order to become whole again and generally take over the land. However, by luck the piece of jewellery in question is in the hands of a gentle race of little creatures known as 'hobbits.' They, together with an assortment of men, wizards, dwarfs and elves, vow to prevent the dark lord Sauron from getting his property back and set off on a quest to destroy it in the fires of the volcano where it was once forged.I suppose you could call the cast an 'ensemble.' With a story that requires so many characters, quite a few familiar faces will pop up. Primarily you have Sir Ian McKellen as the iconic wizard, Gandalf the Grey, but he's backed up by everyone from Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee to Sean Bean and Viggo Mortensen. In fact it's more a case of the more 'famous' Hollywood actors are secondary to the two hobbits who are at the centre of the tale, Frodo and Sam, plays by Elijah Wood and Sean Aston respectively. They're possibly less well-known that the affore-mentioned actors and yet rise to the challenge and prove that they're more than capable of having a major cinematic franchise rest on their (miniature!) shoulders.The cast is perfectly surrounded by some of the best sets, scenery and special effects ever to be committed to the big screen at the time (yes, you can - sort of - see a bit of 'green screen' work these days, but they still hold up!). Some say that the whole trilogy is one giant advert for the New Zealand tourist board, as it makes use of all the country's different landscapes to great effect.Of course seeing as 'Fellowship' is the first in a trilogy, there a certain amount of 'set up' contained where some story threads are mentioned but never expanded on - yet. However, this never really stops anyone from understanding what's going on and I'm sure once you watch this installment you'll want to know where it all goes!I know that the real 'Tolkien purists' will argue about which bits from the book have either been left out, or slightly changed, like making an Elf maiden an outright warrior in the film. I've read the books and, due to their length, it would probably be impossible to commit every last page to screen (unless you make every film about six hours!) and what they've done is taken all the most important points and used them to great effect to make the story as accessible to as many people as possible.I think it was writer/director Kevin Smith who said in 'Clerks II' that the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy was just basically 'people walking.' Okay, so funny as that may be (and - technically - true) there's so much more to the film that just that. The best part about 'Fellowship' (and indeed the whole trilogy) is that it can be enjoyed by most people, not just fans of the book or the genre, but also appreciated by (nearly) everyone with an eye for good cinema due to its achievements in world-building and sheer scale.","

"zkonedog","10 March 2017","Adapting a novel for the big screen is never easy, as the printed-word format is often quite expansive and not easily pared down to suit the necessities of the big screen. Now, try that transition with perhaps the most well-known fantasy novel of all-time. That was the task director Peter Jackson faced while creating ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Not only does he succeed, but he does so on perhaps the highest possible level. ""Fellowship"" is truly one of the greatest book-to-film transitions ever attempted.For a very basic overview, this films establishes the legacy of the One Ring of Power and the fellowship put together to protect/destroy it. The ring, initially possessed by Hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), is passed down to nephew Frodo (Elijah Wood) who begins his trek to destroy it by casting it into the fires of Mount Doom from whence it was created. Joining Frodo on his journey are...-Gandalf the Grey Wizard (Ian McKellen)
-Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom)
-Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies)
-Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) & Bolomir (Sean Bean) of the Realm of Men
-Fellow Hobbits Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), & Pippin (Billy Boyd)The scale of this endeavor--even just this first installment--is perhaps unmatched in the entirety of cinema. Unlike some high-aiming adaptations that might pull punches or cut corners, this is an ""all-in"" effort from the get-go. From costuming to music, location, acting, and special effects, you'll hardly feel like you're watching a movie. Instead, you will essentially be living within it. That is how expertly Jackson captures the realms of Middle Earth.Obviously, J.R.R. Tolkien (original writer of the novel trilogy) crafted a story in LOTR that will be passed down through the generations. But Jackson accomplishes just as monumental a feat. While cutting and trimming here and there to make the long tomes work in a cinematic setting, there is very little lost in the change-over. The books I was utterly captivated by as an adolescent are--rather improbably--equaled here.As such, I consider ""Fellowship"" an extraordinary film to kick off the LOTR trilogy on the big screen. In hindsight, if the trilogy can be evaluated as standalone efforts, it is probably the best of the bunch. As the closing credits roll and the promise of further adventure beckons, you are almost guaranteed to feel two things: an intense desire to dive into ""The Two Towers"", and the overwhelming knowledge that an incredible book has been miraculously transformed into a never-to-be-outdone film.","

"nickenchuggets","30 August 2022","The sheer feeling of excitement I got while watching this movie was something I thought I would never get a chance to experience. Not really being an avid reader of Tolkien's works, I feel that (and this might seem like heresy to some people) watching this not only allows you to understand the huge Lord of the Rings universe more clearly, but also see it in all its stunning imagery and scenery. After all, this wasn't possible until this movie came out. There are so many incredible things about this movie that I don't even know where to start, and because it's still so recent, I was surprised by (but still aware of the fact) that it's often said to be one of the best films ever. Like always, I'll start by explaining the storyline, which perfectly sets up and establishes a vibrant fantasy world like no other. Fellowship of the Ring starts by telling us that in Middle-earth's second age, the lords ruling over the races of humans, dwarves, and elves have special rings given to them. They are all incredibly powerful, but the dark lord Sauron forges a ring of his own in his evil kingdom of Mordor. This ring (known as the One Ring), has a large portion of his own malevolent energy sealed into it. Sauron wants to eventually take all the other rings for himself and invade middle-earth. Eventually, a huge army of men and elves fight Sauron's army in Mordor, and he is defeated by a warrior named Isildur. Isildur has the opportunity to throw the One Ring into the flames of Mount Doom, which is the only place that can destroy it, but chooses not to. Although Sauron is defeated (for now), his ring still has a huge amount of power. It is lost at the bottom of a river for 25 centuries until a creature named Smeagol locates it. It corrupts him and turns him into monster. One day, Smeagol loses it and it's found by a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who has no idea of the tragic history of the item he now possesses. 6 decades have passed since Bilbo has found the ring. On his 111th birthday, he is visited by his old wizard friend, Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen). Gandalf tries to convince Bilbo to give up the ring because of its evil history, so he leaves on a quest and allows his nephew Frodo (Elijah Wood) to have access to all his belongs (including the ring). Meanwhile, Gandalf finds out that Smeagol was captured by Sauron's forces and tortured until he revealed the ring's location. He only told them that Bilbo had it, and that he lived in The Shire, but this was enough. Faceless horse riders dressed in black cloaks, known as Ringwraiths, scour Bilbo's neighborhood looking for the ring, so Gandalf and Frodo both leave. Gandalf travels to the fortress of Isengard to meet with the wise wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) to discuss what to do next, but the latter is actually allied with Sauron and traps Gandolf inside the structure. Frodo soldiers on. He takes some of his friends, Sam, Pippin and Merry, and arrives at a village called Bree. They're supposed to meet Gandalf here, but because he's been taken prisoner, he never shows up. After journeying a bit more with the assistance of a new ally named Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the group are ambushed by Ringwraiths and Frodo is stabbed with one of their weapons, which has the power to turn him into one after a few hours. Aragorn's elf girlfriend, named Arwen, saves Frodo while being chased by ringwraiths, and gets rid of them by inducing a flood with her magic. Frodo is eventually healed, and Gandalf has managed to escape Saruman's clutches using a giant bird. While everyone sits around trying to decide what to do next, the newly established Fellowship of the Ring intends to destroy the ring by taking it to Mordor. On the way there, they try to scale a snowy mountain, but Saruman is aware of their efforts and tries to cause an avalanche. Frodo decides it's too dangerous and tells everyone they need to travel through the Mines of Moria instead, which isn't much better. While there, they fight numerous Orcs, a savage and warlike race who were once elves, as well as a huge troll. Sadly, Gandalf is apparently killed when he fends off an enormous demon called a Balrog so the others can escape unharmed. Finally, the group arrives at Lothlorien, an elf realm ruled by the queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). Here, Frodo learns from a vision that only he can take the ring to Mordor and destroy it. In one last attempt to take the ring back, Saruman raises an enormous orc army and sends it to the Kingdom of Gondor. Two warriors assigned to protect Frodo, Boromir and Legolas (Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom respectively) try their best to fend off the relentless stream of orcs, but Baromir is killed. Frodo and Sam then travel down a mountain pass. With Mordor in sight, Frodo knows what he must do. The quality of this movie blows my mind. Normally I'm reluctant to give movies made past the 1970s perfect scores, because to be honest few of them deserve it. With this one, it makes me realize that maybe watching a recent movie now and then is a good idea. There's so many reasons to praise this movie that I can do it all day long, but for me, it's three things: the incredibly rich and detailed environments, the compelling characters, and the engrossing story. I'm sure it's a well known fact that Lord of the Rings as a whole served to inspire countless other fantasy movies, books, and even video games, and it's not hard to imagine why. Tolkien's universe is ridiculously big, and contains a large number of kingdoms, realms, and countless other locations, each with their own unique backstories and histories. It doesn't take anything less than a masterpiece of a book to inspire a film of this caliber. The landscapes in this movie are just something to behold, and it's my firm belief that basically every single frame of it belongs in a museum. All the environments look different, but they're all incredibly dreamlike and captivating to stare at. I can do it for hours. The characters are the meat of the story, and LOTR doesn't disappoint in any way. Although Sauron doesn't appear much physically, you can feel his presence throughout the film because the ring has his life essence in it, and wants to find its way back to him. Throughout the entire movie, Frodo is carrying with him immense amounts of evil. I think we can all agree that Gandalf is one of the greatest characters in fictional history anyway, whether you're a fan of this series or not. The special effects too are definitely worthy of such a monumental series. Even 20 years later, they look amazing and just as real as the actors themselves, which can't be said for a lot of other modern films. There's so much more to the movie though that I've barely touched the surface. It's not like no one knows this, since Tolkien's books have been considered classics for decades for good reason. It just amazes me that Peter Jackson was able to create such a worthy adaptation of a book people have loved for years. The most mindblowing thing is that there's more than one, but that's a story for another time.","

"Movie-ManDan","8 February 2015","Star Wars, The Godfather, and Indiana Jones are the best trilogies ever. Among them are the three adaptations of JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth epics: The Lord of the Rings. What makes this trilogy superior to the other three I mentioned is that they feature an instalment that is considerably inferior to the others. Return of the Jedi is the worst Star Wars, Godfather III is the worst Godfather and Temple of Doom is the worst Indiana Jones. I would have to call Fellowship the worst Lord of the Rings movie, but it is not considerably inferior to its sequels.Australian director Peter Jackson brings the timeless sequel to The Hobbit to life. In Middle Earth, Rings were made to different races that gave power. One Ring ruled them all, owned by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron lost the ring in battle and is stubbled upon by a hobbit named Smeagal (Serkis). He goes crazy as the Ring consumes him and becomes a little creature known as Gollum. The Ring leaves him and is found by another hobbit named Bilbo Baggins (Holm). When Bilbo leaves, the Ring is no longer left with an owner, so Sauron and his ugly band of Orcs are reawaken and seek the Ring. After wizard, Gandalf (McKellen) discovers the Ring's unspeakable powers, Bilbo's young nephew, Frodo (Wood) becomes the carrier and is joined by a group of warriors to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring.Lord of the Rings is a true masterpiece. I found each sequel better than the last. But there are some people that are not fans of any of them. Famous film critic and award winning journalist, Richard Roeper, gave this movie thumbs down when he and Roger Ebert reviewed it. he later changed his mind after seeing the other movies, but still. And I know of people that don't like these movies because they found the whole fantasy subject to be too cheesy and unrealistic. Well, that's what a fantasy movie is: unrealistic. People that don't like these movies are completely ignorant to movies and storytelling. The whole premise of these movies are long and complex that need lots of explaining. Most people generally don't understand the story, which is why my summary is long. It may follow the general monomyth archetype, but it is full of subplots and backstories that make the plot more complex and original than other monomyth archetypes. But what people love to praise is the general filming. People that don't like the LOTR movies fail to understand how difficult and masterful the movies were made. Take any five minutes of this, and think about how much work was put into it. All the make-up, costumes, set pieces, choreography, etc, etc. That is why these movies are such joys to see and why you can't take your eyes off of them. I honestly don't think there has been any movies since that have been harder to make than this. If so, they're not that much harder.Peter Jackson recently finish his trilogy of The Hobbit. The Hobbit is one novel that's a prequel to LOTR. Jackson made three epics of one 400 paged story. I don't think he should have done so. The Hobbit movies are not at the level of the LOTR movies. If you ask me, Jackson should have done two Hobbit movies in 1998 and 1999, then do the LOTR as is. He would have ended on a better note then.4/4","

"happiscotsman","16 July 2002","Roger Ebert only gave this film three stars because he felt it did not meet his personal criteria for what the movie should be like. But that is what Peter Jackson has been embellishing ever since he started on this nearly eight-year odyssey. It is Jackson's view of how HE would want the movie to be made. On that note, this film has been worth the three years I have spent salivating over any and every web site designed to proclaim the greatest film series ever (""Star Wars"" has lost its edge, and ""The Matrix"" has too narrow an appeal). The only reason I found out these movies were being made was because I was curious what Sean Bean had been up to. This was in 1998, and the wait was well worth it. New Zealand was the PERFECT place for filming Middle Earth, and Jackson does a fine job in making sense of the epic novel. The actors were all fine in their roles, although I still long for Sean Connery as Gandalf, even though Sir Ian McKellen did get an Academy Award nomination. Personally, I though the best performances were by Sean Astin and Sean Bean (Have I already shown my bias for the only man who could play Richard Sharpe?) And while the action scenes are quite engaging, the Rivendell scene stands out as my favorite. The first shots capture the mystery and splendor of Middle Earth's most enchanting and enigmatic characters, the Eldar (Elves to you non-readers of the novels). Howard Shore's Oscar-winning score is no better the here, with the ghostly chorus holding their notes as the Hobbits stroll mesmerized through this strange and beautiful land. The imagery is so engaging that the audience cannot help but be swept away as well. This is what movie-making is all about folks, and if you miss this, you've missed a lot.","

"Yrneh","22 December 2001","I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of `The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the `The Lord of the Rings'"" as he himself put it.  After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: ""Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings' itself?"".  In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with.  In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema.  The book itself is `HUGE': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three).I have just seen the first `volume' and can say without hesitation that he has succeeded in both his goals.  It is not the book but a reading of the book which is inventive and fascinating.  It is the kind of experience that makes you want to go back and reread the whole thing in the light of the emphases that Jackson has brought to the story.  He focuses on the corrupting influence of the ring and, through this focus, the character of the chief protagonists of the story are revealed.  Clearly those most tempted by it are mortal men (Boromir and even, in one moment, Aragorn), those who already have power (Elrond - `The ring cannot stay here'; Galadriel; Gandalf and Saruman),  and, of course, those who would not normally desire it but who by accident become ring bearers - Gollum, Bilbo, Frodo.  I can see why, in this reading, Jackson decided to leave out the Bombadil episode.  Bombadil, like the Balrog, is beyond the ring but the latter is important to the unfolding of the story of the fates of all the characters, Bombadil isn't.It is a miracle of this reading of the first volume of the book that one can see where Jackson is going and one can get a feel of how the reading is going to unfold.  In a sense, Jackson's real trial - as far as those who know the books are concerned - will come with the second film in the series. He has lived up to our expectation by creating even bigger ones: how can he handle the story of the chase andrescue of Merry and Pippin, the storming of Isengard etc - stories which don't really add much to the core theme that is emerging.  Or is he now going to add the theme of the great contest of good versus evil to the unfolding reading?All of this points to the fact that the film, even though it is a feast of special effects, focuses on character.  And this also explains why Jackson chose the actors he did for their roles: they are not `big' names - no `Sean Connery', no `Alan Rickman', no `Brad Pitt', no `Sam Neill'etc.  He didn't want them getting in the way of the story of character.  Ian McKellan's talents, in particular, are used to tell a large proportion of the story: an enormous amount is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and even by the language of his body. The other miracle in all of this is Elijah Wood.  Like many others, when I first heard of Jackson's choice, I groaned: but Wood has been extraordinary.  He brings, as one friend said, a strange kind of androgyny to the role and this is just perfect. McKellan has already been knighted: give Wood the Oscar.And then there is Middle Earth: this is, as someone put it, another character in the story and the New Zealand landscape, digitally enhanced on occasion, lives up to its role too.Enough.  See this film!  Greatest film ever made?  How can one make a claim like that! Silly really; as silly as claiming that `The Lord of the Rings' is the greatest book ever written.  Can't one simply love a story, enjoy reading it a number of times amd lose oneself in it.  One CAN claim that it is the greatest work in its genre as is the film.10/10","

"alindsayal","12 December 2021","So with the Lockdown back in effect I thought it was time to get started on re watching The Lord Of The Rings and Hobbit Films so yesterday I watched The Fellowship Of The Ring and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of companions from different races have to come together to travel to a dark land to destroy a powerful ring and stop the dark lord Sauron.Main Character
Elijah Wood plays Frodo Baggins a Hobbit who is tasked with carrying the ring and he is great here. You really get the feeling that Frodo is out of his depth on the quest but Wood does a good job in making him likeable and you really want to see him succeed in his quest. Viggo Mortenson plays Aragorn and he is brilliant here, he is such a physical actor here and he nails all the action scenes that he is given. He is also a really interesting character, I mean you are given bits and pieces in this film to keep you interested, but not giving you too much right off the bat.Supporting Characters
There are so many characters in this film and everybody is great but I will only talk about a few of them in greater detail. Sir Ian McKellen plays Gandalf The Grey and he is awesome here, Gandalf is so wise and McKellen nails it as the wise, fun and action heavy wizard that is a real mentor figure to the rest of The Fellowship and does it effectively. Sean Bean plays Boromir and he is also a really interesting character here, he has a bit of a darker personality then the other characters but he gives a very memorable performance. Sir Christopher Lee plays Saruman The White and of course he is fantastic, he is a legend and a hue Lord Of The Rings fan so of course he is great in the role, Saruman is another really interesting cog of the film and his dynamic with Gandalf is fascinating to watch. As I said everybody is great, Orlando Bloom is great, Cate Blanchett is great, Sean Astin is great and the whole group is just so great and one of the greatest ensembles of all time.Story
The story is great, it brings you into this world as we follow these people come together on this epic quest. The characters and their connection together is what drives the film forward and you will end up caring about all of them throughout, it has a simple good vs evil but layers it with so much depth to make this a great journey. The film may be 3 hours long but the story stays interesting throughout and moves at a really nice pace to keep you intrigued for every minute of the film.Script
The script is great, it takes this fantastical world and gives us interesting and down to earth characters that we can look up to and care about. This is obviously a very dramatic film and it nails all of that but it is the humour too that makes this script legendary. You can go from drama to humour and it feels really natural and helps build the world and the characters up.Style
The style of the film is amazing, the landscapes of New Zealand where it was filmed it as beautiful as ever which is advanced by some legendary cinematography mixed with Howard Shore's epic score that just brings you into Middle Earth. Even though the film is 3 hours long it is paced perfectly and as I mentioned before keeps you invested throughout with some great action scenes.Overall
Overall, The Fellowship Of The Ring is one of the greatest films ever made, if you haven't seen this film then find not only 3 hours but nine hours to watch all of these films, heck maybe watch the extended editions but do it whenever you can as it is a must watch.Rating - 10/10.","

"pyrocitor","3 April 2006","The Fellowship of the RingWhen one begins to write one's sentiments regarding a movie such as Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic Lord of the Rings trilogy, the main problem isn't having difficulty finding things to remark upon - the main problem is knowing where to begin. The Fellowship of the Ring essentially redefined the term ""quality"", in its extraordinary ability to vastly succeed the already unreasonably high expectations of audiences and die-hard fans of the novels everywhere. It becomes difficult to avoid bias by painting the film with outlandish and likely unreasonable praises, but I must confess I could go on for literally pages pointing out how blown away I still am by virtually every aspect of this movie, the first, and in my opinion, strongest as a film of the trilogy. So I'll try to keep it concise - Jackson has truly brought the novels to life in a fashion one could never have imaged short of actually seeing it for themselves. The sets and appearance of Middle Earth are among the greatest ever created, an impeccable blend of CGI, constructed sets, and the already breathtaking landscapes of beautiful New Zealand. The beautiful cinematography brings this all to light again, in the best sense of the word - seldom does a movie look so, simply put, beautiful. The costumes and appearances of the various creatures and inhabitants of Middle Earth are once again, mind-blowing - some of the best and most convincing computer generated images are on display in these movies. This is all punctuated by Howard Shore's simply gorgeous and incredibly moving Oscar winning score.Acting is also simply nothing less than astounding, with every cast member not only seeming torn straight out of the pages of the novels, born to play their role, but also turning out pretty much flawless performances around the board. There are standouts of course, especially Sir Ian McKellan's now career defining turn as the warm yet incredibly wise and powerful wizard Gandalf, Viggo Mortenson's wonderful flawed yet noble hero Aragorn, Sean Bean's excellent and truly touching portrayal of the quintessential flawed male character Boromir, Elijah Wood as the good hearted lead character, the innocent hobbit Frodo Baggins, and Sean Aston as his faithful and loyal companion Samwise, and Christopher Lee as the corrupted and now evil wizard Saruman the White. Cate Blanchett is a huge scene-stealer, as the regal (and briefly chilling) elf queen Galadriel, while John Rhys-Davies is perfectly gruff and hilarious as cantankerous dwarf Gimli, and Liv Tyler is breathtakingly elegant as Arwen (and thankfully given more to do than simply stand around pining, as in the next two films). Then there is of course the absurdly underrated Andy Serkis' mind blowing portrayal of the creature Gollum. Though mainly seen in the next two films, Serkis already manages to make a powerful first impression with his 2 minutes or less of screen time. Again, it seems entirely fair to say the Lord of the Rings movies are among the greatest movies ever made, for their incredibly detailed attention to the details of Tolkien's novels, and their still surprising ability to exceed expectations in every possible way in film-making and storytelling terms. This is epic storytelling at its best - if you are among the very few who have yet to see these movies, strongly consider doing so - it will be well worth your while.-10/10","

"TheLittleSongbird","19 October 2010","J.R.R Tolkein's books are wonderful, with memorable characters, an enchanting atmosphere, strong narrative and dialogue and an epic story. Peter Jackson's trilogy mayn't be necessarily true to them, but it does have the memorable characters, the epic story and enchanting atmosphere that the books do. The Fellowship of the Ring is probably the weakest of the three, but it is a very solid start. It is I agree slower in pace to the other two, and there are some talky scenes that drag it down a tad.However, I cannot deny that this is a great film. One of the many strong assets of this picture are the visuals. The cinematography is marvellous, the costumes are splendid, the effects are great, the makeup is immaculate and the scenery is fantastic especially with Rivendell which was like a Utopia. There is also the score, what an amazing score. As much as I do like Howard Shore, his scoring for the Lord of The Rings trilogy is his most memorable for me and probably his most complex as well. There are so many beautiful and haunting parts here, sometimes even at the same time, as well as the charming Hobbits theme, the ethereal theme played while at Rivendell and the sinister bombastic sounds while at Mordor.Now I am not going to say that Peter Jackson is a bad director or an outstanding director, but he has directed some wonderful films especially Heavenly Creatures, and this is no exception, where he does a very capable job directing. The story still has its epic scope, with standouts being the confrontation between Gandalf and Sarouman, the scene in the mines with Balrok and Boromir's death scene. I also liked the pursuit of Frodo and Arwyn and Frodo with the Black Riders which was beautifully shot. Then there is the dialogue, which on the whole is excellent, Gandalf in my personal opinion gets the best of it.And the acting is very good. I do think Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, but Elijah Wood does do a likable enough job here, while Sean Astin's bumbling yet well meaning persona suits Sam well. Cate Blanchett is a lovely Galadriel, and Liv Tyler is stunning as Arwyn. And then there is Christopher Lee, whose presence always ensures that the performance is going to be good, and indeed it was, and Ian Holm is very good as Bilbo. Sean Bean also does well with Boromir, and John Rhys Davies is a welcome presence. Aragorn like Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, here he is more brooding and charismatic above all else. Not a bad thing really, as Viggo Mortenssen does do that very well. The standout though is Ian McKellen, who is an absolute revelation as Gandalf, the delivery to the camera, the delivery of the lines, perfectly judged. In fact the only real weak link in the cast is Orlando Bloom, yes he is dashing and handsome, but in the process he does come across as a little uncharismatic and bland.In conclusion, a great start. 9/10 Bethany Cox","

"karenlynn1","31 March 2006","I must say I was skeptical when I first heard my favorite novels were being made into films. I dreaded A-list tow headed actors and actresses over-dramatizing and/or faking their way through one of the greatest journeys ever. I feared they'd cast Tom Cruise as Aragorn, and Brad Pitt or some other overindulgent, overconfident ""golden boy"" as Legolas--a character I've loved since I first read the chapter about The Council of Elrond. ...but then I heard That Elijah Wood, a fine young child actor now grown up, was playing Frodo. I was intrigued. Sir Ian McKellen would be playing Gandalf--and I felt it would be refreshing to see him play such a good, likable character after watching him play Magnetto in X-Men (another performance of his I enjoyed.) The rest of the cast was either unknown to me at the time, or I hadn't heard that they had been cast in it yet. Needless to say I was DYING to see this movie. Unfortunately I didn't get to see the film when it first came out. In fact, I finally got to see it several months later. Definitely worth the wait. The cast, the script, the entire production was simply flawless.Within the first scene the shire that I read about when I was a child, came to life... Middle earth where I longed to escape as a child had come to life, and was even more beautiful than I imagined. THe characters were almost exactly how I had pictured them, and the excitement, the drama, and everything else seemed very, very real.My hat is off to Peter Jackson for his excellent job in bringing The Lord of the Rings to life, for those of us who grew up dreaming of Middle Earth. He did a wonderful job of (more or less) sticking to the original story, and bringing his vision of The Lord of The Rings to the big screen for all of us to enjoy. Hat's off to the cast too, who not only looks exactly like I imagined them...they act and speak, even walk just how I pictured them. Some long-time Tolkien readers may scoff at scenes that were cut out, or rearranged...or Arwen taking the place of Glorfindel in the Flight to the Ford... Well some scenes don't always translate well onto film,...I would have been bored watching Frodo wait a full ten years at Bagend waiting for Gandalf while the Sacksville Baggins' raided and pilfered what Bilbo had left behind... The Tom Bombadill scenes would have been rather bland, and taken away from the central story... And I didn't mind at all that Arwen was the one to save Frodo...that scene was so spectacular, F/X wise! I'm not going to nit pick about a female elf saving Frodo. Regardless of such changes, the movie is spectacular! If you don't like it...well then maybe fantasy movies, or classic literature brought to life is just not your thing. To each his own.But it's a must see for all Tolkien fans, all fantasy fans, and all who want to escape reality for approx 4 hours... and wander into Middle Earth.","

"Atticus_1588","29 July 2002","I have seen ""LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring"" twice in theatres. The first time I left I knew I had seen something great...but I needed to see it again. I went back about two weeks later and realized this film is brilliant. The story is extremely strong. A simple story told complex, and greatly. Although I have not read the books I plan on eventually doing so now that I have seen the film. The acting is also a very, very strong part of this film. Elijah Wood deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Frodo. He does such a great job. Also, Ian McKellen did a great job of Gandalf. The rest of the acting is great too. The directing is the best thing about this film along with the story. It takes you from place to place so well and vividly...it is amazing. Peter Jackson knew exactly what he wanted to when he walked into doing this film. He had an amazing vision. The music score is also another method of telling this story even stronger. It fits perfectly into any scene they are doing in the movie. If I have left anything out about this film I know why. There is so much I could tell you about this film and how much I love it but I will just point out those things. I cannot wait until ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"". It looks just as amazing as the first just from the previews. If you have not seen this, go see it NOW. In a theatre or when it arrives on DVD and VHS. 10.0/10.0 A classic","

"Skeletors_Hood","19 July 2002","I knew from the first time I saw the preview that this was a movie that I wanted to see. Now, I have never picked up a Tolkien book, and the only story I ever knew was the Hobbit, and that was from the animated movie. Now, let me make my observations of some of the reviews listed here, and I must say that everyone is entitled to an opinion, and here is mine.  If you don't like this movie, pronouncing it as boring and too long, then you obviously don't have the patience to watch a great movie, more like you love the hacked off 88 min movie that has no real script to speak of, and only took 2 months to film.  Which is fine, because I like those movies as well,but also I personally love a movie that took a lot of work, and is also very spectacular as a result.  Titanic comes to mind, for one.  I want substance in a movie, and LotR delivers.  It is a true work of art, unlike (someone mentioned ""Fight Club"" ???? A classic?! I think not).  If you only thought of it as boring, then you were only looking for action and no story, in which case the latest Van Damme movie would have fulfilled your expectations.What I truly loved about this movie wasn't just the scenery, but the acting as well.  Each part was brought to life perfectly, and the actors had great chemistry together.  I especially loved Ian as Gandalf, and I must also give a great nod to Christopher Lee, who has always made a great villain.  The action was well placed and suspenseful, and everything looked as I would expect a fantasy world to look like.  Overall a very well made movie.  If you hate it, then maybe it's over your head.","

"juliegi","22 March 2002","I think this is the best film of 2001. As an avid fan of the J.R.R. Tolkein novels, I was excited to see these being made into films. I was not disappointed by the movie which followed the books pretty faithfully without getting too long and drawn out. All of the acting was great and the special effects well-done. I cannot wait to see the 2nd and 3rd films.","

"NateW","2 July 2002","The long awaited live action adaption of the classic Tolkein novel Lord of the Rings more than justified the massive hype surrounding it. Simply put, it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I have not been so utterly blown away by a film in a long time like I was when I saw this. Every, and I mean every, aspect of this film is executed flawlessly. The ensemble performances are truly fantastic, especially by Wood and McKellan. All I can say is I can't wait for it to be released on DVD and I can't wait for The Two Towers and Return of the King to come to theatrical release. I think we have finally seen the arrival of a trilogy that matches the magnitude of the original Star Wars trilogy. 10/10","

"bombersflyup","16 November 2020","The Fellowship of the Ring is a tale of valiance and camaraderie, as well as an expedition in sight and sound.A cinematic experience, the extended version clocking at just under 4 hours. An enchanting and wondrous beginning in the shire. The Frodo, Gandalf and Sam exchanges, the peak of the film. Frodo need not take on this burden, but like John McClane said ""that's what makes you ""that guy."" An excellent cast, with many strong portrayals. Elijah Wood in particular, wonderful. This, the best part of the series in my opinion.","

"jbirtel","3 June 2002","First...A disclaimer! (and trivia; for those who care) Lord of the Rings is NOT a trilogy, despite popular perception. It ranks as one of the longest single novel that's been written and consists of 6 books:BOOK I  ""The First Journey"" and BOOK II ""The Journey of the Nine Companions"" comprise FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. BOOK III  ""The Treason of Isengard"" and BOOK IV ""The Journey of the Ringbearers"" are THE TWO TOWERS. BOOK V  ""The War of the Ring"" and BOOK VI ""The End of the Third Age"" concludes THE RETURN OF THE KING.(the titles were part of Tolkien's manuscript but were never used).That said, the upcoming TWO TOWERS & RETURN...are not sequels and shouldn't be viewed as such. So There !!!  Like Peter Jackson, I can't wait till the entire trilo...oops, I mean the entire story can be viewed back to back on DVD at 10 hours plus.Oh! the movie. It's great! On 1st viewing, there were more things I liked then didn't, but my perception was prejudiced from my own interpretation cemented thru many years (I read it 8 or 9 times over 20 years). But on repeated viewings, I came to appreciate the brilliance behind the maker's decisions on how to tackle the telling that would appeal to readers and non-readers alike (face it! there's no way to please EVERYBODY). Compromises were necessary; so it wasn't to the letter of the book. What was captured faithfully were the set-pieces, the characters (fleshed out beyond expectation) and the spirit of the excitement & thrills. This is what cinema should be.Those who liked the movie (readers and non) will appreciate a repeat viewing that is near improbable to catch the first time. SUBTLE SPOILER:(that's Gollum's voice screaming ""Shire"" then ""Baggins"", seconds later the Nine Riders exit the gates of  Barad-dur [the Dark Lord's tower]. Immediately what follows is Gandalf's approach toward Minas Tirith [nice long shot] that will be more prevalent as the city besieged in RETURN OF THE KING. And of course, readers will recognize Tom, Bert and Bill, the trolls from ""The Hobbit"". This is just a few bits of treasure laced thru-out the movie). (more subtle spoilers) I admired the slight changes made. I never did believe Frodo could've stayed on that horse by himself, in his condition, on his final flight from the Nine Riders (unless the horse sprouted an extra pair of hands to hold him) so Arwen's expanded role seemed totally justified. It also gave the filmaker's an opportunity to expand the role of women as heroes, that was sadly minimized in the trilo...darn-it!...I mean the epic (I almost take that back as the character ""Eowyn"" will prove in the upcoming sequ... I mean, installments of the story). Also, the Tom Bombadil episode was an amusing trifle...for the novel (I did like it), but I always wondered how anyone could film that section without producing unintentional laughter from the audience. It's ommission is ok by me, as the first part of the movie really belongs to the thrill of the chase and the terror of capture from the Nine.There are so many nice things said about the performances, the music, the locales, the props (wonderful) that's been said better then I can (most of all...Jackson and the collaborater's vision) so, no sense in repeating it here. It's not totally flawless...but realistically...what is?? As far as it's slight from the American Academy Awards as Best Picture...big deal! (It did win the British Award and American Film Inst. Award) No lack of any award robbed my enjoyment from Citizen Kane, Chinatown, Wizard of Oz (I equally loved the movies that did win_) and the lack of Best Picture won't take any pleasure away from Fellowship.. (please don't interpret that I'm lumping these movies on the same level - I'm just making a point - then again, maybe I am)For those who didn't enjoy it as much, that's understandable. No movie in history has been unanimous amoung critics, or viewers for that matter. I wasn't sure how much I enjoyed it the first time, but after many repeat viewings, I surrender!   10 out of 10","

"Prestige_Never_Pride","23 September 2008","I confess to say that I did not see the first two LOTR films in theaters. The fact of the matter was that my sister was 6 years old and scared easily, so my father wouldn't take her. So, my father went on his own to see them. I did, however get to see Return of the King in theaters. I was entranced. I was 12 years old at the time, and I didn't understand the story. But I was captivated. When Pippin sang his song, I was in tears. At the very end, I was sobbing. The sense of beauty it had...I couldn't even describe it. So, I watched the first two movies respectively with my father. And now I was within Middle-Earth. I read the books the same month that I saw all three films. Simultaneously, in fact. That is my admiration story.What can I say about this movie that won't fill a novel? Where do I start? I suppose with Peter Jackson. I was so struck to learn how these beautiful works of art, Tolkien's magnum opus, inspired him to want to take on such a daunting yet gratifying task. He saw more in those books than I had read from them, and I'm glad that a dedicated fan brought these jewels to screen. Thank you, Mr. Jackson! The cast? Absolutely beautiful. Their friendship is so apparent, so close, not faked as you see in many other movies. Not one actor in those three films were bad. Yes, you heard me. So those of you who said that the casting was terrible, let me say to you: ""Not all those who wander are lost.""Elijah Wood, who is a very gifted and bright young man, has such an incredible beauty (inside and out) to portray such a conflicted and fatalistic character. His own striking idealism, innocence, and understanding was such that you fell in love with Frodo at first sight, but not to the point where he seemed weak. Elijah is Frodo incarnate, and anyone else would have ruined the role.Sean Astin, another very bright young man, shows his warm wisdom as Samwise, as well as a courage the likes of which I have never seen before in any performance. He had such an aura of honesty and kindliness that it shone like a light on screen. His friendship with Frodo (Elijah respectively) is so obvious and true on-screen, and not a sappy, cheesy ""Hollywood"" special. Friendships that are too sappy (and fake) will kill a movie, but this one was so obviously real and strong that it touched we fans in such a deep way (for those who could appreciate it).I can't say everything I would like to about these movies. The marriage of deep friendship, dedication, and beautiful, realistic special effects creates an entrancing epic that will be hard to rival by any movie. Those who negatively rated these movies, did you actually pay any attention to the screen as you watched the movie? For those who have never seen these movies, please, do. The deep bonds shared by these actors, all of them, are so beautifully shown, and the cast clearly underwent a lot of stress (For those who own the Extended Versions of these movies, you might hear some horror stories from Astin, Wood, Mortensen, Serkis, and more, if you listen to the documentaries/commentaries), but it is clear that they love their roles, and it shines through in their voices, their faces, and especially their acting.I neglected to mention the efforts of the crew. Without them, over 5,000 people strong, these movies would not have been possible. They created Middle Earth in such way that it seemed possible to be a shadow of our past: a past world on Earth that faded away long before our time. Thanks be to them.Yes, there are differences from the books. There always are, in any adaptation. I saw that some people commented about how weak a character they thought Frodo seemed compared to the book, because several moments in which he looks Evil in the face were shortened/changed in the film version. That isn't true. Not at all. True heroism means not only defending others, but accepting aid from others. True heroism means that one accepts that they can't do everything alone, and accepts the aid of those willing to give it. THAT is true heroism. Frodo shows that in every light, even if it isn't always obvious. You can see with much more than your eyes...Overall, if these were the last movies I thought worthwhile enough to watch (I hope cinema doesn't become that bad), it would be fine by me. Thanks to all of the people who brought this to us, the LOTR fans. To my fellow fans, I say: ""May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out."" 10/10, and then some.","

"JayWolfgramm","1 September 2022","Let's take a moment and consider what a risk this was for New Line Cinema. It's the late 90's early 2000's and Peter Jackson comes in and wants over 100 million dollars to make a fantasy movie. Peter Jackson, a director whose previous credits include ""The Frighteners"" and ""Bad Taste"". Fantasy films were seen at the time as box office poison. Lord of the Rings was seen as a book that could not be adapted. It had a loyal fanbase, but the film adaptations had already tried and failed to bring in a return. And Jackson was wanting to film 3 movies altogether at once. This pitch must have sounded crazy. Thankfully for all involved they gave the greenlight and we got this wonderful film.This is the go to fil as an example of grand fantasy epic. The cinematography and effects are breathtaking, letting the audience grasp the huge scope of the adventure. The music by Howard Shore is pitch perfect, conveying triumph, mystery, sorrow and any emotion needed for the time. Although magical and mysterious, the film seamlessly explains the stakes and story to the audience. The action scenes are all well shot and the quest always feels like it is going forward.Along with the technical aspects of music and editing, what really holds this film together are the characters. All 9 members of the fellowship are casted and acted perfectly. All the characters the fellowship come across do a fantastic job. Christopher Lee as Saruman, that is the role this man was born to play. They bring these literary characters to life in such a way that I can't picture anyone else in the role.Compared to the other two films in the epic trilogy, this one is the most focused. As the films go on, the storyline will get split into the different side quests of the groups. But in this first one, save for cutting to Saruman, the story focuses primarily on the adventure of our fellowship. This is also the only one of the trilogy that has Enya do the end credits song, clearly all the other movies could have benefited from doing the same.I'm not sure what more I can add to the conversation that hasn't been said before. There is no other movie with such a long runtime that I have watched as often as Lord of the Rings. Prepare yourself for the adventure of a lifetime, the one fantasy film to rule them all.","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","25 December 2009","I have never read a single word of anything by Tolkien. This is not my genre; I have always disliked fantasy, and largely, adventure, as well. Prior to my viewing of this, I didn't care for Jackson, although The Frighteners had its moments. I put off watching this until tonight, where it was on TV. In other words, I cannot judge this as an adaptation, nor can I comment on the Extended Edition. What I can say is that this gripped me from the first frame and did not let go until the last one. That ought to give you an idea of how well-crafted and brilliantly executed a cinematic achievement it is. The plot is compelling and well-told. In spite of a large group of characters, this keeps track of, and develops, them all quite nicely. The acting is spot-on. I did find the comic relief to be annoying, but there's immensely little of it if you look at the overall running time, that aspect of it wasn't made for me(I can imagine kids enjoy it, and it's harmless and inoffensive), and it's easy enough to look past. This looks gorgeous all the way, and the effects are astonishing. The design of beings, locations and items is all creative and well-done. Cinematography and editing are excellent. This is very exciting, and the action is cool and has the impact it is meant to. The score helps the epic scope, and the foreign, non-human language-use makes the world we are seeing feel more strange and distant. There is nothing really offensive in this, though children might find the battle sequences too intense. I recommend this to everyone who can see themselves getting into this. 10/10","

"moviesleuth2","28 July 2008","Personally, I'm not a big fan of fantasy. I find it rather pretentious and for most entries into the genre, silly and/or melodramatic. But Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" is an exception. It's a grand adventure filled with limitless energy and likable characters. The series is at the top of the IMDb ""Top 250"" list, and rightly so. The first installment is extraordinary.I'm going to skip over the plot because by now everyone knows it. The acting is pitch-perfect across the board. Elijah Wood has clearly grown out of his kid roles, and is terrific as Frodo. His co-star Ian McKellen may have gotten the Oscar nod for his role, but Wood equals him. Likewise, McKellen finds the right note for Gandalf. Everyone else is perfectly suited for their roles as well. Special note goes to Sean Bean, who made a career out of playing creeps and villains, is successful as Boromir, and shows that he has more range than people may give him credit for.The stakes were incredibly high for this film series, and obviously it paid off. Peter Jackson deserves much of the credit. His work here is the fantasy answer to George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" saga. Unlike much of today's CGI, it wasn't done cheaply, and everything looks authentic, and the result is breathtaking. It's hard to tell what's real and what's not. But Jackson's skill goes beyond the effects. Much of the acclaim of Tolkien's series is the fact that he created a whole new world. Jackson does the same thing; it doesn't feel like a bunch of effects were added to sets or everything was in front of a blue screen. Jackson has created a whole new world, just like Tolkien did.Of course, this would not be worth anything if Jackson and his co-writers hadn't written a screen adaptation that was worthy of the book (which I have not read). Everything moves smoothly and nothing feels left out or short-changed.Many films have been destroyed by too much hype. But ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is so grand that nothing could diminish its spectacle. And what a film to deserve it!","

"sdillon-1","25 July 2003","CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERSJRR Tolkien's staggering trilogy The Lord of the Rings is my favourite novel of all time.  To call it the literary equivalent of the (original) Star Wars trilogy if anything undersells it, as much of Star Wars is inspired by it. When I heard Peter Jackson was going to make films of my `precious' books I was nervous to say the least.  How could he possibly succeed?Then, in December 2001, I breathed an immense sigh of relief combined with an almighty gasp of delighted surprise.  The first film in the trilogy not only lived up to expectations, it surpassed them.  If anything, the film was better than the book.  I say this simply because cinema is my preferred artistic medium.  What Peter Jackson did was not merely film the book (as was the case with the first two Harry Potter films) but instead translated it into cinema.  Jackson emphasised what was cinematically potent, reinvented a number of sequences and trimmed a few others with the apparent motto `show don't tell', which is of course what great cinema does.The resultant adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring is an unmitigated masterpiece.  A dynamic, epic, beautiful and sweeping work that knocks the socks of anything in the fantasy genre since Star Wars in 1977.  It is nothing less than criminal that it didn't win the Oscar for best picture.The deceptively simple plot can be summed up in one phrase: `evil ring must be destroyed'.  For this to happen, representatives of all races in Middle Earth - Humans, Hobbits, Elves, Dwarfs etc - must unite against the forces of evil led by the Dark Lord Sauron who wants to regain the great Ring to rule and cover all the world in darkness.The complicated backstory is brilliantly rendered in a splendid prologue outlining the history of the Ring and how it came to be in the hands of the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins.  Bilbo's nephew, Frodo, takes up the quest to destroy the Ring with the help of wizard Gandalf and a fellowship representing the other races in Middle Earth.The ensuing adventure is so full of excitement, adventure, humour, irony, melancholy, terror and tragedy that it really is impossible to describe the emotions of the story in a few words.  Although the plot deals specifically with the timeless theme of good versus evil, it also encompasses complex issues such as immortality, temptation, and growing up.  There have been several misguided attempts at pinning Tolkien's work down in allegorical terms, most recently to the post September 11th war against terrorism.  To do this is to miss the point.  Tolkien himself claimed his work was neither allegorical or topical.  It was instead intended to be a `fake history' or mythology for England and Europe, rooted deeply in his Christian beliefs.The casting in the film is impeccable.  Sir Ian McKellen simply is Gandalf, Elijah Wood excels as Frodo, Viggo Mortensen is superbly rugged as hushed-up-King Aragorn, Ian Holm makes a tragic and moving Bilbo, Sean Bean is wonderful as Boromir - a man gradually seduced by the evil of the Ring, and Christopher Lee is great as turncoat wizard Saruman to name just a few.The cinematography is staggeringly beautiful, making great use of breathtaking New Zealand locations.  The special effects and production design are groundbreaking.  Editing and sound are both first-rate.
Finally, Howard Shore's magnificent music score deserves a special mention, the best I've heard of its type this side of Star Wars.  Not only does he manage to create a sweeping work similar to a full-blown opera, but he manages to incorporate Elvish poems and songs that were an frequent feature of the novel unable to be included elsewhere.The extended edition of the film is an interesting alternative edit, with new bits and pieces which are all good (especially for fans of the book), but to be honest it doesn't matter which version you see.  The film's staggering attention to detail, its unswerving conviction and its brisk pace (not a duff moment in its entire running time) make this quite simply one third of the greatest fantasy film ever made.","

"FiendishDramaturgy","8 September 2003","I wasn't going to review this movie. There are hundreds of reviews on it and I frankly wasn't going to waste my time repeating the same words of praise.When I first learned that they were doing these movies, I thought, ""Great! Another series of movies I'll hate, modeled after a trilogy of books that I love."" Stephen King's work, being a prime example. I love the literary works, and the movies all just die on the screen; be it big or little. Then I learned that Peter Jackson was directing it and I was even less eager to see the movies. I never liked the Frighteners and Meet the Feebles?! Wow, did that movie stink UP the place!And then I discovered they had no plans of making the prequel; ""The Hobbit,"" and that was that. I wasn't going to like the movie, and I refused to be excited about it. Any of it. But then, I was GIVEN tickets as an early Yule present and so I begrudgingly attended its premier here in the Smokies. I was very pleasantly surprised. I ended up seeing this movie twice in the theaters, and have since bought the extended edition gift set of this work.The opening sequence was so well done, that I couldn't find any reason at all to not accept it. They didn't do ""The Hobbit,"" true enough, but they filled in that time and gave the viewers enough of the beginning that I could thoroughly subscribe to the movie.Many critics have literally bashed Peter Jackson's omission of one of the characters in Frodo's party, but the character was hardly relevant to the plot, the storyline, or the story itself and was best left out. I didn't even miss old Tom ""what'shisname,"" to tell you the truth.I do have a problem with Aragorn's character's emotionality in the movie. His character in the book was a seasoned Ranger. His emotional instability; ie: his crying openly scene after scene, is completely out of character. It lends to the storyline with Arwen, and furthers the movie along, true enough, and personally, I didn't mind it. It was just out of character. He's rough, he's tough; a seasoned ranger. He shouldn't have been as emotionally portrayed as Jackson did him, although the reasons are clearly due to time constraints. It would have taken forever to develop Aragorn properly, and they frankly did not have enough time, even with the three-plus hours of screen time.BUT, Jackson's characters were very well developed, the story was very well told. There was a LOT of dialog, but there was a lot of detail that would've been left out; many, many finer details that never would've been able to be expressed without the richness of dialogue and Jackson and his company saw that, thankfully.All in all, as a Tolkien fan from WAY back, I feel that Peter Jackson did a marvelous job with this, the opening edition of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It rates so far above, ""The Godfather"" trilogy (to which it has been compared), that there IS no comparison.The acting is exemplary. There is no stiffness, no badly delivered lines, no hesitation in performance. Sean Astin truly and greatly surprised me with his brilliant performance as SamWise. The scenery and cinematography is brilliant. The sets and scenes are so well done, I only spied a single flaw...and I was looking! There was a car in the background of one shot! But the car will be missing from the DVD release, I'm sure.The wardrobing and costumes were finely hand-made; treated to look worn and imperfect, as they should and the Shire was so well done, I was as delighted as any child on Yule morning. But the thing which captured me the most and held me spellbound was the casting. They put just the right people into just the right roles. I simply loved the characters.. Each and every one of them felt just like the book (except for the deviation I already mentioned about Aragorn's emotional state).First we had ""The Godfather,"" then we were given the ""Star Wars"" trilogy and now, we have the Lord of the Rings to love. I look forward with great anticipation to the rest of this series.Thank you, Peter Jackson, for giving of yourself to this extent. It is above and beyond all for which I could have hoped. This first installment rates a full 10/10 from...the Fiend :.","

"dxia","11 April 2004","The reason why this first part of Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' is superior to his latter two parts is because of restraint. Jackson was restrained from over doing it with the CGI and ""epic"" battle sequences, which in my opinion does not make a story epic. Part of the reason was simply because Tolkien did not have very many battles in the first part of his book, which thankfully forced Jackson to focus on creating a believable world rather than a believable hack-n-slash action movie.I don't find much entertainment in watching people mutilate each other, but I love it when a movie engages me in a world, and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' does just that. Certainly the most breathtaking scenes in the movie are the moments of patient observation, when the camera pans around and captures the beautiful settings of Middle Earth. I must give Jackson credit. He did hire some very extraordinary artists that have envisioned one of the grandest interpretations of Tolkien's world.There are about five particular moments that stick out in my mind and gave me that tingle of goosebumps down my spine when I saw them for the first time. The first is the introduction to Hobbiton. After the somewhat awkward prologue, I was beginning to have my doubts to whether the movie would live up to the book. But the movie surprised me. Hobbiton is perfect. The houses have flower patches and old fences, the roads look worn and made through decades of travel, and the Old Mill spins with the laziness of a quiet town. Every color is vibrant and every moment looks as through it was taken out of a picture book. Although I still don't agree with the particular look of the Hobbits, I believe everything else in Hobbiton is worthy of Tolkien's words.The second moment comes after Frodo's awakening in Rivendell, and the third, during the exploration of the Halls of Moria. In both moments, the camera pans away from the characters and outward into a static shot of their surroundings. The moments make us feel like we're turning our heads and gazing at the world around us just as the characters do. The golden waterfalls of the elven city mark an interesting contrast with the dark halls of the dwarfish mines, but each are inspiring in their own ways and add to feeling of being engaged in a living world.My other favorite moments come during the exploration of Lothlorien and the passage down the Anduin. And while I won't go into detail about the scenes, since they really should be experienced without any prior expectations, they are monuments in imaginative cinema. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is one of those rare movies that I always wish I could reexperience for the first time. Unfortunately, Jackson turned away from exploring Middle Earth in his next two movies, and instead, turned to fighting and warfare. He seems to take a lot of pride in the love story and battle sequences he created in 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King,' but it is was in his first movie when he really got it right. In 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' it's okay if the characters are uninteresting and have silly dialogue. Middle Earth is the star, and the characters are the ones seeing it for the first time.","

"SLionsCricketreviews","24 November 2015","Released to immense critical success, ""The Lord of the Rings"" was for a long time considered a novel that could never been adapted into a motion picture. Such a perception was virtually rendered idiotic when ""The Fellowship of the Ring was released to cinemas in 2001, garnering the respect of both critics and fans alike. To this day, it seems the near perfect adaptation of a novel to a film. Frodo Baggins is tasked with setting out to destroy The One Ring, a weapon forged by Sauron during the Second Age of Middle Earth. He is accompanied by eight other companions, into a company known as The Fellowship of the Ring, to go to Mt. Doom to destroy this all powerful weapon. Jackson's abilities as a filmmaker were not too well tested prior to this near impossible project, so for New Line Cinemas to give Peter Jackson the rights to Tolkien Estate can be considered foolish. How can a director, with only two noteworthy credits in ""Heavenly Creatures"" and ""The Frighteners"" exceed such a reputation to bring forth J.R.R Tolkien's vision to life? Yet, what Peter Jackson managed to do with cast and crew, is now an inspiration. For ""The Lord of the Rings"" to work as an adaptation, the casting must be near perfect. The world is foreign to many viewers, the characters often are not human characters (though they obviously possess human traits) so the cast must be able to evoke a sense of humanity into them. Elijah Wood is wonderful as Frodo, conveying a sense of naivety but also a sense of extreme courage and determination. Sir Ian McKellen is phenomenal as Gandalf, calm and reassuring at all times, but also very kind and caring towards Frodo especially. Viggo Mortensen captures Aragorn seamlessly, his struggles with dealing with a failed bloodline and his desires to escape his duty to his people. Then there is Sean Bean, whose portrayal of Boromir is stunning. The only member of the Fellowship to be killed (and not resurrected), Boromir's presence is ever lasting during the trilogy. Virtually a broken warrior, mostly due to his father's extreme demands and the declining of Gondor as a kingdom. Sean Bean, in many scenes, perfectly captures the moral complexities the character faces. We see in his conversations with Aragorn that he desires to do good for his people, but brings himself to do it in an immoral manner. We see during the course of the film that he is further broken down in spirit, culminating in a moment where he attempts to seize the Ring by force from Frodo. Almost immediately realizing his mistake, he gives life for Merry and Pippin. He is forgiven for his wrongdoings by Aragorn, who then promises the longevity of their people. The redemption of Boromir also enforces into Aragorn a necessary responsibility he must begin to accept: he is heir to the throne of Gondor. When reading through the first two volumes of J.R.R Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" novel, there are moments throughout that feel utterly unnecessary. The major event being the hobbits meeting Tom Bombadil as the Nazgul chase the hobbits. This event constitutes an entire chapter, and in the process, diminishes from the suspense and momentum that had been established. Peter Jackson, realizing the event has little significance on the overall plot, omitted this, to the indignation of most fans of the novel. Peter Jackson, alongside Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens, wrote a near perfect script that wonderfully represents the nature of the book. One of the fine little touches, that fans have enjoyed, is the quick set of events that occur after the hobbits leave town, such as ""concerning hobbits"" or ""a shortcut to mushrooms"" - chapters from Tolkien's novel are tightly condensed and converted into a cinematic medium through which they can be accessed. The cinematography to this series of films can be described as swooping, breathtaking and majestic. And it certainly is. But it also provides a means to an experience. Why many fans of the series find it an experience is due to the cinematography, as the camera is rarely static but always in motion. Contrasting this with the prequels to Lucas' ""Star Wars"", the camera is fixed and the actors are given limited space through which to act. Those films feel like a mental prison, the viewer is stuck under the confines the characters are stuck and cannot escape. Of course, this notion applies very differently when considering films like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" but for fantasy/sci-fi adventures such as ""Star Wars"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"", the cinematography must be enriching. It provides an experience, rather than just a mere film. Starting with ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", this series of films is certainly an experience. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" remains a defining achievement in modern cinema, it re-invented and redefined the meaning of a blockbuster and has paved the way for countless fantasy films. Arguably the greatest of its genre, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" deserves every ounce of respect it gets. It is one of a rare kind of films that is so perfect in every aspect, from music to acting, from direction to cinematography, from editing to sound design, that to refute its importance to cinema is foolish. Peter Jackson did the seemingly impossible task of adapting one of the great pieces of literature into one of the great pieces of cinema.","

"jon.h.ochiai","12 January 2002","Peter Jackson's first installment of the J.R.R. Tolkien, ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" is masterful work with another outstanding performance from Sir Ian McKellen and a star-making performance from Viggo Mortensen as the Ranger, Strider. I have not read the Tolkien trilogy, though I was read ""The Hobbit"" way back in sixth grade. So I am not familiar with the Tolkien mythology and legacy. From what is presented on screen, screenwriters, Frances Walsh, Phillippa Boyens, and Jackson, have crafted a story of magic, courage, and honor. Peter Jackson gets great performances out of a large and talented cast, manages stunning visuals that never overwhelm the movie, and maintains a coherent narrative style. The narrative at the movie's beginning was necessary for a novice like myself. The One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron must be destroyed or all will be lost in Middle-earth. The Ring possesses great power and the seductive power of evil. The Ring that has been lost for 2500 years ends up in the hands of Hobbit, Frodo (Elija Wood). The powerful wizard, Gandalf (Ian McKellan) recognizes the Ring for what it is. Frodo's charge is to destroy the Ring. Soon a Fellowship is formed to aid Frodo in his quest. There are Elves, Dwarfs, Hobbits, Orcs, and Humans along the way. The journey is filled both with bravery and betrayal. Gandalf's master, Saruman (Christopher Lee), has aligned himself with Lord Sauron. The Ranger, Strider (Viggo Mortensen), becomes the protector of the brave Frodo. The first hour moves very slow under the weight of the material and set up. The last two hours of the movie move briskly. This is a very stuffed 3 hour movie that does not feel longer than that, or shorter. What makes ""Fellowship of the Rings"" so captivating is it's tale of heroes and great warriors. Elija Wood does an amazing job in the transformation of Frodo. At first Frodo is overwhelmed by the responsibility he undertakes, then he sees that he must do what is right, and he realizes that he is not alone. Wood combines the anxiety and courage magically. Ian McKellan is awesome as Gandalf. As the powerful and aging wizard he is the leader that inspires greatness in others. Viggo Mortensen as Strider/ Aragorn is charismatic, and the soul of the ""Fellowship."" Strider is a great warrior and a true samurai. Strider gives his word to Frodo that he will protect him with his life, and he keeps his word. Mortensen plays Strider as man of few words, backed up by action, compassion, and seemingly haunted by a dark secret. He absolutely commands the screen. Also impressive are Orlando Bloom as Legolas, the Elf archer, and Sean Bean as the warrior Boromir, who battles the seductive power of the Ring. Cate Blanchett also gives a great performance as Galadriel, the muse of this Fellowship. Liv Tyler is beautiful as Arwen, though she does have much of a role in this installment.Peter Jackson's ""Fellowship of the Ring"" is masterful storytelling with great performances from a very talented cast. I look forward to rest of the movies.","

"Karma_K2","2 April 2002","WOW!! First off, those who complain about the film...ARE YOU NUTS?!?! Films are merely forms of entertainment remember? And this film was very entertaining. The special effects were EXCELLENT!! I have to admit; I fell in love with a couple of actors after watching this movie. Hugo Weaving - always a favourite - made a delicious elf, as did Orlando Bloom. YUMMY!! Ian McKellen was lovely as Gandalf the Grey - GOOD MOVE! And Christopher Lee was really creepy as Saruman the White, but then again, isn't he always?Now to those who say that this movie has no plot, are you people blind? The plot is right there!! I'll spell it out for you. *Old hobbit (Bilbo) has evil ring, bequeaths it to young hobbit nephew (Frodo) *Frodo and 3 hobbit friends (Merry, Pippin and Samwise) directed by wizard Gandalf to embark on a journey to Rivendale (home of yummy elves) to give ring to elves for safekeeping. Unfortunately, no go. *4 hobbits continue journey with other members of fellowship of ring (Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Sauron) *Encounter danger *One dies *Journey to be continued in next movie Very basic, and I've probably left out a lot, but there you go.I really enjoyed this movie like you wouldn't believe - how DID ""A Beautiful Mind"" beat it? (Mind you, Russell Crowe is a pretty solid actor.) As a fantasy movie it rivals ""Harry Potter"", I loved it that much. (And I LOVED ""Harry Potter"" - especially Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape) All I have left to say is: 2 thumbs up; 10/10; ***** out of *****.","

"Rogue-32","26 February 2002","I've seen the film three times now and it gets better with each viewing. Peter Jackson told Charlie Rose (on tv) the other night that he wanted to make a film which transported him to another place, like the films he saw as a child did; he said films didn't really do that very much these days. I could not agree with him more.  This was one of the things that impressed me the most on my first viewing (that and the towering - no put intended - performance by Ian McKellan) - I DID get the feeling I was in a different world, a different time, and I TOO have been missing that in films.  Thank you, Peter.  I am hungrily awaiting the next two.","

"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","19 December 2021","Based on the first installment of the trilogy of J. R. R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring tells the story about a dark lord named Sauron who created the powerful ring that would rule all of Middle Earth. Despite the dark lord being destroyed, the spirit of the ring lived on for ages until one day, Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit leaves the Shire and leaves the ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins. However, Sauron's army seeks to find the One Ring and kill anyone who carries it. Aided by Gandalf, a powerful wizard, three hobbit friends Sam, Merry and Pippin along with Aragorn, a strider, Gimli, a dwarf, Legolas, an elf, and Boromir of Gondor, the group set off on a journey to Mount Doom and send the One Ring back to the fires where it was created.When I was a kid I was only into cartoons and then I came across the 1978 cartoon from Ralph Bakshi when it was on video (only parts of it until I saw the whole thing when it was on Cartoon Network) Later, when I was a teenage, I finally got into watching the trilogy and needless to say, I was blown away. This film is not only a great start to the trilogy but it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Not to mention that it got me into reading the book trilogy which is well written full of beautiful world building, great characters, an interesting lore surrounding Middle Earth, and engrossing action.The story is great and keeps up with the spirit of the source material. Not only that, it has emotional moments and great action sequences while having some character depth. The pacing while slow is very lively, the editing is superb, the directing from Peter Jackson is solid, and the cinematography is very gorgeous. Even the costumes are well designed.The music score from Howard Shore is great. Epic haunting, and sad which gives a neat atmosphere to the film especially the themes of Middle Earth and the characters as well. And last but not least the actors.Acting-wise, everyone gives a stellar performance. The late actors Christopher Lee and Ian Holm did great as Saruman the wizard who gathers Sauron's forces and Bilbo Baggins the hobbit who got possessed by the ring for a long time. The other actors did a great job too. Ian McKellen did fantastic as Gandalf the Grey, Viggo Mortensen did stellar as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom and John Rhy Davies did great as Legolas and Gimli, Sean Bean did a nice job as the corrupted Boromir, Liv Tyler and Hugo Heaving did great as Arwen and Lord Elrond, and the actors who played the hobbits did a stellar job too.Elijah Wood as the vulnerable hobbit Frodo, Sean Astin as his loyal friend Sam, and Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan did great as Pippin and Merry who share some nice humor while providing some loyalty too.Overall The Fellowship of the Ring is a great start to the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy and a solid adaptation of the book. It's been 20 years since it came out in the US.","

"asticht-2","9 August 2005","For those of you like myself who are fans of the books of the same name,you will not be disappointed by this movie. Unlike the animated versions that have previously been made where much of the story was condensed either for budgetary constraints or time limits, the Fellowship of the Ring while it does take a few shortcuts, there are very few. It is very exciting getting to see places that up until now have been purely figments of my imagination portrayed by someones elses imagination on the silver screen. I felt myself holding my breath waiting to see the various locations of middle earth and how others have dreamed of them. The movie does a breathtaking job in transporting the viewer to this other world and does so with magic good enough to be from the hand of Gandalf himself. Yes, there are places where for dramatic reasons or to prevent a lengthy historical context that certain events from the book were either shortened, modified or changed. These changes however do not change the storyline itself and makes for a very entertaining movie. I do feel however that if you are one of the uninitiated, it would serve you to either read the book before going, or immediately after the film pick up a copy and read it as it will provide more breadth to the story than what an almost three hour film can portray. In addition, there are several scenes in the book that while not central to the main story, add more to the lore of middle earth and help to explain some of the history leading up to the time of the story. The characterizations in the film were very well done and the choices of the actors to play the hobbits were perfect. While I was somewhat anxious to have Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Samwise, after seeing how well they were portrayed on film left me no doubt that these actors did a very admirable job bringing the characters to life. The majority of the cast has some English accent which was my main concern. Both the principle American actors portrayed a passable English type accent themselves which helped prevent them standing out on their own. How the filmmakers made several average height men such as Wood and Astin, and probably more so John Rhys Davies as Gimli appear much smaller than their Elvish or human companions is spellbinding. Special effects in this movie while at first don't really seem to be that obvious eventually take on a more obvious tone as the fellowship moves further into the adventure. As one would expect from a magical world, many things which we take for granted from reading the books are very difficult to accurately portray in a live action presentation. The filmmakers not only did a good job, they surpassed by far my expectations and truly made the experience an enjoyable and fulfilling one. As with any film where there will be sequels coming out, the ending left me longing for December 2002 to follow our adventurers further on their quest.I will caution parents who are thinking of taking their children to see this movie that it is not a movie made or intended for children. Much Parental Guidance and forethought should be taken before taking children under 12 to this film. Aside from a film which lasts almost three hours in length where much of the dialogue while important to the story is not well suited to entertain small children. In addition, several of the creatures created for the film will probably terrify younger audiences. If you want to take your children to see this film, I might caution you to view it without them first and then decide to take them on your own judgement. Hey, if you do see it first without them, you can see it again right? I plan on seeing it more than once anyway. All in all, this is a well developed motion picture where a great deal of thought went into it's development and execution. I am thankful to the filmmakers for having the courage to tackle such a well known, well loved story with an audience that has a very well organized preconceived notion of how they view the world of Tolkien. The filmmakers did the book justice and that is the bottom line unlike Bakshi's version of 1978 which was a disappointment at best and unfinished as it's final release turned out to be.","

"gcsman","2 April 2023","Just back from seeing Fellowship of the Ring at a special screening from one of our local indy cinemas. I have the Extended Editions of all three on DVD, but I'd never seen the EE on the big screen before, and wow was it worth it. It's an immersive experience like little else I've ever had at the movies. The audience I was in was filled (mostly) with people too young to have seen the original release back in 2001, or else parents who would have gone to the original now taking their kids to it. The whole theater was raptly silent through it all, laughed and gasped at the appropriate places, and applauded at the end. I really think the Extended Editions take care of most of the shortcomings or gaps in the original theater-release versions, and by now should be the canonical versions.All three of the LOTR films get a 10/10 from me, but you can make a reasonable argument that Fellowship is the best of them. There's so much material, so much ground to cover, done so well! It has the crucial job of starting off the epic task of building an entire world in front of our eyes, setting the scene, and introducing most of the key characters: and the stakes were high. Had this opener failed, the rest of the trilogy would have been dead in the water and maybe would have brought down New Line Cinema with it. Scene after scene that sticks in the memory: the lengthy Introduction with Cate Blanchett's silky voice narrating. The Shire, of course. The inn at Bree, and Weathertop. The ride to the fords of Bruinen. Rivendell and the Council of Elrond. Moria and the bridge of Khavad-Dum. Lothlorien. The Riven Anduin, the Argonath, Boromir, the splitting of the Fellowship. Peter Jackson and his immense New Zealand crew succeeded in conjuring an entire self-consistent universe for us to live in that, still, no other fantasy movie has ever come close to achieving. And in each of the three movies there are scenes that I can only call transcendent -- so riveting and cinematically brilliant that they leap right into your heart. One of these is the Mirror of Galadriel. In Two Towers, the very opening. In Return of the King, the chain of signal fires. And think of the major role of Howard Shore's musical score; hyper-romantic, heroic, edgy, comforting, delicate by turns; his themes (leitmotifs, really, like Wagner operas) are as dominant as any character. It's kind of impossible to recall any part of the trilogy without that musical score running through your head. For years, one friend of mine listened to the score on an almost weekly basis, and who can fault him?One VERY important thing that struck me right from the first viewing back in 2001 was how much attention was paid to the historical context of Middle-Earth. We're looking at a world that has already had thousands of years of history and conflict. It's an old civilization and the sense of deep history is being put right in front of us -- the old watchtower of Amon Sul (Weathertop), the ancient mines of Moria and the dwarven halls, the immense old statues of the Argonath, crumbling ruins from ages past, everywhere the Fellowship goes. What's being played out in LOTR at the end of the Third Age is really just the end-game to a long, long story stretching back to the First Age, when the ultimate lord of evil Morgoth was defeated by the gods at Thangorodrim. The equally long Second Age finished up with the Last Alliance of Elves and Men on the slopes of Mount Doom in a bigger, more titanic battle than anything the Third Age would see. This richness of invention is incredibly impressive.And then there's the cast. This series made stars out of Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, Karl Urban, Sean Astin, and half a dozen others in career-defining roles. The already-big stars like Cate Blanchett and Ian McKellen and Hugo Weaving rose further, and two decades later they are indelibly linked with their LOTR roles.I want to go on and on but I'd be repeating what you can find in any number of reviews elsewhere. So to say again, the LOTR film trilogy is a bloody miracle. Inevitable followups have come along (the Hobbit trilogy of course, and the new Rings of Power series) that are actually not bad. Taken on their own merit, they have great production values and decent acting. It's just that they can't match up to one of the high-water marks of all of cinematic history.I'm still waiting for someone (Peter Jackson, are you listening?) to take on the story that was actually Tolkien's favorite, the one closest to his heart. That's the one with Luthien and Beren, Morgoth and the First Age, the one that set off his whole work on the history of Middle-Earth. Gods, demigods, heroes, monsters, romance, pure good and evil and everything in between -- it's got it all just like LOTR. Well, maybe someday.","

"David, Film Freak","11 January 2002","Well what can I say? Without sounding like a broken record, this is, quite frankly, a masterpiece.The first of three films about a young Hobbit's quest to return an evil ring, titled 'The Fellowship of the Ring', this picture is brilliant in every sense of the word.The lush New Zealand scenery portrays a bold and beautiful Middle Earth, while the superb casting of the main cast (including Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood and Liv Tyler) are perfectly picked for their intriguing and detailed characters.I cannot praise this movie enough. Everything about it - the special FX, the score, the scenery, the plot, the cast - is all fantastic, and for the 3 hours the film runs, it manages to grab you and take you on a spellbinding journey into the imaginary world in which they inhabit... something 'Harry Potter' could never do. 11/10.","

What made me definitely like it is the way it gets really emotional towards the end.

The Special Effects never get old, arent too much......a little bit old-school, a little big cgi, everything great and not too much like...:The Hobbit, and unworthy Follow-Trilogy of That Masterpiece of 3 Movies !Greetings From Germany !","

"numenorsniper-66396","4 February 2022","No other film trilogy is as strong, not by measure of their individual parts nor as the complete saga, and I doubt that there will ever be any trilogy to take the crown from LOTR.I saw all three multiple times in the cinema upon their release, and countless times at home since, including a few 15 hour marathons of their extended versions which once viewed are forever indispensable by comparison to their theatrical versions. The commentary tracks and behind-the-scenes footage on the extended versions are just brilliant.LOTR has been a core part of my life for over 20 years, as of the writing of this review. I've been obsessed with the films, books, games, music, and everything about it really. Alongside the Halo saga and all that includes such as its music, LOTR is the best, and both started in the same year.I just now hope that the upcoming LOTR tv series doesn't screw it up too badly.","

"spider_webster","3 June 2005","I absolutely love this movie, partly because the acting is really good, but also for the CGI effects and the good storyline. I watched the extended version and realized that it isn't boring like some people think because some people I know think that FOTR is quite a lengthy movie because of all the talking, but in my opinion, if there's not talking, there's no story! If they just jumped to the fighting scenes without any of the introduction, then you won't know where the movie started from. I love the scenes where they get to fight, whether Orcs or Nazgul, the fighting scenes are still the climax of the movie.Another good movie to see after FOTR is TTT, of course. It is the second part of this great trilogy and there are more climatic scenes. Most probably, you'll enjoy that more than FOTR but don't shun this movie just because it's a bit lengthy.Overall, it's a great movie to see and it is really worth spending the money to buy/rent the extended/special DVD to watch too. Definitely a 10 out of 10 on my scale! Actually, in my opinion, 10/10 doesn't even come close!","

"joshuadrake-39480","12 May 2015","I decided to do something new with this movie review. I will not only review the first film, I will review the entire trilogy. The plot follows Frodo Baggins as he goes on a journey to destroy the One Ring and with the help of the Fellowship and his friend, Samwise Gamgee and the evil / good creature Gollum, he is able to destroy the One Ring in the one place that he is created: Mount Doom.I love this trilogy and to this day, I think it is one of my favorite trilogies (others include The Matrix trilogy, the original and prequel STAR WARS trilogies, THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY and the original X-MEN trilogy), but I really thought that this trilogy was amazing and Peter Jackson gets a lot of praise for this film, King Kong, Tintin and the Hobbit trilogy and it is really amazing.The first 2 films are nearly three hours long, but the last film The Return of the King is 3 hours and 20 minutes long and I thought that would be way too long, but after the find ended I was not angry or bored.When I first watched The Fellowship of the Ring, it kept me interested and very amazed from beginning to the end, after that I watched The Two Towers, and it kept me emotionally engaged until the end credits and I was impressed with the climactic fight scene at Helm's Deep, then I finally got to The Return of the King and I could have not been happier with this one, it not only made a billion dollars when released in the theaters, but it won all 11 Oscars including Best Picture, making the third film the only fantasy film to win in each category.Not only you can get interested in the movies, you can also get interested in the characters and action, as well as the plot. Frodo is a cool character, played by Elijah Wood and his performance is amazing. Ian McKellen as Gandalf the White / Gandalf the Grey is really cool and amazing, he is a character that he is amazing, and his performance was great and I was angry that he did not get an Oscar for this role. Also, he was playing Magneto during production of the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the first, second and third X-MEN films.The character I was horrified about the first time I saw this film was Gollum, because of his split personality between Smeagol and Gollum and it was amazing to see him on screen, Andy Serkis played him and I liked him as Gollum in this trilogy and the first film in THE HOBBIT trilogy, An Unexpected Journey (2012), which was released in December 2012 and I did see it and I did see the second film and I really enjoyed it. My favorite scene is where Gollum is talking to himself and that was really funny and just well acted by Andy Serkis and this would lead him into playing the title role in Peter Jackson's KING KONG 2005 remake and Caesar, later on in RISE of the PLANET of the APES and DAWN of the PLANET of the APES and I can't wait to see him as Caesar in the next ""Planet of the Apes"" reboot film.These movies have some fantastic dialogue and action, especially in the second and third film. Every battle in this trilogy is amazingly well-done and spectacular and the added great CGI for this film trilogy.My favorite battles in The Fellowship of the Ring are when Arwen (played by Liv Tyler) saves Frodo and the battle inside Balin's Tomb and that was incredible and spectacular. My favorite battle in The Two Towers is the very, very, VERY long battle at Helm's Deep, that battle sequence was amazingly well-done. My favorite battle in The Return of the King is the end battle because there are two things happening: Frodo destroying the Ring and fighting Gollum and the entire Fellowship fighting against the Orcs.The cinematography, visual effects, production design, creature design, make-up effects, editing, musical score and atmosphere of this movie was an amazing job and it was also incredible and the direction by Peter Jackson is amazingly well-done and fantastic.Overall, this trilogy of films are incredible with every movie released and every time I watch these films are incredibly amazing. Yes, I will always love The Fellowship of the Ring for starting this trilogy, but The Two Towers is amazing and is a great improvement over the first film. My favorite one is the trilogy is The Return of the King, because it has better character development, better action sequences, better acting, better music and visual effects and most of all, the best ending to a film trilogy. I know a lot of people think that the ending is way too long in the third film, but I'm used to watching three to four hour long films at all. This is one trilogy that I don't think gets enough critical praise and credit.FINAL SCORE FOR ALL THREE LORD OF THE RINGS FILMS: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - 8/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - 9/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - 10/10 FINAL SCORE for the entire trilogy will be a 9.5 / 10","

"williambendavis-933-218958","25 December 2014","I have to say Peter Jackson did a freaking amazing job at translating this into film. He got everything down to a tee. The sweeping cinematography captures the enormousness of Middle Earth as well as provides for some beautiful eye candy. The combination of practical and special effects allow for some extraordinarily detailed scenes that really bring Tolkien's world to life. The casting is absolutely perfect. Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian Mckellan as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom as Legolas?, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Sean Bean as Boromir, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, and Christopher Lee as Saruman? You simply cannot do better than that, and I applaud whoever did the casting. All these things come together to form a masterpiece of a film that is the start to one of the best trilogies of all time.","

"thierryserra-05310","14 June 2019","I'm a huge fan of medieval fantasy. And J. R. R. Tolkien is the father of the genre. I read the book and lived it. But when the movie aired, it blew my mind. Many scenes were exactly as I had imagined them, and many were way better.
Direction is flawless, performances are extraordinary, photography is breath taking with incredible locations and the story is perfectly narrated. And the music is incredible. Enya's song brings tears to my eyes.
The only thing you could ask of this movie is more! But wait... there IS more. Two more movies follow AND if you buy the DVD special edition, you get 30 more minutes of film. Well worth it. You get to see the hobbits actually fight and even kill a few orcs.
One of the best fantasy movies ever.","

"ericjg623","20 March 2002","I am not normally much of a fan of the `Sword & Sorcery' genre, but this movie just blew me away. The visuals, the acting, the storytelling, all are simply superb. There's plenty of CGI and special effects, but unlike certain other movies (Terminator 2, for example) they do not dominate the film, but merely enhance the basic plot.  This is without doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen, and certainly the best of the past year. If this doesn't dominate the Oscars, then Hollywood is in a state of serious denial. Films like this is what movies are supposed to be all about. 10+ out of 10","

"kismit","11 January 2002","I saw this one in the theatre for the second time which I have not done since the advent of VHS. As a fan of the book my one complaint is there were some very good things left out which I regret will not be seen until the film is remade again in 20 years. There is simply too much material and for those who haven't read the book this is a shame. I don't doubt Jackson could have made the film quite a bit better if he had had the desire and license to take a hatchet to the source material and fashion it into a more conventional screenplay. This really would have involved working some level of closure into FOTR that was was not in the book. Has there ever been another movie made that was so clearly only a third of the whole story? I am really surprised at how many non readers of the book enjoyed the film. This is one movie where people where people who saw the film first will be blown away by the book.","

"tripwires","13 March 2002","I hate Star Wars. Granted, I have never seen any of the films, but seeing clips from it during various awards ceremonies and things like that tell me I never want to see any of them, the originals included. I'm also not a big fan of fantasy films, so it was pretty damn daring of me to make that statement in the summary box.The thing is, The Fellowship of the Ring just REEKS with brilliance. Every single second of the movie is astounding, from the first battlefield scene until the last few scenes. I don't need to watch any other fantasy flicks to know that this is the best. Now, I'm not a Tolkien reader. I bought ""FOTR"" after watching the film and watching a National Geographic documentary on his life. I've owned the book for maybe 3 months now, and so far I'm still at page 94, thereabout. But I have seen the movie 3 times. And each time, it just got better. Peter Jackson deserves all the best director awards the industry could ever give for his beautiful masterpiece. How he managed not to get the Golden Globe for Best Director is beyond me. Actually, how anyone can think that this picture is anything but brilliant is beyond me. 3-hours too long? Hell no. 3-hours too short. I truly hope the Academy awards Mr. Jackson for his great eye for detail, and all-round awesome direction, and I sincerely think this movie is Best Picture material. The acting is also superb. I've always liked Elijah Wood, but I loved him in this. Not only are his eyes beautiful, he is able to speak volumes with them. I don't understand how the Academy and the rest have managed to overlook him for a Best Actor award. Orlando Bloom is devastatingly gorgeous as Legolas. He has captured the hearts of teenaged girls the whole world over, myself included. You can't blame us. Legolas is the perfect man you'd want by your side in times of danger. His movements are agile, like a cat's, and you couldn't tell in the movie that Bloom has taken only 2 (or was it 3?) months of archery classes. My only gripe about the character was that there wasn't much developement in the movie. I hope we'd get to see more of Legolas in the coming two movies, which I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE. Viggo Mortensen was dashingly handsome as Aragorn, Sir Ian McKellan radiated gentleness and his Best Supporting SAG award was well-deserved, and the hobbits were excellent. You simply cannot fault the acting, or any other aspects of this movie. I love everything about the film, from its breath-taking sceneries to the grotesque appearances of the orcs to Howard Shore's beautiful music. EVERYTHING! The only -- and I truly mean only -- negative thing I have to say about the trilogy is that they're making me wait an entire year for the next part. It's like feeding me a piece of delicious cake and taking the rest away, and then telling me, ""You'd get the next bite next year."" The cake is lovely, and I want to eat it whole, all at once. And to anyone who wonders why ""FOTR"" is best picture material: it draws you in, it makes you care whether the characters lived or died, and it gets under your skin and refuses to leave until the whole movie is over. It stays in your mind when it's over, and you know you want to go back and relive every moment of that wonderful journey you were a part of. Three times.
All hail ""The Lord of the Rings"".","

"countryway_48864","5 March 2002","I have loved The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and all the writing of Tolkien since the publication of The Lord of the Rings in the '50, when I was in college.  Every one in the dorm was reading it and once I got started I could not stop.Since then, I have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings to my children many time.  Now my oldest son has continued the tradition, reading to his children.When I learned that an attempt was going to be made to use actors and recreate Middle Earth without the use of cartoons, I was both thrilled and nervous.  Could Peter Jackson and his talented group of actors, writers and other creative people REALLY bring this superb story to the screen?I am happy to say, they HAVE!  Every character looks, sounds and acts exactly as I have pictured them all these years.  The ensemble acting is beyond praise.  These actors ARE Gandalf, Strider, Frodo, Sam, Legolas, Merry, Pippen, Galadriel and Arwen et al.I urge all to see this wonderful film!  I can't WAIT for The Two Towers!!","

"j30bell","20 December 2004","If you want to know how to do the impossible, watch Peter Jackson's Fellowship of the Ring. When I was growing up, I thought no one could translate such a sweeping book onto the screen successfully, and yet the man who brought us Bad Taste has done it. Just so you know in advance, the film takes plenty of liberties with the story; no Old Forest, Bombadil, Barrow Wights or Glorfindel. No Wargs in the wilderness - and you have to wait until the third film to see Narsil re-forged. In fact if the film has a serious fault it is that so much of the story is cut, it could leave the audience breathlessly hurtled from one action sequence to another - dazed, and maybe (if you haven't read the book) even a bit confused. But what the film does so successfully is recreated the atmosphere of the story - rather impressive considering the film is shorn of much of the textual richness found in the book. As someone who has read LoTR more times than a man of sound judgement ever should, I found myself more engrossed in the story than I had been for years. The film gets its atmosphere from the scenery, the camera-work and some beautifully adept computer enhancement. In many cases the characterisation was also richer than the original - both Aragorn and Arwen are significantly more ""human"" than in the novel, as is Gandalf. Tolkien's heroes are often to perfect to be truly interesting - after all, in Mallory, it is no co-incidence that Galahad finds the Grail, but two thirds of the book is about Tristan and Lancelot. In Jackson's LoTR we see the human frailties of the characters; Aragorn's self doubt, Gandalf's fear, Elrond's unconcern (basically, ""you deal with it Gandalf, I'm off on holiday with all the other elves""). This is not to say the film is without its flaws. Whoever decided that elves needed...tooo...speak ....sooo.....slowly clearly needs shooting - as does the guy who thought that a WWF-style wrestling match between Gandalf and Saruman was a good idea. Indeed there are a number of moments when a lighter directorial touch would have been better. Galadriel's demon-witch impression, for example, or Gandalf's power-vocalisation at the Bridge of Khazad-Dum. Merry and Pippin have a rather disconcerting resemblance to Ant and Dec (all three films show an astonishing heightism, more of which later). Nevertheless, this film is an enormously impressive attempt do something I though next to impossible. At over three hours it was a long, but thoroughly enjoyable, action/fantasy film; it makes Star Wars looks like the kind of tenth-rate kiddie movie it is. And the best thing is, the special addition is even better. So not perfect, but 8/10 anyway","

"Khwaj","19 March 2002","I don't care what many might think about this, Lord of the Rings rocked me to the ""Beyond"" and back. Powerful visions of the past, epic battles since films like Braveheart, Gladiator and Brotherhood of the Wolf. It packed plenty of punches than a dozen Mike Tyson's put together.Although I hadn't read the books it didn't dissuade me in any way whatsoever to watch this film.Hats off to actors Sir Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee and of course the lovely Sean Bean and Cate Blanchett.
Forget Titanic, this by far is more than just a technical accomplishment or creative input. I really do hope that it sweeps the Academy Awards which it will no doubt do.Birds, beasts, demons this film also very much reminded me of gothic visions of other directors like Dario Argento and the late great Lucio Fulci with there dark brooding imaginations featured in their body of works..  .
For example the scene where Gandalf confronts the gigantic demon was without a doubt the single most spectacular scene that really does shake the very grounds of the film's sequence.I know I might sound like a real boot kissing art fag for liking this film a little too much, but on the other hand the visuals are most definately the single biggest advantage besides the acting as well. I know I also that not reading the book I might sound biased too, but then again it's personal opinions that really matter.I just hope that the follow up (Two Towers) also lives up to what Fellowship of the Rings offered us.Instant classic 10/10","

"lee_eisenberg","21 October 2005","A pop culture phenomenon, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is unlike anything that you've ever seen. The plot of course has several hobbits and humans joining up in Middle Earth to destroy a ring that corrupts whomever possesses it; in the process, they have to fight off evil beings. The movie is beyond impressive. In fact, there isn't any adjective that can do it justice. You have to see it to believe it. Peter Jackson adapted J.R.R. Tolkien's novel to the screen as a work of art that would otherwise be unfathomable. I've never read the novel, but I can say that Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, John Rhys-Davies, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Ian Holm, interpret the characters with a style and quality that we usually associate only with history's most distinguished actors and actresses. This is THE movie to see, and parts 2 and 3 were equally good. A masterpiece in the true sense of the word.","

There's just so much poise and beauty to this movie, even for one that didn't come from a time of great CGI and VFX that we have now. Peter Jackson did an outstanding job with this movie to the most minute detail. Every acting job is done amazingly, and I love every bit of it. One thing I found really interesting was the way humans are portrayed as these greedy people who are hard to manage, compared to such elegant and fun creatures across the Middle Earth. They really make our human conditions shine. From start to finish, there's so many layers of amazing things, and it just brings a smile to my face while watching. The action is sprinkled throughout in a good manner too. I just love Lord of the Rings.","

But I have to say I was amazed - The acting by all concerned is good to excellent especially from Elliah Wood as Frodo & Ian Mckellen as gandalf, The action was well handled & very exciting, The special effects were great but thankfully they didn't distract from the plot (as in MEN IN BLACK 2) The beautiful New Zealand scenery was a joy to watch, and the 3 hours fly by as long as you are prepared to give it a go as it is quite slow to begin with, With the strong characterization of the first 40 minutes. You may be disapointed to see the film end so suddenly as the story follows through 2 more movies, but you'll be thankful you sat down and watched.A future holiday classica must for all adventure/sci-fi fans10/10 just great from start to finish","

I really like a lot of stuff so let's get into it. First I really like how the characters were not a mess or all just feel like they are trying to take the spotlight from one another they all have there own motivation that try to prove themselves and also tried the prove that they are worthy of a good fight, in this movie, Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, are honorable mentions for the best character in his movie but by far the best character in the movie in my opinion is Gandolf he does show that he can give us some tension on what's to come, when I first watched the movie I thought the beginning was going to be boring. Give us some useless information and just drag it out but no it gives us important information on whats to come and what's the come throughout the whole trilogy I can't wait to see what going to happen in these movies because I am into this adventure.

"clowns_n_cookies","18 December 2003","Once every so often in the long history of film, a movie will be made that breaks all boundaries of excellence. In no small way, it captures the eyes, hearts, and imaginations of millions of people around the world, and becomes one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of it's time.Such movies can never be replicated. There is no way you could remake 'Gone With the Wind' and hope to measure it with it's predecessor. There is no way you can retell the first, great 'Star Wars' trilogy and hope to capture the same magic and amazement created all those years ago. (Despite George Lucas's constant efforts to try and make them better... *coughs*)And in the end, there is certainly no way that anyone, in any period of time henceforth, could take J.R.R. Tolkein's classic 'Lord of the Rings' novels and create movies that would dare to rival Peter Jackson's complete cinematic masterpiece.This, my friends, IS the great cinematic masterpiece of our time. There is no replicating. There is no retelling. To call the film perfect is by no means true, but you would definitely have to *reach* perfection if you even dared to capture the brilliance that Jackson has created in his epic trilogy.The landscapes and sets are, to put it shortly, absolutely breath-taking... especially when added to the emotionally stirring score by Howard Shore. The cast is superlative, with each actor completely embodying the characters so perfectly, you'd swear they were born to play them. 'The Fellowship of the Ring', when all is said and done, is arguably the greatest telling of a classic story in movie history. It stirs, it inspires, it saddens, and it overjoys. But most of all, it lingers with you... far longer than you believed it capable of doing.And that, in the end, is what makes it the epic it aspires to be.A masterpiece of its time.","

"neil-476","28 April 2010","As a teenager in the 60s I loved Lord Of The Rings. As years went by I still had a strong affection for it, but I saw more clearly what, to me, were flaws. For instance, the set-piece battle with the Balrog ran to two pages, the Tom Bombadil episode, during which practically nothing nothing of any consequence happened, ran to more than 20! I was always one for story more than texture, as a result of which I began to feel that Tolkien had been in desperate need of an editor who would have helped him strip a flabby 1,100 page book down to a pacey, punchy 500 or so (I'm not keen on reading poems in Elvish, but I appreciate that this is my point of view, not necessarily others').So I went to see part 1 of Jackson's epic adaptation with enthusiasm and trepidation in equal measure.I heartily endorse every editorial decision made by Jackson. Tom Bombadil - gone! As a result, despite 3 hours of running time, part 1 never flags. The story moves constantly with plenty (but not too much) of character set up, back story, and narrative drive.Part 1 deals with the history of the Ring and the beginning of Frodo's journey, to Rivendell in the company of his follow Hobbit and then Aragorn, then through the mines of Moria with the Fellowship, and finally from Lothlorien up to the point where the Fellowship is split apart by an orc attack and Boromir dies.The casting is just absolutely right - every part is perfectly cast. New Zealand, as assisted by CGI tweaks, is Middle Earth. And the pace of the film is also perfect, alternating between excitement, humour, edge of your seat suspense, and interest-filled exposition.Brilliant.","

"ElMaruecan82","20 October 2016","In 2008, the American Film Institute came up with the list of the 10 Greatest American Fantasy Movies of All Time. There was no way ""The Wizard of Oz"" wouldn't top this list but guess which newcomer took the second spot that would have belonged to ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Indeed, Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" is not only the most recent inclusion in any American Film's Institute's List (it is also in the Top 100 Greatest Movies) but it's the highest ranked. It says a lot when a less-than-a-decade old film is literally sandwiched by two classics that are half-centuries older.And 2001 was quite a year for Fantasy; the four highest-grossing movies of the year were the first ""Harry Potter"", ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", ""Monsters & Inc."" and ""Shrek"". And despite that huge competition, it's the cinematic adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien that became an instant classic in the same vein than ""Star Wars"" in 1977. I know ""Harry Potter"" deserves a honorable mention but I don't think the series created something as endearing as ""The Lord of the Rings"" did, a myth, a saga made of characters that are now parts of pop-culture. And if George Lucas has an edge over Jackson because he created his own mythology, Jackson still took up the most difficult challenge ever: recreating J.R.R Tolkien's universe on the screen. The book, the movie, the involvement that made the transition from one format to another possible are all explained in DVD special features, as long as the movie itself, and I watched them with excitement, because nothing is worthier of admiration than an impossible mission being accomplished, starting with the book. Tolkien was a man of classical education, the same generation than Asimov and Pagnol, brilliant literate minds who studied languages, sciences and translated their academic background into art. Tolkien's specialty was language and when he created his world, he didn't just throw names or drew forms; he invented languages, civilizations, that the appeal of Tolkien, his stories felt real, like belonging to humanity's canon.Sure they venture into fairy-tale territories but his creatures are people with specific cultures and lifestyles and even individually, they are not all the same. You have the Elves who are wise, beautiful and immortal, men who are brave but easily corrupted, dwarfs who are practical and rough mine-workers and of course, the friendly Hobbits and their bucolic happiness. The story centers on the most universal myth of all-time, good vs. evil, with one a small object that can destroy the world and yet seems indestructible. Tolkien meant it as an allegory for machinery and its poisoning effect on the world, but the story is told in the classical epic way, featuring the quest of nine heroes, and the journey of a young Hobbit named Frodo.Frodo, played by Elijah Wood, is the film's ""Luke Skywalker"" there's something undoubtedly Obi- Wanesque about the Old Wizard Gandalf, played by Ian McKellen who reveals to Frodo the ring's dark secret, and like Alec Guinness, he was Oscar nominated for his performance, a rarity in Fantasy films. And the performances are integral to the film's success, more than the special effects, more than the production design, the armors and weapons, the Orcs' make-up, the battles' choreographs, if that was enough to make a box-office hit, it takes more to get your three films in IMDb's Top 50, just look at the ""Star Wars"" prequels.Speaking of the performances, Ian McKellen displays a wide range of emotion going from the friendly elderly man, to the warm and reassuring friend with Bilbo Haggings (Ian Holm) but he shows who's the boss when needed to. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin have a great chemistry and you cannot doubt over their friendship and the two other hobbits actors know how to play comic reliefs without going over-the-top. The rest of the cast, from Cate Blanchett to Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn all in their characters, with as much sincerity and intensity as if they were trying to grab an Oscar and that proves one thing, they respect the work of Tolkien. The DVD features show them all being interviewed about their experience and you can see in Mortensen, McKellen and the late Christopher Lee (who plays evil Saruman) that they have a sort of fascination and respect for the Master. And rightfully so, it took Tolkien fourteen years to finish the book, and four times more to make a film out of it. Jackson understood why it took so long when he started making the film. He shot it in New Zealand, the perfect place to recreate Middle-Earth, savage enough to look like it belongs to ancient times, then he recreated Hobbitebourg, and the film took form, step by step. And he shot the three films at once, to maintain the feeling of continuity.Jackson's determination, hard-work is as colossal as Tolkien's creation, what he did was objectively impossible, but he embraced the courage of his hobbits, the wisdom of Gandalf, the strength of Aragorn and went on his own journey, making an epic fantasy, a historical war film, and a coming-of-age story, and if Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" is promised to centuries of fame, the film adaptation will certainly be responsible for it, because that's what makes a myth last, they're translated into different formats, they adapt to their world. And Tolkien's book was begging for a great cinematic adaptation. And Jackson did it. I know there are purists who think the adaptation doesn't do justice to the richness of the book, but the film is still new, give it time. Think of ""The Wizard of Oz"", it was a book, but who can imagine it now without the version of Fleming in mind. Well, in a few decades, ""The Lord of the Rings"" will be as iconic as irreplaceable, maybe it already is.","

"G'aal","23 June 2002","Reading through the various posts, I see that the overriding theme amongst the movie's few detractors was that it was ""overly long"" and ""boring"", even prompting one poster to rename the movie ""Bored of the Rings.""Well, these people clearly haven't read the books and thus are not Tolkien fans.  J.R.R. Tokien's books are VERY long and descriptive, and even the hard core fan has to wade through certain elements.  However, the books are thrilling, sweeping epics, microcosms of the age-old struggles between good and evil.  In this context, Tolkien has created a complete alternate world, populated by humans and similarly-evolved races such as elves, dwarves and hobbits, and mixes courage, determination, love and magic to create ""Middle Earth"".Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring accomplishes what no film maker dared attempt in the 47 years.  It encapsulates the first book of the trilogy in jaw-dropping fashion onto film.  And that bears repeating:  the movie is so amazing, so awe-inspiring, so wondrous that through much of the movie, I felt my jaw literally dropping open.  It's THAT good.The cast is nearly perfect:  Ian McKellan *is* perfect as Gandalf the Grey. The standoff at the Bridge of Khazad-Dum will go down with the alien's tail slowly encircling Lambert in ""Alien"", the initial emergence of the creature from the black lagoon and other horror/fantasy epic moments as one of the all-time great scenes in cinematic history.  Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler, Ian Holm, Cate Blanchett and the rest of the remarkable ensemble cast give the performances of their careers.  The special effects, despite some that claim otherwise, leave the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout.  And the good news is that since the movie has grossed over $800 million world-wide to date, the second and third installments of the trilogy will benefit with post-production special effects improvements.  If you haven't seen this movie, you've missed out, big time, unless you can find it still playing somewhere.  The big screen is far and away the best place to view this masterpiece, especially sitting up close.  I saw it three times in the theaters and would see it again today if it were playing nearby.  And I know where I'll be the day ""The Two Towers"" is released:  in my local theater, sitting close, watching yet another epic bit of storytelling unfold.A gigantic 10 out of 10.","

"pmtelefon","13 December 2020","""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is epic filmmaking at its finest. As part of terrific trilogy, it's great. It's also great as a stand alone film. Co-writer/director Peter Jackson and company hit the ball out of the park with this movie. The movie looks great. It's stunningly beautiful at times. The script takes a dense book and makes it understandable. The cast is also terrific with standout work by Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a long movie that at times feels like it. But when it's ends, it feels like it just started. I remember when I saw this movie in the theater there was a father with his his teen son sitting in front of us. When the movie ended he turned to his son and asked in frustration ""That how it ends?"" (Obviously he didn't understand it was the first installment of three.) I should have told him that yes, that's how a great movie ends.","

"r96sk","16 February 2021","Magnificent! A great start to the franchise.'The Lord of the Rings' is yet another film series that I am incredibly late to viewing, at least I've finally got around to it... albeit almost twenty years on from this film's release.'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is delightful. I never know what to expect from a film that goes on for nearly three hours, the pacing has to be near perfection for it to work - and boy does it here. The run time flew by, which is always a terrific sign.I love a load of things about this, the one that actually sticks out most is the outstanding score. Music can play a huge part in how much I enjoy a film, so I'm delighted to say that the score is here is fantastic. That is by no means the only positive, obviously.The cast are excellent. Elijah Wood gives a strong performance in the lead role. I've seen Wood in others things down the years and have actually found him a bit hit-and-miss, but here he is very good. Elsewhere, I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen's character.Away from those two, there are a whole host of noteworthy cast members. Orlando Bloom, or Will Turner to me, is involved, as are the likes of Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. I also liked Liv Tyler in her role.The look of the film is spectacular, and has aged extremely well even to this day. Everything from the cinematography to the costumes is brilliant, those two things really make the film come alive - helped by the aforementioned score, of course.Very eager to check out the sequels, prequels and, eventually, the upcoming television series.","

"GusherPop","1 September 2022","Peter Jackson adores DVD. He knew going in to his daring translation of Tolkien's fantasy that it wouldn't stop at the cinema. The idea of a finished film can be fluid: scenes excised for valid reasons can be reinstated for home consumption. So, for DVD, not a 'director's cut' replacing the theatrical version, but an alternative extended edit. Put back into the film seamlessly, the extra half-hour of footage doesn't denigrate the original cut, but enhances it like an encore. The tone and story don't change; the journey is deepened, even if the momentum slows. Book-devotees especially will delight in the re-inclusion of Bilbo's voiceover on bucolic Hobbit culture, the extension of Aragorn's backstory, and the small additions on the other members of the Fellowship. If any section feels improved, it is Lothlorien with Cate Blanchett's Galadriel: here we get the famous gift-giving sequence which will prove significant, in the films to come, while the thematic weight of the Elvish decline grows more prominent. Nothing is lost and plenty is gained - this Special Extended Edition DVD is precious indeed. ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" but the Hobbits themselves have been pushed off center stage. If the books are about brave little creatures who enlist powerful men and wizards to help them in a dangerous crusade, the movie is about powerful men and wizards who embark on a dangerous crusade, and take along the Hobbits. That is not true of every scene or episode, but by the end ""Fellowship"" adds up to more of a sword and sorcery epic than a realization of the more naive and guileless vision of J. R. R. Tolkien. The film is remarkably well made. But it does go on, and on, and on--more vistas, more forests, more sounds in the night, more fearsome creatures, more prophecies, more visions, more dire warnings, more close calls, until we realize this sort of thing can continue indefinitely. ""This tale grew in the telling,"" Tolkien tells us in the famous first words of his foreword; it's as if Tolkien, and now Jackson, grew so fond of the journey, they dreaded the destination. Jackson has used modern special effects to great purpose in several shots, especially one where a massive wall of water forms and reforms into the wraiths of charging stallions. I like the way he handles crowds of Orcs in the big battle scenes, wisely knowing that in a film of this kind, realism has to be tempered with a certain fanciful fudging.","

"Vartiainen","12 January 2019","A lot has been said about The Fellowship of the Ring over the years. It was a cultural phenomenon unlike few others at its release. People talked about it for years before it even came out. There was a lot of hype, a lot of buzz. And it earned it. This movie changed cinema. It paved way for a whole plethora of fantasy movies. It's quite likely that the current superhero craze would not have happened had this movie not shown that people cared about make-belief, care about escapism into a foreign and strange world, filled with magic and wonder.It truly is a wonderful movie. There will doubtlessly be other adaptations of J. R. R. Tolkien's magnum opus in the years to come. We can only hope that whoever they end getting to direct, will love the world of Middle-Earth as much as Peter Jackson does.Because that's why these movies are so good, why this movie won us over almost instantly. It's not the huge budget, or the talented actors, or even the majestic landscapes of New Zealand. Although they do help. A lot. But in the end it's the hours put in. All the tiniest details that someone included, not because they absolutely had to, but because they wanted to make it as perfect as possible. Because they care about this world, about this story.The Lord of the Rings has now shaped multiple generations. It has shaped how we think about stories. It's definitely one of my favourite books ever written and this one is definitely one of my favourite movies ever made. Not because it's the perfect adaptation. Or the perfect movie. It's neither. There are things changed, which I wish were not. The storytelling has its hiccups. But those don't matter. Because at its heart this movie is in the right. It cares about what it is, what it represents. About what it's telling us. What kind of a story it is.And it is for that reason that I love this movie so much.","

"Vartiainen","14 September 2015","J. R. R. Tolkien changed literature with his trilogy The Lord of the Rings. A new genre was created practically from nothing. Owing much to fairy tales and epics of old, yet still being something new, fantasy soon captured the imaginations of generation after another. The Lords of the Rings was written as a myth, as an epic, a tale about the struggle against ancient, undying evil. In it great warrior kings and armies of legend fought for the control of Middle-Earth against armies of darkness, filled with hordes of orcs, goblins and trolls. Yet it was a small, insignificant being, a hobbit from the Shire, that would decide their fate through his deeds.Since then this story has influenced pretty much every single author that has come after it. Naturally, a movie adaptation was going to be made at some point, but for the longest time people in the business thought it couldn't be done. You needed to introduce a whole new world, including back stories that could fill whole shelves with books and tomes. The amount of characters alone would make it cumbersome. Without even mentioning the special effects needed. But, finally in the late 90s, movie technology had advanced enough that you could theoretically pull it off. And so Peter Jackson accepted the challenge and in the process created a movie trilogy that affected cinema almost as profoundly as the original book trilogy had affected literature.All three The Lord of the Rings movies are fantastic, but if I had to name my favourite, it'd be this one, no doubt. Not because it's the most direct or has the most flowing narrative. Quite the opposite. The first one contains the most story, has the most detail, jumps around the most. And yet it succeeds in pulling you in. I had read the books numerous times before this movie came out. I knew how much sheer information Jackson had to convey in this first film. I had my doubts. But, the thing is, it's beautiful. From the very first chord of music, from the very first lines of dialogue, from the very first scene of the rings being forged, you're in Middle-Earth. There's just no other way to say it. There's movies capture the essence of Tolkien's original books nigh perfectly.For those that read this and have yet to see this film - yes, all three or four of you - know that this is my second favourite film of all time. It is a fantasy film unlike any other, a tale almost without equal. It is the courage and nobility of men distilled into story form. It is The Lord of the Rings.","

"drqshadow-reviews","12 June 2013","Fellowship of the Ring, Peter Jackson's first swing at J.R.R. Tolkien's daunting mutli-volume masterwork, lands flush on the chin of fans and casuals alike. It's a gorgeous example of just how well a literary adaptation can perform with the right mix of passion, budget, vision and expertise. Jackson's direction, though quite long-winded, seems fat free and balanced with a good sense of when to press forward and when to admire its surroundings. The acting is a relatively broad mix - while Ian McKellen resides comfortably in the quasi-leading role of Gandalf the Grey and Viggo Mortensen is both gallant and inspiring as Aragorn, I found Elijah Wood just a bit too doe-eyed as the ring-bearing hobbit, Frodo. That's nit-picking at its finest though, admittedly, especially given the scene-stealing part played by the realm of Middle Earth itself. Staggeringly realized with an obsessive attention to detail, it's a stern flex of the artistic muscle unlike anything I've seen, before or after. Watching the film today, in the shadow of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is doubly rewarding, as dozens of throwbacks to the events of that film are planted like seedlings throughout the landscape. For my money, this is the best plot of the three LotR volumes, to boot. With one foot planted firmly on the ground and the other teasing the abyss, it covers a gamut of emotions, isn't bashful about shedding important cast members, and gives its audience a sweeping taste of the many colors and flavors present in this world. A wonderful fantasy-adventure hybrid, spiced with action at all the right moments, that does its mythical source material (and the legion of associated fans) proud.","

"Acolyte-2","28 October 2002","The summary above relates to Lord of the Rings, The (1978) which I detested. Peter Jackson did a superb job bringing Tolkien's Middle-earth to the screen. However, I think it's current high rating is seriously premature. This movie cannot stand on its own. Like the book, it's a single continuous narrative split into three parts for reasons of length. Any ending such as it has will not be seen until Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, The (2003) arrives in theaters. Right now it's a work-in-progress. Evaluating it should wait until the entire story is finished.No one who has been a devotee of the book as long as I have can resist comparing the movie against it even though that's not really a valid thing to do across media. So here it goes below. There are POSSIBLE SPOILERS, although they're so highly contextual you probably won't understand them unless you've already seen the movie, so they shouldn't give away much. I don't think I give away any major plot points.What was done right:Rivendell was beatuiful. I used to want a castle someday; now I want the ""Last Homely House"" as Jackson showed it to me.Bree was very well done. Many probably disagree with me about this, but if there wasn't enough time to develop Butterbur as a character, Bree is best shown as a rough-and-tumble waymeet along a road traveled by a large number of highly questionable characters. This is very much like any place so situated would be.Hobbiton. Gorgeous.Casting, for the most part. An exception is noted below. Frodo really should have had brown eyes, but Elijah Wood did a *far* better job than I had anticipated, so it didn't matter.The Council of Elrond. Impossible to shoot as the book has it, but it provided a stark demonstration of the Ring's true power. A highly skillful adaptation.The Mirror of Galadriel. Perhaps the sfx were overdone at a crucial moment, but at least the deep moral import of her choice was preserved and that was the important thing. Hollywood usually glosses over moral issues, or at least the kind of moral issues important to someone like Tolkien.The Balrog. Very frightening and demonic of course, but there's something else. There's a running debate in Tolkien-related newsgroups and BBS as to whether or not it had wings, as Tolkien's own description is very ambiguous. Jackson succeeded in being just as ambiguous visually, thus pleasing (or displeasing) both camps equally. I nearly laughed out loud in the theater when I realized what he'd done.Having cut out all the other supporting characters to simplify the script, the method of Gandalf's rescue was perfectly in character.We see a brief shot of Minas Tirith. Beautiful.And anything else not mentioned below.What was done wrong:The time compression at the beginning. Seventeen years were supposed to have passed between the Party and Gandalf's revelation of the true nature of the Ring. Instead it looked like a year or two at most, and this introduces a plothole. Bilbo's sudden aging was attributed to his putting the Ring aside, but why wasn't Gollum, who'd possessed the Ring for centuries, similarly affected?Arwen's expanded role and Aragorn's mangled motivation. I thought Liv Ullman was just not up to this part. It was expanded at the expense of Aragorn's, Elrond's, and Gandalf's, and she would had to have been extraordinary to satisfy offended book fans. She wasn't. A line was given to Elrond that inexplicably removes a strong motivation for Aragorn to fulfill his heritage, whereas in the book it was a condition that he himself imposed before he would consent to their relationship. Since it would have enhanced both the romance and the adventure, why not leave it as it was?Moria. The entire complex was supposed to have been a thriving city in the past, so what's with the impossibly steep staircases and the unrailed bridges over yawning abysses? It couldn't possibly have functioned. Even populated by Dwarves they would have lost a dozen or so pedestrians a day, and it dilutes the effect of the *one* unrailed bridge over a yawning abyss (part of Moria's defenses) near the exit.Gimli. John Rhys-Davies has a wonderfully mobile face and a marvellous voice. Both were buried under so much latex and fake hair as to be useless. The actor was completely wasted here to the detriment of the character.Blond elves? Who says?Saruman's expanded role during the mountain crossing. The Fellowship was defeated by a malevolent nature spirit responding to Sauron's growing will, *not* a cranky wizard several hundred miles away acting at that moment for no reason we can perceive.Mostly, this is just the kind of nitpicky stuff a geek like me would pick up on. If you've never read the book, it won't bother you at all. No one who has not read the book who saw this movie that I asked even noticed, and all enjoyed it immensely. Go see it.","

"Paok-Kilkis","12 January 2020","I consider The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring not only the best LOTR movie but the best film of all time. The movie has much better cohesion from the sequels. It also has a far more organized screenplay. The story begins with two heroes, who later became four, then five, then nine and then the journey begins. The dangers are so many you need to hold your breath. There are deadly mountains, thunders, the mines of Moria, a place that has been held by the enemy, monsters, a sword-wielding fire demon called Balrog, Galadriel the Argonath, the death of some members and the break of the fellowship. I like that the heroes are all together instead of the sequels who are seperated. Also the movie has the greatest leitmotif in cinema's history. Every character, place and race has a theme of it's own. You hardly grasp the importance of music in film. It's an invisible layer of pure emotion that guides us or challenge us, or guides or challenges the drama itself. One other thing that this movie has and the other two don't is Sean Bean's character, Boromir which I find the most intresting character of the trilogy. His character in the end finds redemption and in my eyes it's the most heroic death I have ever seen. The ending is heartbreaking and it's surely one to remember. The movie's shooting began in 1999 and the CGI are better from movies like The Hobbit trilogy which is made almost 15 years later. That proves that practical effects are better that computers. It's been 20 years since 2001 and this trilogy has age perfectly. It's wthout a doupt the greatest fantasy movies of all time and no matter how many years will pass these movies will not been forgotten.","

"RonellSowes","8 June 2022","I think it's impossible and actually pointless to try and view The Fellowship of the Ring or any of The Lord of the Rings films as individual movies: they're a collective achievement. And what you can say about one mostly applies to all.How these films did so much so well from the almost perfect casting to visual and special effects and most aspects from the broadest down to the more minor details were done correctly with only a few exceptions. Naturally, most of this is thanks to Peter Jackson who outside of the trilogy might not be that good of a director but his job here is excellent.The Lord of the Rings thrill and they think, they exceed as entertainment and cinema and will probably continue to hold their well-earned status for years to come.","

One of the biggest films of all time, and a tragedy that the boffoons at the Academy voted snoozathon A Beautiful Mind as best film. Yes it was OK but really how many times have we seen movies similar to that?Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring, had everything one could wish for. Top notch acting, a dramatic storyline, superb cinematography, Stunning landscapes and a classic soundtrack!Some reviewers have stated it is too long. I say it's not long enough and I could have quite happily have sat in the theatre for another hour no problem.I also noticed that many people have voted this film a 1. IMDb should have another top film table, minus the silly ""1"" votes. This film could never, ever be a one in anyones imagination.I, like many here, have read and loved the books. Watching the movie we see the images that were conjured up in our minds when reading the books. So many have said its exactly what they imagined it's almost uncanny but fantastic to behold. I totally agree.As for a lot of the doubters saying its not a patch on The Godfather, Shawshank, etc, well they wouldn't know whan a real classic came along to join these great movies. Yes, Godfather is a good movie, Shawshank is a good movie (though in my opinion slightly overated) But LOTR is the fantasy classic of our time. 20 years from now LOTR will have earned itself the status of classic fantasy adventure, with virtually no doubter whatsoever, a landmark that other films will strive, and mostly fail to achieve.Thank you Peter Jackson for bringing Middle-earth to life for so many of us grateful fans. Personally I can't wait for the extended DVD, with the extra 30 minutes of unseen footage, which arrives in November.cheers","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","16 November 2016","The Fellowship of the Ring is the starting point for the now classic Lord of the Rings film trilogy, and while aspects of the movies haven't aged too well (like the rubbery CGI rag-doll stunt effects), they're still joys to watch and you are truly in Middle-earth. Peter Jackson brings his bombastic and theatrical sensibilities with these movies and his direction brings something from across the emotional spectrum of many different cinematic genres; and the experience works so well.For any lover of Tolkien, such as myself, it's notable and incredibly obvious when Jackson takes creative liberties; but the changes from the novels are necessary. In spite of some of the inevitable changes when making the movies, they play out fine in the end: the changes add nice drama to the story and there's still nice visual subtlety in the performances from the magnificent cast of Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Viggo Mortensen, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies.The film is full of classic moments like the Mines of Moria sequence, the Lothlórien scenes and of course the good-old Shire: the locations of the Baggins of Bag End. There are so many remarkable things in this movie. Everything right down to the music is well done here and adds to one of the most well-realized fantasy film settings in history.I'd want to thank Peter Jackson personally for giving us the three movies of his fantastical magnum opus based on one of the greatest novels of our time.","

"Agent10","21 May 2002","Epics aren't easy to make, but Peter Jackson created a masterpiece of a film. This movie will easily detract all of the failed efforts he has engaged in, especially the god-awful The Frighteners. While Star Wars may be considered the superior series and Harry Potter the more popular of the fantasy epics, LOTR's depth and more subtle use of CGI effects proves to be far superior to the saturated blue-screens and matte paintings Star Wars and Harry Potter employ. I never took Elijah Wood seriously as an actor, nor Sean Astin. I was very apprehensive about these two being in this movie, but those fears were quickly alleviated when I witnessed the seemingly natural friendship the two displayed in the movie. Maybe that is why New Line made all of the movies at once. Eventually, friendships had to form in this type of setting, and such ideals would become rather convenient throughout the scope of the story. This is by far a good beginning, and fans of the books (like myself) won't be subjected to inconsistencies and older looking actors considering all of the principal photography is finalized. Which leads to one question. What kind of money would one get having to be the film clerk for this trilogy?","

"lambiepie-2","28 November 2002","How I wish I could have seen THIS film first. I had no interest whatsoever in The Lord of the Rings books. Let's be honest, when its required reading in literature class and the teacher made middle earth seem as dry as a chip, who would have an interest?Well, this film made me have an interest and want to go back and read the books again. This production was lavishly and handsomely done. I was excited, thrilled, scared at points, cheering, laughing and just caught up in the wonder of this production. There isn't ONE character I didn't like, there wasn't ONE moment I wasn't interested. There is so much I can explain about the film, but for my review, I just want to comment on how it effected me as an ex-student assigned to read a book I though was horrid, and seeing it decades later as a wonderful adaptation that I watched over 100 times by now.Here's another film I did NOT go to the movie house to see and yes, I am kicking my own butt for not doing so. I missed a great film on wide screen, and just to let everyone know, I am in line for ""The Two Towers"" already.Granted, this will not help my ""C"" grade I got when I was assigned to read it back in the day, but I love his film to death. I just bought the expanded DVD, and now I am a Lord of the Rings fan for life!Future LOTR literature teachers, take note! Then make sure your students get to see the film as a companion piece to the books...believe you me, they'll thank you later with plenty of interest.","

But I am glad they waited so long to make it, as the result is an absolute masterpiece that will satisfy even the most hardcore Tolkien fans.","

"miguelneto-74936","19 September 2016","when Peter Jackson decided to adapt the tales of Tolkien master, the greatest work of history of fantasy, The Lord of The Rings, I believe that many were with a behind foot, who would say that this work could be adapted more Peter Jackson adapts brilliantly Peter hit full in the choice of casting, Elijah Wood is his best role in his career, Sean Astin this great, Ian McKellen dispenses comments, impeccable as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm, Baker Hall, John Rhys-Davies, Sean Bean, Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, and etc., the cast is spectacular, and the acting is much of great, the special effects are incredible, even more epoch that was released, the picture is beautiful, the film adapts well to land-media, the costumes are incredible, the opening scene of the film is one of the best of film history, which explains everything we know about the rings, the battle scenes are impeccable, the characters are great, my favorites are Smaug (which appears little longer appears in the next film), Gandalf, Aragorn, Sean and Legolas., the film is over, spend more flying, the pace is very good, and the script even with some problems, is very good, the Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring is the beginning of a trilogy that had been in the film history.

"Victor Field","30 December 2001","Many people have expressed their fondness for this first part of the trilogy already, so I'll devote this brief review to discussing the flaws of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.""Flaw 1: Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. In amongst an otherwise fine cast, she's the only one of the principals who seems to not believe where she is; her performance suggests she thinks she's in a perfume commercial (you almost expect her to say ""Obsession. Calvin Klein""), and the soft-focus of her scenes only underlines that impression.Flaw 2: IT ENDS!Sam supplies the best possible review: ""Well, that was an eye-opener."" New Line has a great Christmas 2002 present lined up for us...","

"KGersen","17 April 2002","First things first - I've read LOTR probably 3/4 times. & the Silmarillion and bits of the Unfinished Tales and yadda yadda yadda....I however have grown up enough to know that LOTR (the book) is for many a great novel because it relates to when they first read it...it is great within it's context but not the greatest book ever or any of that tosh...IMHO all lists are bunkum anyway.So having got that off my chest, here is another confession....I was worried, very, very worried about LOTR on the big screen. Would it be a 'Krull', a 'Willow', a 'Beastmaster', a.........urgh,,,Dungeons & Dragons? You know what I mean...fantasy is damn hard to do. The Tolkien imitators that plague the bookshelves prove this as do the whole stackfull of cheesy, hammy fantasy movies with cheesy, hammy names chasing after magical McWidgets to save the nation / planet / galaxy / universe from eternal damnation. I had prepared a crushing hex for Peter Jackson if he inflicted this fate upon LOTR.But there was a sign of hope, like Glamdring's pale fire in the smoke and flames of the Balrog (er, enough of that) - 3 films. Not 1 mish-mashed jampacked farce-fest. No, 3 full-length films giving the book's epic scale a chance to work it's wonder on the filmgoers.Well Peter Jackson pulled it off - by resolutely avoiding the 'big-name' actors, by insisting on New Zealand for filming, by used WETA for effects, by nipping & tucking the story where required (I suspect even Jackson could not have kept Tom Bombadil from looking like total clown), by expanding where needed (another writer is very correct that Arwen's importance is only clear in the book during the Appendix).If you don't like fantasy one little bit...which makes me wonder where exactly your imagination resides....then even with this appalling handicap LOTR 'Fellowship of the Ring' can still enthrall you. If you love the book, the film still does the trick. If you just like being contrary for the sake of it then I guess you won't like this film. But then I doubt you like much else in life either.","

"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","5 June 2004","I was so happy when I saw this. It is proof that Hollywood can spend huge budgets and not always produce bad movies! They need to hire a director who's not from Hollywood, but they can still do it!This is a great adaptation of the first book of the LOTR trilogy with not too much deviation. The cinematography and sets are particularly amazing. They truly capture Tolkien's rich language and vivid detail from the book. All the lush visuals are beautifully rendered in what is one of the few good uses of extensive CGI.The non-CGI elements like the costumes and music are also breathtaking. The people who worked on this worked their butts off many times and they deserve all the praise they have gotten and will surely receive for the rest of their careers in film. 10/10","

"singedelopera","6 July 2002","The more and more one thinks of it, the more one reads Tolkien and appreciates it, the more and more brilliant this movie becomes.  Unlike Harry Potter, whose scenes were completely stripped from the book and had no imagination of its own (not to mention details that were changed for no good reason), this work not only has a soul of its own, but manages to keep with Tolkien's original work...  I love this film! Tis Brilliance!
A word on Casting: perfect. My only qualm is that Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) was a little iffy.  Tolkien makes it a very clear that there is no evil in Galadriel or Lothlorien, but the audience never really gets this as we are all wondering if her skin is going to shed violently to reveal a hideous monster in the service of Sauron.  Nothing to depreciate the value that is this film though.  The emotional range is perfect, the quirkiness of the hobbits is perfect, the cast of characters is perfect... I LOVE YOU PETER! Now it is up to them not to ruin the next two.  As Peter has done so well with the first one, however, I don't see how he or his writing team could. 10/10","

"EijnarAmadeus","19 November 2002","...that was maybe too much! But, I do got to say: one of the best movies ever made!Elijah Wood is wonderful as Frodo Baggins, the confused, scared but brave little fellow. Then we got this Strider guy, Aragorn. Viggo Mortensen plays him supreme and is probably the movies best character, and we've got Sean Bean as Boromir, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, Liv Tylor as Arwen, Ian MacKellen as Gandalv and we can go on and on.The film music is one of the best I've ever heard! Especially after Gandalv has died - very mood."" Run you fools!

"Boba_Fett1138","28 June 2003","Beautiful environments with lovely costumes combined with superb characters and and an intense story...the result: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.Don't let the 3 hour + running time scare you of, like so many long movies it's very well worth seeing. Never has a fantasy world looked so realistic as in Lord of the Rings. All the sets are very detailed and have a realistic feeling as well as the characters and the different races of Middle Earth.The greatest strength of this movie is not the story itself. The story itself is actually pretty simple, basically it's just about the Ring and the quest to destroy it. No, the greatest strength are the characters, the look of Middle Earth and the action sequences. Rarely has an adventure movie looked so good and has been so tense and enjoyable to watch.But let's not over praise it, the movie has it flaws and weak spots. There are some unnecessary and boring scene's (especially in the Extended Edition) but for an 3 hour + movie that's maybe just unavoidable. And no matter how awesome everything looks, the special effects aren't always top-class, I'm a firm believer that the movie would have been better if ILM provided the special effects. But let's not judge the movie for what it could have been but let's judge it for what it is. Also, sometimes the Hobbits (Sam, Pippin and Merry) are border line irritating. Another thing that disturbed me was the editing, in my opinion it was extremely bad done in some of the scene's (For instance in the wizards battle between Gandalf and Saruman) but having some editing experience myself I might pay extra attention to this things...But in this case all those flaws and weak spots are forgiven, for The Fellowship of the Ring truly is a wonderful movie that you simply must have seen at least once in your life.Already a classic!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"marcusedenellis","30 July 2005","If you are reading this review (or indeed any other) trying to assess whether or not you should watch this film then please read no further and just go and slip in the DVD (Extended Version) and let the sights and sounds of Middle Earth wash over you. Nothing I, or indeed anyone else, can say should help you to form an opinion prior to watching. I guess the audience for the three films fall into two distinct categories; those who have read the books and those who have not. Those who have not, in my experience, tend to be overwhelmed by the absolute majesty of the vision but a little non-plussed by the actual story - seeing it as just some rather dopey fantasy; a Star Wars trilogy set in past times for the modern audience if you like. Then there is the ""yes, I have read the books"" class who in general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments such as ""they left out too much"", ""its not what I imagined"" or ""Of course its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich"".Tolkein bemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he sought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too humble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic backdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the languages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed down over many generations. Peter Jackson and his team must be congratulated not only for their wonderful realisation of Middle Eath and its inhabitants; but for crafting a series a movies that captured the very essence of what Tolkein was trying to achieve.Well done also for leaving out Tom Bombadil.","

"meydiana-65242","7 July 2022","The Fellowship of the Ring is one of those films that comes once in a lifetime, how fortunate we are as human beings to be around at a time where 3 of these films are released within 3 short years!!The fellowship is just the perfect blend of setting the story, fleshing out characters and introducing us to the world of middle earth!Ian McKellen as Gandalf is just legendary.... mysterious, loveable, occasionally hilarious and in THAT iconic scene, completely immortalised.Elijah wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd showcase perfectly not only their playful naivety and innocence but a good heart along with their fierce will and courage to do whatever it takes.Sean Bean does what he does best in most films but has never upset as more in this case and whilst doing so shows us both the best and worst qualities of humans in the harsh, hostile but magical world of Middle earth.By the end of the film you're dying to see what happens next and at every turn you get both attention to detail and storytelling that is seldom found elsewhere.If you haven't watched the Fellowship of the Ring yet, I beg of you! Do it!! It's the first film of a trilogy that is so close to perfection that it will only be seen once in a lifetime 🏅","

"Doddi","16 February 2002","I am one of few who openly admits his favourite movies are Edward Scissorhands and Titanic, but before seeing Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring (abbr. FOTR) I knew I was going to see something unique.But nothing prepared me for this: jawdropping sets and special effects, details that are almost on the verge of sanity (!) and brilliant costumes and make-up. To have such a blend with amazing cast and director... is a delight. Peter Jackson has performed a miracle. He's taken the most popular novel of 20th century, defied the pessimists, stood tall in his shorts and turned it into the greatest movie I've ever seen. I tell you, everything in the film was ""perfect"". Nothing less.The script must have been difficult to write but it has been done so well here. Peter Jackson has also managed to get a cast that is known but not really ""super-star"", and they are perfectly cast in their roles. Fate brought Viggo Mortensen into the role of Aragorn (I can't see how Stuart Townsend was chosen) and I've never seen an actor live into the character so much. Ian McKellen IS Gandalf, so no contest and hand him the Oscar, thank you. The hobbits are wonderful and especially well portrayed, led by Elijah Wood, the story's small hero. Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett are heavenly and Tyler even surprised me with good accent and acting. So did Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee and that newcomer Orlando Bloom.Added to this is the mythic and wonderful music from Howard Shore. I love it and it brings me everytime to the emotional highs and lows of the film and I see the sorrow, the faces and my heart cries out. It's a powerful film, with marvellous acting and music and sets..., directed flawlessly by soon-to-become-my-favourite-director Peter Jackson. At the end I can only say that I thank each and everyone involved with this movie because I felt better as a person after seeing it, and I'm always thankful for a perfect time. FOTR is indeed perfect!","

"Badmoviessuck","25 November 2018","This movie is good actually.
It's and enjoyable fantasy adventure that will give you a fun ride.
It has some pacing issues at the beginning of the movie but after like 1 hour or so the movie get's better with it's pacing.
The action is well done and i enjoyed it throughout the movie.
But there is this one problem with the movie which i will talk about.CHARACTERS
The characters are very weak.
Frodo is a weak protagonist, Sam is barely there in the movie. Mary and Pippin are weak characters and pretty much all of the gang are weakly written.
But i'll give it the benefit of the doubt that they will be developed on the second and third movie and this movie had clearly story driven characters cause Frodo is kind of a passive character.
Frodo made about two choices in the movie.
The first one that starts the adventure, that choice was so that he could survive and that the world would go under and that gandalf told him to make that choice.
The second one was Frodo decided all by himself but the rest of the movie Frodo and all the other characters are let stuff happen to them which makes them passive.
It's nothing wrong with that and they could do alot to change that anyways but they should have atleast gave all the characters a little more depth not a lot but just a little.
And i think Frodo should have somewhat changed in the first movie like for example he is going a little bit more crazy cause of the ring but i believe that they would keep that in the sequel and i am sure that the sequel is going to be better than the first one.VERDICT
Overall a solid movie with some problems but they aren't major problems and i recommend this movie","

"johnnymonsarrat","8 March 2002","Like many fans of the book, I walked into LOTR mentally praying ""please, if there is a God, don't let them screw this up.""They didn't. The movie is flawless; perfect, and pays tribute worthy of the original book. Acting, visuals, directions, perfect.If you normally don't care much for fantasy, but might be persuaded to see one, just one movie with ""elves"" and such, this is the one.One note, however -- check your watch when the movie starts so you will know when the ending is coming up. That way you won't get caught out in a couple of places where it ""feels"" like the movie might end at any moment. It is long, so be ready for that.","

"OneRingToRuleThemAll13","15 November 2011","First I must begin by telling you that I did not read the books of the same name that this movie is based on until this year actually, and I first saw this film shortly before the second entry came out in the theaters, so you shouldn't have any problem with watching this film, or any of the other two that showcase the next two books in the series (The Two Towers and The Return of the King), and will your enjoyment of the books after watching the films will diminish only slightly (if at all) because you already know the plot. This film begins the tale of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), a young ''hobbit'' (creatures thought of originally by the books' sadly long- dead author, J.R.R Tolkien), whose caretaker Bilbo (Ian Holm) who took him in after his parents died, makes up his mind and leaves for a one- way trip to Rivendell, land of the elves which is ruled by Elrond (Hugo Weaving, and leaves to Frodo the ''One Ring'', creation of the Dark Lord Sauron before his demise. Frodo learns from the wizard Gandalf (played pitch-perfect by Ian Mckellen), that the Ring is evil, and is the reason why Bilbo has reached the age of 111, due to the ability of the Ring which gives you immortality. He also tells him that part of the malice of Sauron's spirit lived on in the Ring long after he died, giving the Ring a mind of his own and a desperate desire to return to the hand of his master. Bilbo found the ring when he fell into Gollum's (motion- capture genius Andy Serkis) cave, and took it from the ground. Gollum, who had possessed it for a very long time, was deformed and driven mad by the Ring. Gandalf gives Frodo the task of taking it to the village of Bree, and later on to Rivendell, where he forges a pact with Gandalf, Sam (his dear gardener, played by Sean Astin), Merry and Pippin, hobbits and old friends of Frodo (played by Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd, respectively), Aragorn and Boromir (both of the race of Men), Legolas the Elf, and the dwarf Gimli, to carry the Ring to Mount Doom in Mordor, Sauron's domain, to destroy the evil Ring, for the sake of Middle-Earth, (the setting of the books and films).The acting here is top-notch, with special notice given to Ian Mckellen, Elijah Wood, and Sean Astin as Sam. (who gives it his all) Sam (as many other readers and movie buffs alike, moi included), is the true main character of the films and books(you'll see why in next installments).The pacing is perfect, I never get bored while watching (and, believe me I have seen this film THOUSANDS OF TIMES!).The music is one of the best around (composed, orchestrated, conducted, and produced by Howard Shore), and will keep you humming, excited or at the edge of your seat whenever the occasion warrants it.However, the most incredible part of this film series is the ability for the film crew to bring to life the beautiful and exciting locales of the book series. Filmed in New Zealand, The Lord of the Rings is beautiful. Also among the chief reason for LOTR rabid fans to watch this is how they only strayed from the plot of the book in minor details (at least in this one), and stayed true to the core spirit and heart of the books. The most epic parts of the books are still here and are sometimes even better (for example, the sequence of The Bridge of Khazad Dúm is seriously the most epic thing I have ever seen in any film :P), while sometimes I feel they didn't unleash some parts' true potential (yes, I am imagining you, Lothlorien >.>). If you haven't yet seen Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, and you are a fan of the books, please do yourself a favor and rent this right away (after you've seen the theatrical version, you might be interested in the EXTENDED edition of this, which is one of the rare cases in which the extended version is actually BETTER that the original). IF you haven't read the books and you are just looking for an epic fantasy or action film, then by all means, sink your teeth into this an enjoy! I guarantee you will thank me later ;)*NOTE: I will be posting a review for The Two Towers and also another for The Return of the King shortly. Please, check back tomorrow or in the near future*","

"LoneWolfAndCub","14 October 2005","When Peter Jackson took on this amazing trilogy written by J.R.R Tolkien he was taking one of the biggest dares in cinematic history. The Lord of the Rings trilogy has gathered countless fans over the world. The books are captivating masterpieces that delve deep into our imaginations. To think that it would be transferred to the big screen. But Peter Jackson had that certain touch, he turned a great book into a film that will be treasured as one of the greatest films to ever have been made.For those who haven't read the books (I urge you to) the plot focuses on a ring. A ring made for evil. This ring can turn the bearer invisible at will. By luck, this ring lands into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit from The Shire. He passes it down to his nephew Frodo Baggins. When Gandalf finds out about this he immediately sends Frodo on a quest to destroy The One Ring. Because if it falls into the wrong hands it could mean an end the Middle Earth. Along with Samwise Gamgee they set off on an epic adventure.This movie is one-of-a-kind. An adaption has never been this good. Everything about this movie is captivating and just so brilliant. I have read the Fellowship just once but I was just so pleased with this movie. The way Peter Jackson has gone from paper-to-film is very inspiring. The look of Middle Earth is extremely beautiful. The beautiful Hobbiton and dread-filled Mordor are just perfect.The roles are perfectly suited. Elijah Wood is great as Frodo, Sean Astin as Samwise was a perfect choice and Ian McKellen as Gandalf was an extremely smart choice. This movie is just perfect and if you haven't seen it I urge now. GO SEE IT!! 5/5.","

"RatBoy1323","7 August 2003","This film is a triumph in almost every aspect.  I had never read the books upon seeing the film and was a little sceptical about what many people were claiming that it would change the way films were made.  Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has become my favorite movie of all time.  And I have seen a lot of freaking movies.Every aspect of the film works.  The cast works their respective roles to perfection with Ian McKellen(Gandalf), Elijah Wood(Frodo), Viggo Mortensen(Aragorn), Sean Bean(Boromir), and Sean Astin(Sam) being the standouts.  From the epic prologue of the film you realize that there is a great, epic journey ahead of you.  And along the way you meet and care for every single character in the film.Director Peter Jackson has really crafted a beautiful piece of work that will be remembered for ages.  It's a perfect balance of action and great character moments.  Character development is not sacrificed for more action like so many other films of its like.  There are many moments of the film that make you realize this is more than just your typical fantasy film, moments that transcend filmmaking and have a profound effect on you. The last 30 minutes are particularly powerful and moving.Basically, this film is an epic, incredible experience.  A film that will be looked at years down the road as a great piece of filmmaking.  If you're a fan of good fantasy, or if you're just a fan of great movies, you'll love this film, plain and simple.","

"jameskortar","20 October 2014","This is one of the few movies I've seen that does justice to the book it represents. True, it doesn't follow the story exactly, but Peter Jackson did about as good a job as you can expect anyone to do in three hours. This movie is incredible. There simply is nothing to complain about. The acting is superb, with several cast members giving the performance of a lifetime. The special effects are breathtaking, and the stunts and fight scenes very memorable. This film captivates you from the very start, when it tells the story of the rings, and holds you until the last moment, where we are left to wonder about the fate of the scattered fellowship (well, those who never read the books, at least). I knew this film was a masterpiece when my wife, who hates the fantasy genre, insisted on seeing it 3 times in theaters. This movie is the best! i highly recommend it for anyone but small children. the battle scenes are great. Elijah Wood was once more playing the innocent hobbit on a journey. There is nothing but pure perfection in this film, and doubtless it will become as classic and legendary as the book that inspired it.","

"alexpeychev","18 January 2021","Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.Now, several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.Anyway, ""Fellowship,"" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.","

"RahulM007","23 February 2023","""One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.""""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is an exhilarating and unforgettable start to a three-part adventure series. Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the most universally acclaimed projects in the world. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the long-running franchise. It mainly focuses on establishing the setting, mythological figures, places emphasis on worldbuilding, and sets up the next two films in the trilogy. The story primarily follows Frodo Baggins as he tries to resist the power of the ring and to not succumb to the dark side. Smeagol aka Gollum is the ringmaster, while Frodo Baggins is the ring-bearer. The ring was forged by the dark lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. The ring grants immortality, but it also unlocks your deepest darkest desires and lowers one's inhibitions. Even though he is the protagonist, Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins is the blandest character introduced in the film. The inclusion of non-diegetic music enhances the tension and suspense of the scenes in the film like Gandalf's unfortunate demise. Peter Jackson manages to precisely capture the beauty of Middle Earth and the subtleties of the mythological figures represented in the film. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is an ambitiously crafted epic fantasy with stunning imagery, memorable characters, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences, a gripping narrative, a powerful score, and magnificent costumes and set design. Peter Jackson's craftsmanship and sheer level of detail is incredible and left me in awe.Memorable lines:""Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.""""Embrace the power of the ring or embrace your own destruction.""""There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only one who can bend it to his will. And he does not share power.""""You shall not pass.""""To bear a ring of power is to be alone.""""Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.""Final verdict: 8.5/10.","

Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is an electrifying eye candy feast, courtsey of director Peter Jackson and writers.The story itself isn't too hard to understand as a hobbit, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) inherits a mysterious ring from a close relative, Bilbo (Ian Holm) and unfortunately finds out who it belonged to before. So Frodo is forced to take the ring back to where it came from and he's helped from a wide (and unlikely assortment) of allies who become known as ""the Fellowship"".Besides the story, another element of the movie made me enjoy even more is the cast, which has to be one of the best ones ever assembled in several decades. Among the other key characters are Gandalf (Ian McKellan), a wizard: two humans, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) and Boromir (Sean Bean): Legolas (Orlando Bloom), a wise elf with excellent marksmanship: Gimili (John Rhys-Davies), an axe-wielding dwarf with a grudge: and three other hobbits (Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, and Dominic Monhagan) who make up the ""Fellowship"". There's some other familiar faces that appear here (Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, and Christopher Lee) who each play a key role here.Overall, the movie is bound to be a classic even though it moves at a leisurely pace and gives the viewer time to understand the characters more especially Frodo, Gandalf, and Aragorn - each of whom seem to be bothered by something in their past.One last thing, since I haven't seen ""A Beautiful Mind"" yet I'm sure this movie truly deserved ""Best Picture"" and I say it not insult the die hard fans of the series.","

"calspers","31 March 2020","""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001) is such a definitive adventure, perfectly realised through the intention of Peter Jackson.The truly awe-inspiring production design, the perfect casting of everyone from Elijah Wood to Ian McKellen, the haunting score by Howard Shore, the perfect editing (in both versions, in my opinion). It is simply a work of art, and perfectly realised.But what to me is the most beautiful message of Tolkien's masterpiece delivered for the screen by Jackson is the symbolism in the world of Middle Earth. The ring is perhaps the purest ever depiction of the fragility of the human condition. Our search for power, influence and the ego. At the same time, the way in which love is portrayed by Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, and perhaps most of all Sam, is daringly beautiful - in fact all Tolkien's caricatures of Christ.A definitive statement - not only for the fantasy genre - but one which has cemented itself in cinema history.","

"raematti","9 February 2022","I was born in 1999. This trilogy came out in 2001, 2002, & 2003.I had older brothers who saw these in theaters (jealous)! They got them on vhs tape and watched them every weekend while babysitting me while our parents worked.By the time I was 5 (2004), I had seen this trilogy many times. After we'd watch them, we played the PS2 video games. Fun memories.As time went on, my brothers got into trouble. Ironic how the films they introduced me to helped me through the tough times that they caused.I am grateful to them for only that. Without LOTR, I don't know where I'd be. The strength of these beautiful characters has helped me persevere. Tolkien was a genius! I've read almost the whole trilogy. And played the games countless times.Peter Jackson is as genius as Tolkien. You can tell he really took his time to honor this man's unique universe. The excellent casting, costuming, wigs, props, EVERYTHING!The fact that the actors had to learn to speak properly, and speak Elvish. And how to do combat.From what I remember, there are hardly any differences between book and film. And those that are, are understandable.Jackson did Tolkien justice. If anyone tries to recreate this trilogy, I WILL riot.I'm going to devote a whole paragraph to the music. Howard Shore was a gamble considering he'd never done anything like this before. But did Jackson win big with that gamble!The music is one of THE most memorable film scores out there! You hear it and you know it. That's the sign of a talented musician. Even my mom knows the music and can even respect the material. And she doesn't like fantasy.I adore all the detail put into these cinematic masterpieces that still don't look dated. The voice acting, cgi and green screen blend so well into what's real, you find yourself in the real world looking around in disbelief that an Ent isn't outside your door!Thank you Peter Jackson! Thank you crew! Thank you cast! Thank you Howard Shore! And especially thank you to J. R. R. Tolkien. May your memory and universe live on forever!","

Words don't come easy when I try to describe the impressive beauties of an epic legend turned into images. The enormous task of adapting the film is superb, with and outstanding plot, a perfect direction and a very well chosen casting of actors! Is is a film that fills and overwhelms all I had imagined when I read the book. There is few films than for me, deserve a 10, if I could, for this one, I would give a 12 to it!!! Emotion, action, love, passion, tragedy, greed... All the most touching emotions of our world moved into an fantastic and moving world filled with strange creatures that will, of course, make you stay 4 hours (yeah, 4!, so big is the greatness of the film!) in your sofa, absolutely amazed and desiring to know how continues. Peter Jackson (the director), must have been inspired by God to do such a perfect film!","

"general-melchett","21 November 2006","I have watched this film 80 times (no lie) - I have enjoyed it every time. Peter Jackson has brought Middle-Earth to the screen brilliantly and with glory - New Zealand's beautiful scenery and huge mountains recapture Tolkien's world in a way that would make him proud. On top of that, every actor owns his/her role 100% (especially Aragorn, Frodo and Gandalf) and delivers very powerful, meaningful performances that ensure that every character has their own story to tell (and their own movie to act). Though some of the battle scenes aren't great - there is obvious ragdoll usage in the troll fight scene - this film is a stunning start to the most successful trilogy of the millennium and a chance to experience Tolkien's world on screen for yourself as it always should have been - flawless. A must-see. 10/10","

"sandnair87","11 January 2016","The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a spectacle with the emotional charge of a thunderbolt on a canvas brushed with master strokes. With authority and disarming creative propensity, director Peter Jackson creates mystic illusions borne from J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novel. The result is a marvelous journey, where gentle hobbits, powerful wizards and humans meld with trolls, misshapen orcs, black-cloaked ring-wraiths and Uruk-Hai.In the first chapter The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the magical land of Middle-earth is the fictional setting, but it's no backdrop; it's a living, breathing universe, in which mild-mannered hobbit Frodo Baggins (a brilliant Elijah Wood) is forced to turn hero when he inherits the ring of absolute power - the one that grants long life, invisibility and carries with it the inevitable seduction of evil. Assisted by powerful wizard Gandalf (a perfectly cast Ian McKellen) and a motley fellowship of warriors, he must journey across Middle Earth to return the talisman to its source. Frodo's entourage includes the brooding but valiant ranger Aragorn (a mesmerizing Viggo Mortensen), the scheming but brave Boromir (Sean Bean) and the dashing elfin archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Also along for the adventure are three of Frodo's mischief-making hobbit chums from the Shire. Frodo sets out with this coterie on an epic quest to carry the ring into the core of the vanquished dark lord Sauron's lair, who has been hot on the hunt, to destroy it in the searing fires of Mount Doom.Their journey is fraught with adventure, as the fellowship does extensive battle with all sorts of rogues along the way. Orchestrating all the evil-doing is the fallen wizard Saruman (a marvelously malevolent Christopher Lee), who has gone over to the dark side and battles wits with the cagey old Gandalf. All along the way, there's plenty of soul-searching as Frodo questions his fate and his comrades must fight off the sinister allure of the magical gold ring. And it's in this aspect that Jackson elevates the film beyond mere adventure escapism. He treats the story's metaphorical properties with due gravity, but without falling into turgid sermonizing. He strikes a nice balance of deeper meaning and sheer entertainment.Weighty with Middle-earth lore and eye-dazzling vistas of the storybook Shire, the Elvish town of Rivendell and ravaged land of Mordor; alive with the personalities of jaunty hobbits, toiling gnomes, enchanting elves and dashing warriors, the film is a fine wonder of technical achievement and masterly acting in service of a rich, rousing and meaningful story. The computer-generated images transform the New Zealand locations into views that will take your breath away and only someone with a pathological aversion to fantasy could fail to be absorbed and transported by this stunning, sincere and frequently terrifying adaptation. Cinematically inspiring, the costume, production design, prosthetic body parts and make up are extraordinary in their detail, complete in every way.Peter Jackson does not only attempt the most ambitious film project in modern cinema history, he pulls it off with a breathtaking mixture of nerve and verve, conjuring the most potent major-motion-picture magic in years.","

"Sylviastel","26 June 2002","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring would make the late author very proud. It is extremely well done with a great cast of actors. There are not enough female roles in this story and it is a great story. Who would have thought that Sean Astin grew up to be a hobbit from his days as a ""goonie"" and Tobey Maguire who was best known for his role in the Ice Storm as Mike. Now he is the star of the film. He plays beside the wonderful attractive Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, the magnificent Christopher Lee as the dastardly wizard gone arye, Sir Ian McKellen as the wonderful charming gandalf(Sure he could play Macbeth and Shakespearan role but he certainly can play his friend, Dame Maggie Smith, in a Saturday Night Live appearance. He was just perfect and now he plays with his action figures. Then there is wonderful Sir Ian Holm (Just imagine two Sir Ians on the set, what are the chances). The film is about 3 hours and after all that there is still more and you want more. I only wished that they would finally give knighthood to Christopher Lee and John Rhys-Davies.","

"dataconflossmoor","27 November 2007","How can a film miss when it has everything going for it, storyline, graphics, authenticated digitalization, and maybe some of the most fabulous cinematography that I have ever seen in any movie made whatsoever!! This was a painstaking effort of folklore and fantasy which homogenized in conjunction with the rendition of the novel ""Lord of the Rings"" by Tolken!!! I do not know if anybody remembers the animated version of ""Lord of the Rings"" made in 1978? I enjoyed it very much!! However, with this triumvirate of epic ""Lord of the Rings"" movies which besieged the movie viewer in the early part of this decade, and eventually took the movie industry by storm, more and more film aficionados will appreciate Tolken's work now than ever before!! ""Fellowship of the Ring"" fascinates the movie audience by manufacturing monsters who wind up taking on mere mortals... This induces a David and Goliath confrontation which provides a suspenseful entertainment for anyone watching this film!! I just cannot get over the breathtaking cinematography in this film!! I believe it was filmed in New Zealand, now, I want to go there!!! Rated as one of the top twenty American movies ever made, I definitely recommend seeing ""Lord of the Rings/ Fellowship of the Ring"" Survival of the fittest never became more creative than with this movie!!","

"inserrtnamehere","3 January 2015","This film (along with the entire trilogy) is regarded as one of the greatest, most influential films of all time and with good reason. This movie has audiences captivated from the beginning to the end. Even watching it in 2015, I am still stunned by the special effects, the set, the scenery, the acting, the plot, the camera shots and angles, the make up, the costumes, and the editing among many other factors. Most note-worthy is the score which brings a whole new perspective and sound to science fiction and to fictitious worlds and characters. Even though the story contains a lot of sci-fi jargon, the writing and dialog do a very good job in relaying the information to the audience. The writers did an excellent job in simplifying and clarifying an intricate and brilliant story.Well done Peter Jackson. You deserve the fame and fortune you received from this movie.","

"noralee","13 December 2005","Seeing ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" made me feel like a kid again, bringing me back to 1958 watching ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" with Ray Harryhausen's heroic special effects. ""LOTR"" claims its rightful place as one of the founts of inspiration for ""Star Wars,"" with its conflicted good guys up against a growing stronger evil -- that resonates in a post-9/11 world as it must have for Tolkien post-WWI and concurrent with WWII (and eerily like HBO's ""Band of Brothers"").The cast of Brits, Americans and Antipodeans (including obscure favorites of mine from Brit TV and indie movies) team up amidst special effects that are thrilling yet comprehensibly old-fashioned. In terms of comparing it to the book, I'm one of possibly two or three Baby Boomers who didn't read ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" until this month (and will wait to complete the rest of the cycle in time for the following two movies), so I was both fresher to the material and less fanatical about it than some, including clarifications of some bits that I had misunderstood in the book.I appreciated some of the telescoping of details (such as combining the elf princess Arwen, as played by Liv Tyler, with a legendary princess' love story) and missed others (by leaving out Tom Borondil and his mate the River's Daughter, the brightness of nature is left out, making for a darker movie than even the book). The endless exposition in the book is handled well, as both voice overs and through flash-back demonstrations. The final DVD will include deleted scenes.Particularly well-handled is graphically showing the tempting danger of the Ring's evil power, on others and on Frodo -- a key difference in the mature themes of ""LOTR"" in comparison to ""The Hobbit.""I was disappointed that the songs and mythic poetry were barely replaced by Enya's hardly noticeable background music.(originally written 12/29/2001)","

He needs to be a likable sad Guy.The visuals are still amazing, It looks so good. There are some scenes where they use 3D puppets and character for a meme guy in the minds that I ice couldn't not look at but all the other things look amazing and the painting they used in the background and special effects and many sneaky ways they used the camera as to make the hobbits look smaller than they are. Actors amazing job they made this story with is a bit hokey and cringe sometimes but they sell it it never feels cringe it feels so honest and believable despite. How old fashioned fantasy it is.I have watched this movie a lot of times and I still tear up at some points, I still get emotional and if I still do that that means that the movie still has a lot of value and sentimental abilities and honest and wholesome and friendly bromance between every character is what I need.","

"dgallegos","25 November 2002","Star Wars has been dethroned.  Although George Lucas' movies are good in their own right (except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise), his scripts (which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien, mythology & religion) can't compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy `The Lord of the Rings'.  Granted, Lucas took on a herculean task in writing & directing his story himself, but Tolkien's words, along with Peter Jackson's faithful adaptation & inspired vision, have created something no one man could equal. Of course, it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal, & New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. They spent $180 million to film all 3 simultaneously.  With the New Zealand exchange rate, that equals $360 million ($90 million ea.), but since they used many of the same sets, and FX development costs were spread throughout, we're seeing $120-$150 million on the screen.  This will ensure consistency in plot, casting, tone, etc.In 3 hours, Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel & then some into the film, rewriting some scenes & dialogue with lesser characters for the leads, leaving out only what there wasn't enough time for.  Basically, you have two 90 min. movies running back to back.  There are no slow spots, just one climax after another.  From the opening 10 min. backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace, I was blown away.  The romance between Aragorn, king in exile, and Arwen, daughter of the elf-lord, is played up for the ""Titanic"" quotient, but it's well done. The story, sets, costumes & FX are so rich, you'll have to see the film several times to absorb everything.  The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey.  The location sets are imaginative, detailed & weathered, adding to their believability, while the studio sets match them in meticulousness.  The costumes are at once familiar & strange, drawing on both the medievil & the fantastic, but more important, they're also functional & practical.  The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping, Celtic & folky in keeping with the novel, although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but neither would commit a year or more to a 3 picture project.  The FX are as they should be, unobtrusive & unnoticed most of the time, there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most Hollywood movies which try to coverup illogical plots & bad acting. I'm particularly gratified by the casting of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director.  I've always thought Mortenson had an intensity & striking but not pretty-boy looks that could portray a flawed, dangerous hero instead of the villains Hollywood always picked him for.A stellar cast giving some of their best performances, visuals that deliver beyond what I imagined, a perfect mix of humor, passion & tragedy, and a feeling of grandeur, scope & impending doom.  Perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many characters & the inability to concentrate on any one, it can't be measured against some of the classic character study films, but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the ideas & not get lost  As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the greatest films of all time.","

"yavidarabia","31 July 2022","Without sounding pompous, Fellowship (cinematically) is the best of the three films. Many right-brain fans will deem the latter two as they involve more 'action' so to speak, but unfortunately deter from the lore of Tolkien's' masterpiece.Not only do I believe this is the best of the three, I believe Fellowship is one of the best films ever produced. It fulfills in my mind what a '10' movie merits: Perfect Cast, beautiful Cinematography , amazing Dialogue, Remarkable Soundtrack, and overall excellent direction from Peter Jackson where he paces the film perfectly, taking time with introductions but never boring the viewer.Gandalfs scene with the aesthetically CGI Balrog (which still holds up) stands alone as the best scene of the entire Trilogy--Ian McKellon's performance truly shines. Enjoy Frodo at his best before we are dealt with a not so heroic and quite annoying counterpart dealt to us in the sequels.To all fans: many older fans (50+) agree this is the best of the Trilogy. AFI selected Fellowship (and only Fellowship) in their 100 Years...100 Movies and in a half-hearted appeal to cast authority, Elijah Wood believes this is the best. ""Best"" was the focus of this review, not to dampen the brilliance of the latter two, but rather highlight the beauty this film holds.I have the Trilogy from best to not so best: 1, 3, 2 with scores 10, 9, and 8 respectively.-J.","

"Enrique-Sanchez-56","19 January 2002","A few thousand reviews in a month or so bespeaks of many things.  I find it hard to add what has already been said.  But I will try to capsulize my take on LORD OF THE RINGS:1.  Superlatives are insufficient to describe the utter awe that this movie has elicited - in me - and in the world.2.  You'll never be able to please everyone. Mr. Jackson has virtually achieved that. I haven't seen such a splendiferous response to a movie in a long time - not even from 'Titanic' or 'Harry Potter'.3.  The movie's opening comes at the most propitious time in history.  We need fantasy right now, Harry Potter and other vehicles are providing that...but it is hard to compare them to the sheer virtuosity of this movie's execution.4.  3 hours has always been a horror story to Hollywood's mass market audiences. But to anyone who has attended a screening of a really long movie like Bertolucci's '1900' 5 hrs+  or 'The Sorrow and The Pity' (almost 5 hours - depending on the version), 3 hours is NOTHING.  Movies SEEM to be getting longer these days.  But the audiences are not complaining as much as they once did.  This is a good thing.    Frankly, at the end of the movie...I just wanted to go ON AND ON.5.  Every actor, every scene, every effect is believable. Despite the more than generous mix of sets, real outdoor scenes, created outdoor scenes and mixtures of these, one's beliefs are never jarred from the Tolkein-Jackson fantasy world.6.  The Howard Shore music (which suggests some measure of doom by adapting the most famous motto in history - second only to Beethoven's Fate Motto from his Symphony #5 in Cminor - the DIES IRAE (Day of Wrath) theme from 'Office of the Dead' from the extensive catalog of Gregorian chants) - uses music and sound and not just Super-compressed FOLEY sounds (which are OVERUSED these days to a fault instead of music in order to shock audiences into an artificial level of frenzy)...to evoke true suspense and excitement.
7.  Elijah Wood - proves that no other actor could have portrayed Frodo (even if the 'book Frodo' was much older).  His performance is astonishing in the breadth he exudes with the economy he expends.  His eyes are among the most expressive I've seen in a long time.    Elijah has always taken the more interesting and unflashy parts during his surprising career. But in each role I have seen, he has brought deep human emotion and a strength found ever so rarely in the more flashy actors. This is not to deride as Speilberg's choice of Haley Joel Osment as Frodo. Quite simply, Haley would have been just too young and though his talents seem limitless to us now, Elijah just IS FRODO. Thanks to all involved in the making of this masterpiece.  The world cannot wait for the next two!","

"Teyss","1 December 2022","This review addresses all three movies that strictly speaking do not form a trilogy since they are connected, the same way Tolkien's opus was a single novel published in three volumes, each comprising two ""Books"". To simplify, the works are referenced by the following acronyms: FR (The Fellowship of the Ring), TT (The Two Towers), RK (The Return of the King).THE QUALITIESThe movies are visually impressive and do not seem long despite running for a total of 9h20 (11h30 in the extended version that is not discussed here). Pacing is sustained, maybe too much, yet does allow slow scenes as in the Shire, Rivendell and Lothlorien. Within this logic, rhythm is more credible: the 17 years between Gandalf leaving the Shire and returning feel much shorter (FR); Frodo leaves immediately after Gandalf does whilst in the novel it takes months (FR).The selection of scenes is adequate. Due to length several were omitted which triggered criticism, notably the part with Tom Bombadil (FR) or Saruman trying to outsmart Sauron (TT), but they are not very important losses. The scouring of the Shire and Saruman's death at the end of RK are discarded because it is anticlimactic, albeit meaningful since the Hobbits are transformed by their journey and Frodo rejects violence. Also, the movies essentially omit Tolkien's numerous songs and poems which is a good point: they would have been awkward on screen especially since they are not pieces of superlative literature.The structure is revised arguably for the better: Tolkien focuses during several chapters on selected characters, intentionally leaving the reader in expectation regarding others for a long time (TT, RK). Here scenes alternate hence the viewer is permanently updated, since it would be difficult in cinema to grasp the concomitance of plots that can be outlined in writing. The movies also move explanations to prologues: Sauron and the Rings of Power, for immediate clarity (FR); how Smeagol took the Ring, for substance (RK). Last, endings differ from the Books to limit cliffhangers which seems paradoxical yet makes sense for films released over three years: the Orcs' attack is moved from the beginning of TT to the end of FR, avoiding a suspended action; Frodo's capture by Orcs in the mountain is moved from the end of TT to the beginning of RK.The movies illustrate some of Tolkien's themes: good vs evil, fate, duty, courage, addiction to power, environment (Saruman destroying trees), etc. Some critics have argued they are secondary, but let's be honest: so are they in the novel which includes lengthy parts with action and dialogs, seldom about metaphysics. Indeed it is difficult to combine epic and depth, ""Moby Dick"" being a notable exception. In fact the films manage to be slightly less sexist by providing additional parts to female roles: Galadriel voices the FR prologue; Arwen is more present; she rescues Frodo in FR and telepathically helps Aragorn after his fall in TT; Eowyn has a stronger personality. On the other hand, the movies preserve the traditional values of the novel: the view on races is Manichean and monarchy is glorified.The movies efficiently include elements from Tolkien's History of Middle-earth: Gandalf reading the scroll of Isildur in Minas Tirith (FR), the romance between Arwen and Aragorn, the origins of Orcs about which Tolkien's explanations varied. They also add short scenes strengthening consistency and visual impact: Elrond tells Gandalf how Isildur refused to destroy the Ring in a way different than Tolkien's, announcing Frodo's turnaround at the end of RK (FR); everyone argues at the Council of Elrond under the influence of the Ring (FR); Boromir is tempted by the Ring in the mountain (FR); Theoden's mind is possessed by Saruman instead of just being deluded by Wormtongue (TT); Aragorn convinces the spectres to join him (RK); the four Hobbits interestingly have mixed feelings after returning to the Shire (RK).Visual effects are convincing notably Frodo's vision when he wears the Ring and the bestiary, except Ents who are cartoonesque. Artefacts and sets are awesome, notably Moria, Edoras and Minas Tirith, bar some looking partly fake: parts of Rivendell, parts of Lothlorien, Mount Doom, the Grey Havens. Scenery is breathtaking to the point of being a permanent advertising for New Zealand, enhanced by several aerial shots and inserts for instance the two giant statues on river Anduin in FR. Sound effects are impressive, for example noises illustrating the power of the Ring.The soundtrack, beautifully performed by renowned orchestras, choirs and singers, is based on varied, catching and evolving leitmotifs representing characters, places and the Ring: with approximately 100 of these, it is according to Wikipedia the largest catalogue ever, surpassing that of the entire Star Wars series. The drawback is music is almost continuous so our ears do feel like a rest at times.THE LIMITSThe movies overdramatise situations even when it's not required. There is a general tendency to overact, frequently highlighted by close shots: we see a lot of frowning, intense gazing and exalted dialogues. Orcs, filmed in detail, are beyond ghastly and frequently shout instead of simply being present which would have been loathsome enough. The score sometimes adds a layer of grandiloquence. This is unfortunately a tendency in contemporary cinema to give the audience its money's worth of sound, performance, camera movements, special effects and so on. Essentially it tells us how we should feel.Characters are relatively shallow but let's be honest again: so are they in the novel where psychology is reduced and villains like Saruman, Wormtongue and Sauron are completely kept in the background which is unfortunate for the important good vs evil theme. Indeed it is difficult to combine epic and emotions, ""War and Peace"" being a notable exception together with the abovementioned. Actually the movies depict Gollum, Saruman and even Wormtongue better than the novel does. On the other hand, Frodo is mainly shown as whiny which is one-sided (the actor's youth could partly explain this): because of that and the increased focus on Aragorn, we almost feel the latter is the lead role, in contradiction with Tolkien's intention. Only at the very end do we fully empathise with Frodo's unredeemable physical and psychological traumas. As a side note, the mighty Gimli becomes a comic relief, which is acceptable to offset all the action and tension throughout.Battles are too extensive: Moria (FR), river Anduin (FR), Helm's Deep (TT), Minas Tirith (RK), the Black Gate (RK). Granted, Tolkien also describes them at length but we reach saturation earlier when watching than reading. The movies also add totally unrequired combats: Gandalf vs Saruman whilst a longer dialogue between the two wizards would have been more stimulating (FR), the gates of Moria (FR), the Wargs' attack (TT), the Ents storming Isengard (TT), the taking of Osgiliath (RK), the last two being only evoked in the novel.By contrast to the above note about purposefully added short scenes, some extra and long subplots are useless: Aragorn falls after the Wargs' attack (TT); Faramir takes Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath and the Nazgul attacks (TT); Arwen decides to leave overseas (TT) and changes her mind (RK); Frodo sends Sam away (RK).The movies do not try to clarify the novel's inconsistencies. Why only include 9 members in the Fellowship (yes there are also 9 Black Riders, so what)? What are the odds of 8 of those 9 surviving such a quest? Why do Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli choose to save two blundering Hobbits instead of continuing to help the Ring-Bearer who will decide the fate of Middle-earth (FR)? Why don't Saruman and Sauron coordinate their attacks instead of letting their enemies regroup (TT, RK)? And why does Sauron only unleash a part of his troops against Minas Tirith (RK)? If the giant eagles can defeat Nazguls, why don't they intervene at the battle of Minas Tirith (RK), and even Helm's Deep (TT)? And why don't they simply carry Frodo towards Mount Doom instead of letting him walk all the way, the same way they bring him back? There are only two exceptions: the fact four inexperienced Hobbits are allowed to join five mighty fighters on such a dangerous and essential mission is handled with humour (FR); the Black Riders altogether abandon Weathertop because Aragorn completely dominates them, which is a minor inconsistency compared to the absence of explanation (FR).-----Overall the ""Trilogy"" is technically impeccable and coherent even if Tolkien's fans could feel deceived. Despite the grandiloquence and emphasis on combat, style is realistic with great care for details: Peter Jackson said he wanted his films to look like a historical account. Out of the three movies, TT is arguably slightly superior: pacing is more abated despite the long battle in Helm's Deep, that is well shot anyhow; Gollum's personality is revealed; there are beautiful sequences such as the ones involving Arwen; the atmosphere is more dreamlike in line with the novel, for instance Frodo's dream at the beginning or the Dead Marshes; the opening backward aerial shot on the mountains is compelling, as if we were leaving them with the characters.In summary ""The Two Towers"" leans more towards fantasy whilst the other two movies lean more towards action. One reason might be the former as a book is approximately 20% shorter than ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", whilst as film they both run for 3 hours: Jackson had more time to include atmospheric elements instead of just events, especially after moving two sequences as noted. ""The Return of the King"" is also shorter on paper, however despite running for 3h20 on screen is mainly focused on action with the chaotic crossing to Mordor and the lengthy battle of Minas Tirith, as well as on the epilogue (20 minutes following Frodo awaking in Minas Tirith).","

"TxMike","10 August 2002","I went to school in the 1950s and 1960s. I never read ""The Hobbit"" nor any of the ""Ring"" trilogies. So I only had a vague idea what Tolkien and his writings were all about, although I already knew there were ""Ring"" fanatics of all ages out there. I got a ""free"" DVD as a result of the Blockbuster campaign where you buy a 10-week rental card for $25 and get a DVD in return at no extra cost. A deal I couldn't refuse!Well, last night I watched the film, along with good friends Frank and Judy who happen to be ""Ringheads."" The filming was absolutely gorgeous. The DVD transfer is about the best I have seen so far, and the Dolby 5.1 sound is very dynamic and beautiful. In short about all one could ask for in a DVD. Plus, there is a second disk which has over two hours of ""extras"", several ""making of"" plus a 10-minute preview of the second installment due out later this year. While the movie itself is very interesting, especially the first one-third which sets the stage for the journey that ""the fellowship of the ring"" will undertake, to ultimately return the ""one ring"" to the volcano, NEVER did I feel that this was a ""great"" film. As the story unfolds there are increasingly brutal battles to be fought, one after another, with little story between each battle. While that may make for really good reading, where you can create exactly the images you want in your own mind, as a film it gets to be a bit much. I actually became bored, with yet another battle and narrow escape. Like adding too much spice to a good meal.As a film of a historic work of fiction, and especially this DVD release, it is almost perfect.  However, as a fictional work the story is a bit of a let-down, in my opinion. It is best appreciated by all the ""Ringheads"" out there who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For my own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works. Maybe I'll have a different opinion in two years, after I've seen all three of the installments.","

"HersheyAddict314","20 June 2002","The Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Rings. The first time I saw those letters appear on a trailer while watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (in May), I thought it was the most ridiculous title for a movie. The trailer was disgusting-I thought the strange-haired little 'people' (later known as hobbits) were ugly and esoteric. Vaguely, I remember whispering to my best friend at the time, 'Ew...who's going to see THAT? What kind of freak would see a movie with such UGLY people??' Little did I know, I would become obsessed with this 'lurid' movie.About 7 months later, the tickets to 'A Beautiful Mind' were sold out, so I opted to go for LOTR, because nothing else seemed worth my $5.50. The movie astonished me right from the first scene, with the thousands of realistic warriors and beautiful scenery, I was immediately hooked. Throughout the movie, I don't think I blinked once. The characters, the Elvish language, the setting, everything intruiged me. It was artistically and originally beautiful, not at all what I expected. I didn't even notice 3 hours passing by before it ended and I sat dumbstruck in the theater for a while, listening to Enya vocalize 'May It Be.' I walked out of the theater like I walked into a new world.6 more times I saw the Lord of the Rings. I have two copies of the soundtrack (which is also fabulous) and am counting the days until the Two Towers. For anybody who has not seen this incredible movie, I suggest that you run to the nearest Blockbusters and rent it on August 6th, when it'll be released on DVD and VHS. It's almost essential to life. The actors-Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortensen-beautifully and acurately protrayed the characters of J.R.R. Tolkien's historic masterpiece, and Peter Jackson stayed true to the novel. I've read the books and became deeply interested in things I never have before, and have looked at things just a bit differently in this world.I highly recommend the Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Rings, to anybody at any age anytime. It is my favorite movie, and I'm not surprised that over 60,000 others voted this movie as worthy of #3 on the spot of the top 250 movies of all time.","

"Gibson-H","16 June 2022","""The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the ring"" is directed by Peter Jackson.It stars Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Sean Astin and Christopher Lee.The first part in this great trilogy follows a hobbit named ""Frodo"" and companions who are tasked with destroying the one ring which could bring chaos and destruction to ""Middle Earth"".""The Lord of the rings"" trilogy is for me the greatest trilogy ever made. I could watch these films any day.The positivesThe films premise and story is fantastic. The film is near enough three hours of setup but it also does a great job in captivating you to watch the next films. Every character has distinct personalities along with great motivations and starter development. The romances and friendships all feel real thanks to all the actors having great chemistry along with great performances. ""Ian McKellen"" is for me perfect casting. No one else can play ""Gandalf"" In my eyes. The action in this film is fantastic. Not only are the stakes high in them but they are shot brilliantly. The whole film is shot fantastically. There's so many unique shots in the film that are memorable. The character design and makeup are all flawless. The ""Orc"" makeup is so good that I sometimes forget the people playing them are actors as they look so real. The CGI is fantastic even to today's standards. Finally the film also manages to be really scary. The film is full of creatures that won't hesitate to kill. When the characters are in danger I still get chills because of how scary those scenes are.The negativesThe only minor flaw is that a couple of action scenes just last a bit too long especially the staircase scene. But all the action is entertaining and full of tension.ConclusionFor me, ""Fellowship of the ring"" is one of the best first acts to a trilogy ever made. With its interesting story and characters, incredible chemistry and acting from the actors, brilliant camerawork, thrilling action, state of the art CGI, great makeup and some genuine scary scenes make this film almost perfect.I'm going to give ""The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the ring"" a:10/10.","

"rob_hyland49","18 April 2002","I love this film. I simply love it. This is Tolkiens novel, and the world of Middle-Earth, the characters of Middle-Earth and the events of Middle-Earth! I love this film.This is the kind of film that will be passed down from generation to generation to generation. It is THAT good.There are three wizards: Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Peter Jackson, the director. The breathtaking detail Jackson has put into this is incredible. Lets start with the acting.This is a star studded cast, with Elijah Wood in the main role as Frodo, McKellen as mentioned, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Liv Tyler . .. the list goes on and on and on. Each has put 101% into this masterpiece, and it really shows.The sets are incredible. One can believe they are in Khazad-Dum, or in Bree, or in Hobbiton, or Rivendell particuarly. It will take your breath away, some of the incredible locations. We know each is not real, but there is a hint of realism in there.This is a special effects bananza, used only when needed. In Khazad-Dum and Isengard particuarly you can almost feel the power given off by the magic in this film.The costumes are perfect. The score (designed by Howard Shore) is breathtakingly beautiful. And throughout this, Jackson maintains a sense of calm and reality in the film, and it is this inner flare and outer cool that makes him and the entire cast and crew the magicians that they are. Probably the greatest motion picture of cinema history. 10+ out of 10.","

"SteveB Ohio","9 July 2002","Reading the other reviews here, it seems that people either loved this movie or they hated it.  It also seems that those who say they hated it don't give any concrete reasons other than they don't seem to ""get the point.""  The same is true of the books that this series is based on: some people think them to be the best works of fiction of all time, while others think they are nonsense.  Well, you can count me firmly in the ""loved it"" camp!Ever since I first read these books in the '70s I have hoped that someone would make them into movies. (My other hope is that someone would take on the project of making quality film versions of Isaac Asimov's ""Foundation Trilogy,"" but that's a different story!)  The animated version was mediocre at best, but this one is breathtaking!  Never mind the minor differences between the film and the books, this has got to be the best adaptation of book to cinema that I have ever seen.  I would dare say that it is even the best film of any type that I have seen.Why?  If you are one of those who ""don't get it,"" I can't offer anything to convince you.  Let's just say that this movie brings to life the incredible world that J.R.R. Tolkein created in a way that transcends simple fantasy. The characters and places are believable as real rather than mere creations of a fairy tale world. The story has more substance than the comic book style of the Star Wars series.   The action is gripping.  The visual effects are stunning.  There is genuine emotion, from joy to despair.  The acting is flawless.   And through the entire experience, there is the constant theme of pure good versus pure evil; and staying true to one's friends and commitments regardless of how bad things get.  And it does it without being preachy about it:  it is totally free of the absurd political correctness that infects so many other films.This movie hits on all cylinders.  The first time I saw it, I was in a theater that was completely packed.  Nobody got up during its three hour length.  There was no whispering or other signs of inattention.  When it was over and the lights came on, there was a continued hush that was almost reverent.  When people started to get up, I heard comments like ""It's going to be a long year.""  (Meaning, of course, it will be a long wait until the second installment is released this December.)The only flaw I can find is that it was too fast-paced in some places, resulting in some parts of the story being a blur for those who aren't already familiar with the books.  Even so, the three hours go by very quickly and leave you wanting to see more of the story.  That will have to wait until the end of this year!For those who haven't yet seen it, I would strongly recommend reading the books (or at least read The Fellowship of the Ring) and then rent or buy the dvd when it is released this August.","

"tomimt","22 May 2005","I am a fan of the book. I admit it right here in the beginning. I have also been waiting for someone to turn the books into a movie or movies since I first time saw incomplete animation by Ralph Bakshi.Then some years ago I began to hear rumours, that a director from New Zealand, Peter Jackson was about to take on this task. The name wasn't unfamiliar to me: I had seen his previous movies, Brain Dead, Bad Taste and The Frighteners. I didn't know what to think. I did like the movies, but then again he was a splatter movie expert, not fantasy.Then I watched them again, and I saw the visual tricks and camera usage he had achieved in those little films and I became more confident. The subtle fantasy elements in Brain Dead convinced me of his abilities. But still, I was little afraid: could he pull it off?Then, sometime later, after hours of studying rumours and leaked photos in internet I and my friend finally got our hands wrapped around the tickets, tickets to get us in one of the first viewings after the premiere around here where I live. My throat was dry and I was anxious to see the final product.Couple of hours later my friend and I left the theatre mesmerized. It had been more than we expected, light years above anything we'd seen before on the screen. We spent hours talking about the experience and we came in conclusion, that if the quality of the first film were a promise from things to come there wouldn't be anything to worry about.Besides of the stunning cinematography, music and special effects there are amazing actor performances seen all over the film: Ian McKellen as Gandalf, a wise old wizard who is leading the fellowship through perilous journey. Sean Bean as Boromir, son of Denethor, steward of Gonodr. Christopher Lee as Saruman the White, corrupted head of the wizard's council. John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, son of Gloin, a dwarfish warrior. Billy Boyd as Pippin and Dominc Monaghan as Merry, two loyal friends of Frodo (Elijah Wood), and Samwise (Sean Astin).Only two actors I didn't immediately fell for were Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, or Strider if you will, and Orlando Bloom as Legolas. There wasn't anything specific in Bloom's case; the part just wasn't a huge acting part, mainly just looking pretty. In Mortensen case I was little bit distracted by his, perhaps little too calm at first, portrayal of Aragorn. But I got over it.The special extended edition didn't bring anything crucial to the movie, just some scenes adding more depth to the story, like the journey of the elves, where Frodo and Sam see the elves travelling in the forest, going towards the Grey Havens, in order to leave the Middle Earth.Fellowship of The Rings was and is extremely good start for the one of the most stunning trilogies of the movie history.","

"FilmSchoolWriter","29 January 2006","I have never been a fan of Tolkein's works. Whenever I've tried to read them, I've become bored and have stopped bothering. It's taken me a while to get around to watching The Lord of the Rings, but I am very glad that I have now seen it. In fact, it actually made me read the books and I prefer the movies to the books.One of the things that I enjoyed so much about this movie is the absolutely *stunning* cinematography. Filming in New Zealand was a brilliant move and I am so glad that this was filmed ""on location"" instead of in the studio. I realize that a good deal of this movie is CGI, but it flows beautifully and there aren't any particular moments where you say, ""AHA! Green screen! Right there!""I truly enjoyed the performances given by the lead actors. Especially Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn. His performance is authentic and he obviously strove to not only play, but *become* his character. Orlando Bloom is wonderful as Legolas and this is easily one of my favorite performances from him. Although in all technicality Legolas is a supporting character, he is an individual supporting character. In the fellowship, there are no other elves for him to be supporting, so in that aspect he is a very individual character, even if he is not the lead. Elijah Wood is good as well -- he does a wonderful job of capturing the simplicity of Frodo and his depressed emotional state. And more credit to Mortensen as well as Liv Tyler with their emotion charged love scenes. A rare thing in Hollywood, these scenes are more sensual then sexual -- a welcome relief from the modern Hollywood blockbuster that just screams sex.Many people aren't particularly wowed by Peter Jackson's directing ability. But I have to say that I think he did a wonderful job. Despite the 178 minutes running time, the movie never drags once. Jackson did a good job of getting as much as he possibly could out of his actors and that is easily the film's biggest asset. This is an amazing film and everyone should see it.","

These are the type of men that people can look up to.All these three movies will forever be my personal favourite.

This film is so amazing, I hardly have any words and this is the worst of the three LOTR movies. The movie starts with Frodo Baggins inheriting a doomed ring from his second cousin, Bilbo Baggins. Along with Frodo, 3 more hobbits, 2 men, a wizard, an elf, and a dwarf must venture to the Mordor where the evil Sauron reigns to destroy the cursed ring. The actors were cast perfectly. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, and Viggo Mortensen were great as their respective roles. The music is amazing. Howard Shore lives up to my score expectations. This soundtrack is one of the better ones with the Celtic-like themes. The special effects are great especially during the battle scenes. There are some sad moments in this film. I was sad to see Boromir die. He meant no harm to Frodo and he made it up by sacrificing his life for Merry and Pippin. I was sad to see Gandalf ""die."" But, I'm sure that he will be back. This movie deserves more than 4 Academy Awards. I rate this movie 10/10.","

"TheLastStop41","12 February 2002","I know it's my second time writing a review on Lord of the Rings, but this isn't it particularly about Lord of the Rings. As some of you have read my last review (it was only posted yesterday, so the chances you did read it) you could tell just by my one line summary that I loved the movie. This year's academy competition for my guess will be Lord of the Rings vs. A Beautiful Mind.  One of the nominees for both movies, which most of you know, is the best director award. Though I have not seen A Beautiful Mind, I would like to say that Peter Jackson should win for two main reasons. 1. He's a director that has not done a lot of movies and he has just created a masterpiece. And 2. Since he's a director who hasn't done many movies, it's very hard to make a movie that's going to be nominated for best picture which he has accomplished, but it's even harder for a a rookie director to make a masterpiece that is based on a book. Yeah Ron Howard is real good director, but many people aren't capable of making a masterpiece movie based on a masterpiece book trilogy. I know there's nothing any of you people can do about it, but I just felt that Peter Jackson is the one who I think truly deserves Best Director.","

When the movie came out, it got such rave reviews and looked so interesting that I was quite eager to see it. When I finally did see it, I was SO impressed. The story is absolutely enthralling, the special affects were amazing, and the acting was superb. This movie really got me more interested in all the actors playing the hobbits, and also Ian McKellen, actually to be honest, I REALLY enjoyed all the actors, especially, Viggo Mortensen(playing Aragorn). There is not one element, one scene in this movie, (in my opinion) that could use any improvement. I would strongly recommend this movie to any who enjoys the fantasy\science fiction, even if you have not read the books. This is the best movie I have ever seen, and I can't wait to see the rest of the trilogy.","

"SnoopyStyle","21 September 2016","Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring to rule them all. He loses the battle and the ring is lost. It passes through the hands of Isildur, Gollum, and finally lands with Bilbo Baggins. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) arrives in the Shire to visit Bilbo. Bilbo goes on a personal journey leaving the burden of the ring to Frodo (Elijah Wood). Frodo sets off on a quest to save the world with his best friend Samwise (Sean Astin). Along the way, others join this Fellowship of the Ring.Peter Jackson delivers a near-perfect execution of this fantasy classic. The CGI is state-of-the-art but the movie does not get bogged down with battles of massive armies. The action is visceral and thrilling. The characters are compelling and the performances are near perfect. The internal conflicts over the ring actually drive the narrative and ultimately generates great paranoia and isolation for Frodo. This is a great start.","

"FlickJunkie-2","29 August 2002","Prior to this film, Director Peter Jackson was obscure even among the anonymous wannabes of the film industry.  His resume consisted of a half a dozen indy films in the horror and comedy genres.  If you took the budgets of all his prior films together, they wouldn't equal his salary for this franchise.  He now owns the second highest grossing film in history.  Talk about a Cinderella story!This film was somewhat of a personal obsession for Jackson.  It took eight years from inception to completion.  He originally pitched the idea to Miramax who agreed to take it on and then balked at the cost of a two movie deal and backed out.  Desperate to save the project, he presented it to New Line Cinema and convinced them that if he filmed in New Zealand, used his own effects company and filmed all three movies back to back, he could make three films for less than the cost of two.  They bought the project and gave him a record $270 Million budget for the three.  He completed the filming for all three films in 16 months of continual shooting, a record.Jackson's task was daunting.  He wanted to create a film with mass appeal that was true to the classic books.  Considering the devoted following of Tolkien's trilogy, their preoccupation with the smallest trivia and the sheer volume of the works, this was an almost impossible task.  Jackson decided to lean toward the action/adventure elements, while paying homage to aficionados with scenes that compressed the intricacies of the various cultures and contained allusions to various pieces of trivia that only devotees of the books would understand.  The result is a terrific film that doesn't leave the books out of the screenplay.The transformation of the real world into the fantasy world is nothing short of fantastic.  The combination of makeup, set decoration, costumes, New Zealand locations and special effects sets a new standard for this or any genre.  The attention to detail is astounding from the elf ears to the hobbit toes.The ensemble cast does a fine job without any need for a superstar.  Elijah Wood is lovable and believable as the dauntless Frodo.  Wood has the perfect combination of childlike exuberance and steely resolve to play the ring bearer.   Ian McClellan, who is a big ring fan himself, is perfectly cast as Gandalf.  With almost 40 years in TV and films, McKellen is one of the veterans of the cast.  He is a powerful dramatic actor and he renders Gandalf with great range.  He is formidable and commanding in some scenes, and tender and paternal in the scenes with Frodo.  Along with Christopher Lee (55 years in film) the battle of the elders is given enormous dramatic power.Viggo Mortensen is awesome as Aragon.  Mortensen demanded to do all his own stunts and trained exhaustively at swordsmanship and other combat skills to make his fight scenes as realistic as possible.  In one scene he had a tooth knocked out and after a quick trip to the dentist he was back on the set later that day.  Ian Holm is wonderful as Bilbo Baggins.  Holm captures the ageless hobbit with a youthful enthusiasm that belies his advanced age.This film is really more the first episode of a miniseries than a film that stands alone.  By the end it is clear that we haven't yet reached the middle, even if you never read the books.  Still, at three hours, it never drags.It is a tremendous filmmaking achievement that redefines the fantasy genre and sets production standards that will be difficult to equal.  It is fabulously entertaining for audiences of all ages.  One cannot see this film and not be eager for the next episode to be released.  I rated it a 10/10. It is motion picture history in the making.","

"Sfpsycho415","11 March 2004","While Fellowship of the Ring is a good adventure movie, i also think it is very overrated. It doesn't hold a candle to A New Hope. The first part of the trilogy gets off to a slow start as we meet the characters who will soon become the fellowship. It picks up speed when the faceless, hood-wearing, horsemen come looking for the ring. There are some great action scenes that follow and an exciting cliffhanger at the end. I own this, the Two Towers, and will own Return of the King because they are good movies. But masterpieces they are not. They get slow at times, become cheesy at other times, and the acting is not top of the line. I'd give the whole trilogy a 7 out of 10. No more, no less. 7/10","

Director Peter Jackson and his superb, highly motivated cast and crew have done the seemingly impossible in turning Tolkien's beloved books into a movie, and they have done it so amazingly well - finding their own idiosyncratic interpretations while staying absolutely true to the spirit of the book - that all I can say is: Go and see it!! - if you haven't done so yet.","

"BabelAlexandria","11 January 2022","After viewing in the theaters (early 2000s) and the extended DVD versions (late 2000s), I recently purchased the remastered 4K UHD blu rays with Dolby Atmos, and watched the entire series with my kiddos (7 and 9). It was a fabulous experience, with top-notch picture and sound enhancing the canonical greatness of the story (and the film) itself. It took us about five weeks (December through early January) to watch all three films; in fact, if the extended version is included (and all the extra/extended scenes are high quality, they just needed to limit the length of the theatrical version), the trilogy is basically like a multi-season show of the Netflix (or better, Amazon Prime!) era, which can be enjoyed in 20-30 minute viewings.Sienna's favorite characters of the trilogy: Gandalf, Legolas, and Aragorn; scariest characters: witch king, Mouth of Sauron

"malcolmjohnston","18 September 2023","22 years after its original release date I finally had the chance to see Peter Jackson's original lord of the rings epic on the big screen as a special run of all 3 director's cuts at our local cinema.I've been waiting this long as the first time around I was busy being a new Dad so this chance was just a must!Now much to the annoyance of my wife I already own all possible versions on DVD and Blue-ray and watch them at least once a year , so to say I'm a fan is putting it mildly 😀
Now getting to sit and watch them as they were made to be seen on a huge screen in comfy seats , bucket of popcorn 🍿 in hand was thrilling
If you've not seen this film by now
What planet are you living on?Secondly why are you reading this and not busy watching Lotr's Fellowship of the Ring?This movie is one of the top 10 movies of all time in my opinion
Even 22 years on and on a a big screen the special effects still stands up to modern releases and of course the story line the film is adapted from is the definition of a classic novelThe only real shame is the movie is a snap shot of how films should be and not as modern Hollywood is today churning out substandard epics that deserve the love and attention spent on this movie by its makers and it's amazing cast of actors.","

"Reviewer32","5 January 2024","I've watched this movie the first time it was released when I was young (my father took me to cinema theater in my hometown) and I watched it now in 2024 for the roughly of total 20th time during the past years until now. As I've made a longer pause between my last watch and this one, just to see whether this movie is really a masterpiece now that I'm older than before - and it fricking is! I cannot stress this enough. This movie has made my life better and more dreamy at times whereas it stands alone as one of the best cinematic experience (and overall artistic pieces) that made an impact on me. Moreover, for a great number of years I even didn't perceive it as a cimema (for example, forgetting to mention it as one of my favorite movies) but it felt almost surreal for me. At the moment, it is the nostalgia that hits the hardest with this last watch. I've recalled my childhood memories, emotions, imagination that I had after swallowing the fairytale content from this movie and everything that this masterpiece was delivering to me throughout all these years.Bravo movie!","

"ma-cortes","14 December 2022","Awesome , extraordinary picture with gorgeous frames and groundbreaking special effects. This is first part in Jackson's trilogy based on the novels written by the classic writer J. R. R Tolkien . This over-the-top film begins with Frodo (Elijah Wood) who inherits a mysterious ring from his uncle Bilbo (Ian Holm) , as he must leave his home in order to keep it from falling into hands of his evil creator . Along the way , a fellowship is formed : Gandalf (Ian McKellen) , Frodo (Elijah Wood), Pippin (Billy Boyd) , Sam (Sean Astin) , Merry (Dominic Monaghan) , Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) , Boromir (Sean Bean) , Legolas (Orlando Jones) , and Gimli (John Rhys Davies) to protect the ringbearer and make sure its final destination : Mt. Doom , the only place where it can be destroyed . The valiant group cares the Ring to transport it to Mt. Doom across risked and extremely perilous paths pursued by astonishing dark forces . Meantime , Gondor is invaded by the Orcs of Mordor and Aragorn falls in love for Arwen (Liv Tyler) . Later on , they travel to the creepy caves inhabited by the Army of the Dead and a spectral being . All of them suffering a lot of dangers , while fighting Saruman's (Christopher Lee) army of Orcs and Gollum/Smeagol (Andy Serkis) following/abetting and continuing the travel towards Mount Doom to destroy the powerful ring . One Ring and save Middle-earth from the Dark Lord Sauron . Even the smallest person can change the course of the future ! . Middle Earth comes alive...! All we have to decide is what to do with the time that we are given !. Power can be held in the smallest of things... One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them ! Its power corrupts all who desire it. Only one has the will to resist it. A Fellowship of nine must destroy it !. A New Power Is Rising !. The Battle for Middle-earth Begins! All will be sacrificed... All will be lost... Unless all unite against evil !.This sensational epic adventure is plenty of action , impressive battles , spectacular drama , plot twists , gorgeous exteriors from New Zealand and being pretty entertaining , in spite of about three hours runtime , while still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamilar with the lengthy literary work . The movie packs a real sense of wonder and stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown feats of the various protagonists and winding up in overlong battles and a stunning finale to be continued by two top-notch sequels . It contains incredible array of technical visual effects by Weta Digital and Weta Workship , among others companies . Sensational and colorful cinematography by cameraman Andrew Lesnie and long-standing as well as sensitive musical score by Howard Shore , winning deservedly Academy Award . Beautifully realized set design with phenomenal production values and lavishly produced by Harvey and Bob Weinstein . The film provides amusement enough during the three and half hour and stays closer to the novel than any of the former adaptations -mostly animated and in low budget- such as the mediocre effort by Ralph Baski . The motion picture will appeal to Tolkien followers as the neophyte who didn't have seen the subsequent parts . Stunning direction by Peter Jackson bringing competently the fantastic world and mythology of the great British author to life . Followed by ¨The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers¨ (2002) and ¨The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King¨ (2003) , all of them magnificently directed by Peter Jackson .","

There are a few sections of the book that were left out of the film and there is information in this first movie that isn't revealed until later in the trilogy of novels.  However, the movie is so well done, all is forgiven. Gorgeous cinematography, spot-on casting, lush score, and the right mix of sentiment, suspense, and comic relief.  I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in quite a while.  Brilliantly done!","

"martinpersson97","17 September 2021","Tolkien's Middle-Earth mythos has captured readers for many decades, and whilst a movie adaptation was inevitable, few dared to take it on.Enter Peter Jackson in 2001, a director most known for low-budget horror films and contemporary dramas - not one you would associate with an adventure movie on an epic scale, but you could not be more wrong.This movie, along with its sequels, stands as one of the greatest achievements in movie making of all time. Everything is perfect, the acting, the pacing and tone, the action scenes and of course, the visuals. It's without a doubt some of the best effect works ever seen.With an appropiate running time of 3 hours, or 4 if you watch the Extended Cut, it feels very true to the novel and on the same grand scale. The world-building is like nothing ever seen before and is very much the template for every fantasy world ever put on screen since.As mentioned above, the actors all do an amazing job, and make you feel for these characters, as little as they are in this grand world. There are a lot of funny and human interactions, that just adds even more to the sense that this is a real world - something Tolkien intended to allude to.Along with its two sequels and three prequels, this acts as the fourth chapter in an epic saga about the struggle against evil, that should best be experienced as a whole.","

"ackstasis","6 July 2010","Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (2001-03) is one of the most ambitious cinematic undertakings of all time (perhaps second only to Sergei Bondarchuk's ""War and Peace (1967)'), and played such an immense role in my adolescence that the two years I had to wait to experience its conclusion were as painful as they were gratifying. I'm about to take you on a trip down memory-lane, so bear with me. I first saw 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)' in late January 2002, long after everybody else I knew, owing to a family holiday that nevertheless allowed me to familiarise myself with Tolkien's primary Middle-Earth literature.I greatly enjoyed the novels, and have certainly re-read them since, but this movie was something else. I was immediately transfixed by its magnificent locations, exciting characters, epic scope, and, above all else, its attention to detail. Jackson's prologue gracefully traverses 3000 years of Middle-Earth history, settling finally on the halflings of The Shire, a race of little-people so satisfied with their quaint lifestyles that the goings-on of men and elves are of little consequence to them. It's this balance of the epic and the intimate that makes these films so special. Every time I watch 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' I notice something different: the three frozen trolls of Bilbo's tale; the hobbits' hairy, shoeless feet; the glowing of Frodo's ""Sting"" blade whenever orcs are close.Each of the film's characters remain true to Tolkien's original stories. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are self-doubting but courageous, as yet oblivious to the roles they will play in shaping Middle-Earth's history. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) projects incredible power and wisdom, but it is infused by the weariness of an old man, the mental ravages of millennia passed. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) is a valiant wanderer, and the last surviving member of a shattered royal bloodline, an ancestry that seems to affirm his own downfall. Supporting stars Sean Bean, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Dominic Monaghan, John Rhys-Davies, Liv Tyler, and Hugo Weaving round out the cast, each contributing their own spark of personality into this magnificent world of fantastic creatures and terrific evil.Peter Jackson has asserted that his favourite film is 'King Kong (1933),' a prime motivating factor in his decision to direct his own excellent remake in 2005. Both films capture the awe and wonderment of their respective fantasy-worlds, though 'The Lord of the Rings' is even deeper entrenched in a sort of historical mythology, fuelled by a Tolkien legendarium that seems to stretch far beyond even the film's epic scope. We're all inspired by something. I like to describe myself as an amateur filmmaker, a hobby I've maintained for the best part of ten years. I'd already picked up a video camera by the time I saw 'The Fellowship of the Ring' in January 2002, but my prolonged enthusiasm for film-making came from the realisation that movies could be this amazing.","

Peter Jackson has done the impossible in my opinion made a film that is better than Star Wars (which I never liked anyway). The action sequences are enthrailling, the scenery is beautiful and the storyline is so memorizing and attention grabbing you won't move from your seat. Elijah Wood is great as Frodo, he's my pick for Best Actor this year. Viggo Mortsen as Stryder is a solider in this movie, he just goes G.I. style the whole movie. I can't wait for the second movie and to see it again. **** out of ****.","

The Lord of the Rings is an immersive experience, taking you along a journey of emotions as you absorb the beautiful landscapes in New Zealand along with one of if not the most iconic scores in film history. Attention to detail in costumes is some of the highest quality seen in film history, and CGI still holds up to many modern movies and tv. While not an exact replication of the novels, LoTR is possibly the most perfect.","

"vip_ebriega","25 May 2008","My Take: Grand-scale epics at best. After plagued with much hype and anticipations upon release, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, the first of three adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic book series, is a highly satisfying and intriguing trip to a dark and yet magical new enterprise. New Zealand-born director Peter Jackson, like most of Hollywood's directors and producers, demand a great deal of money to create such project, but unlike others, Jackson has his own vision. He doesn't let the film blunder with too much special effects without first seeing what's more important, plot characters and storyline. With such great framework, it's no wonder why FELLOWSHIP is steady and strong.Firstly, the movie is filled with dazzling special effects. There are dozens of flashy advances on the effects. Now, we are able to create towers, civilizations, creatures, caverns, and many other locale and characters in grand scale. It's a convincing look at a terrific combination of miniatures, digital effects and the like. This is a grand motion picture achievement, and it's great to look at. This cost a lot to be sure, and it shows.But the movie isn't all flash and dazzle, it's also about characters and a story, and it doesn't water down Tolkien. His vision of Middle-Earth is wonderfully and respectfully visioned by Jackson, who takes his imagination to create it. The characters that populate the story are actually valuable. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his gang of Hobbits, and the rest of the Fellowship, comprise a surprising amount of friendship. These characters are a real fellowship, as we care about them, and what happens to them. The plot isn't tailor-made for Tolkien fanatics alone. The plot is easily explained and punctuated, and avoids much confusion.Although the adaptations of the follow-ups are more superior, it only shows that something great can actually be something even bigger. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is superb, epic-scale, with heart.Rating: ***** out of 5.","

"ja_kitty_71","5 April 2008","Tolkien's works were adapted for TV with animation by Rankin/Bass (1977 and 1979). In 1978, Ralph Bakshi brought the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now, with today's technology, an all-star cast, and a fabulous music score, New Line Cinema has brought the trilogy to a new level as a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21st century. Each scene has heart, a bit of humour, heart-thumping action, and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you that Rings is what got me to love four of the film's stars: Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, and Liv Tyler; she gives Arwen's first scenes her sultry voice.In ""Fellowship of the Ring"" I love the first scene after the prologue: Frodo was reading beneath a tree when he heard a male voice singing. He runs to see who it is and finds an old man (Gandalf), wearing a grey cloak and a pointy hat, driving a cart filled with fireworks and suchlike. When the cart stopped, Frodo said, ""You're late!"" Of course, Gandalf does not look at the hobbit at first and then turns slowly with an emphatic expression on his face that begins to twitch, and he says, ""A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to."" Then they both (he and Frodo) slowly began to grin and crack up into laughter, and then Frodo leapt on the cart and hugged the old man and said that he was glad to see him. Another scene from the film I like is when, after Frodo was stabbed and Arwen took him to her father in Rivendell, she faced the Ringwraiths at the Fords of Bruinen and cast a spell on the river to ""wash"" away the Ringwraiths. I also love the romantic bridge scene in Rivendell between her and Aragorn; they're my favorite book couple. I am fickle like that.","

"DarthBill","9 June 2004","The beginning of the great Lord of the Rings epic. The ring of power is discovered in the hands of hobbit man Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), the title character and hero of JRR Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"", who then passes it to his nephew Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood). The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) pulls a few strings to bring together the various races of Middle Earth to join in a quest to destroy the ring. Along the way many will fall and many will live, but the fate of the world all rests in the hands of Frodo and his companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin). Joining them is a burned out ""ranger"" who is actually the heir to one of Middle Earth's finest kingdoms, Aragorn, AKA: Strider (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean) the troubled son of the Steward of Gondor, elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Ghimli the dwarf (John Rhys Davies!) and two other hobbits, Merry and Pippin (Billby Boyd and Dominic Monaghan, respectively). And don't forget Gandalf the Grey.A great long road movie of a fantasy that could easily have been made boring is kept alive by the direction of Peter Jackson, who didn't stay nearly as close to the books as the inept Chris Columbus tried to stick to JK Rowling's Harry Potter books but somehow delivered a far better film, capturing the spirit and humanity of Tolkien's work. Wood is sometimes annoying and sometimes endearing as Frodo, so I give him a 6 out of 10. Astin, Monaghan and Boyd are all fine as the other Hobbits. McKellan and Mortensen shine as Gandalf and Aragorn, with Bean working hard to make you sympathize with Boromir even though may not like him. Davies makes the most of his Ghimli role while Bloom has little to do except stand around and look pretty. Hugo Weaving really stands tall as Lord Elrond of Rivendell (far more engaging than his Matrix work). As for Liv Tyler as Arwen, well, to me Liv will always be Bruce Willis's slutty daughter from ""Armageddon"". Liv's work here is fine, but I do feel that they were kind of using her face and name as a battering ram to propel the advertising campaign. She isn't bad but it's a shame that she overshadows the work of Miranda Otto as Eowyn in ""TT"" and ""ROTK"" and that Christopher Lee, who played the loathsome Saruman with such quiet malice, was cut from the 3rd film whilst Liv was kept in.Great sets, great costumes, great props, great locations, and great music by Howard Shore. Don't miss Enya's ""May It Be"". Look for odes to the animated versions of Lord of the Rings here.","

This movie does that in a very big way and really sets the mode for the following two movies. It is the hook and bait that is irresistible and even those that don't care for fantasy movies find themselves reeled into one of the greatest epic fantasy's ever told. Entering a world filled with new discoveries and incredible adventures is something that every child hopes for and thats exactly what sparked the creation of this epic. Watching this movie really brought me back to a time when life was magical and my imagination was all I needed to enjoy each day. Very few movies are able to immerse a person and make them feel very much apart of the story that is being told like this movie does.","

"jdkraus","17 December 2006","I've read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and absolutely love them. I never thought that such a fantasy could be brought to life on cinema, for it is such a challenge to film a movie off of one book (three in all) that has so much story, exotic locations, epic battle sequences on grand scales, and most importantly, strong character development.For those of you who don't know of Lord of the Rings, it is a simple tale of good vs. evil of a dark lord named Sauron, who has lost his powerful ring, which falls into the hands of a hobbit, Frodo (a creature that is small, cute, and furry feet), played by Elijah Wood, who gives a very powerful performance as the confused and determined hobbit, who sets out on a quest to destroy the evil ring and bring peace into the world. He is guided by a wise wizard played by Sir Ian McKellan who is a pure image of Gandalf (just like in the books).Peter Jackson, a well known, New Zealand director, not only captures the story, but brings to life. it is simply amazing. I have not seen such a beautiful and awestruck film ever for a very long time. The director brings the world to life with amazing production design, costumes, and visual effects that triumph over all other films to date. He also includes some awesome camera angels, which brings you, the audience closer to this magical world.The cinematography used was so astonishing, that it gave an intense feeling of emotion, that was incredible, reminded me very much of Braveheart, particularly with the fight sequences that were intense and highly action oriented, but it still holds a hint of blood and gore to it, but minimized it to a PG-13 rating. The score also gave this emotional feeling, especially with the characters that helps describe their moods which is: sorrow, courage, power, and above all engaging.it is an amazing, rare feat of movie-making that I have not seen in a long time. The film is: inspiring, enchanting, breath-taking, and captivating. Peter Jackson, as well as the rest of the crew has turned an ordinary fantasy tale into a unique film.Rating **** out of ****","

"dragokin","19 May 2013","When i heard that The Lord of the Rings would be brought to screen i was very excited, especially since i've seen the 1978 animation movie. Back in the day the trilogy hasn't been finished which wouldn't happen again.This is one of the rare occasions that a long anticipated movie fulfills it's expectations. Moreover, it set the such high standards for epic fantasy that it took a decade for them to be surpassed by The Game of Thrones (2011) TV show.If you haven't red J.R.R. Tolkien's book, you'd be taken by the world you'll discover in The Fellowship of the Ring. And if you have, i think you wouldn't mind any discrepancies from the literally template.However, the positive review concerns only the first part of the trilogy.","

"sethn172","20 February 2006","The 1970s have brought us ""Star Wars"" and this continued on throughout today. In the 1980s, it was ""Indiana Jones."" From the dusk of an old millennium to the start of a new one, many movies have garnered sequels which formed trilogies - ""The Matrix,"" ""Spider-Man,"" and this one - ""The Lord of the Rings."" From 2001 until 2003, three movies were released - one for each year (during the holiday season, of course): this one, ""The Two Towers,"" and ""The Return of the King."" This movie starts off slow, but then the tension and the excitement builds as we move on! This is one great aspect about the ""Lord of the Rings"" series.I've seen all three movies on DVD (the original versions), and I enjoyed them very much. Hopefully, you will too! Enjoy ""The Lord of the Rings!""","

"griffolyon12","14 March 2009","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is easily one of the most ambitious films ever made. The sheer scope of the film is enough to warrant a viewing from any moviegoer. Never before has the combination of CGI and live action footage been as superfluous as it was in this movie (this goes for all of the other films in the trilogy as well). Though what makes this film distinguished from the other two Lord of the Rings films is that this is the setup for all that is to come, so there is a certain level of mystery and intrigue to each action set piece. I think it is that intrigue that sets this one apart from the rest of the trilogy. When you view Two Towers and Return of the King, they are very similar in tone and style, but this one had a more different approach than those two, and this is also by and large because this one focuses more so on nine characters than entire nations as a whole. Another key difference between this one and the other two is that the action taking place in this film is more like a Golden Age adventure film in style, where as the action in the other two is modeled to be like epic war sagas.This film was masterfully directed by Peter Jackson, and the film is superbly acted by its wonderful cast, in particular Ian McKellen as Gandalf. After seeing this film it is easy to see why so many people are in love with these books. The world is so richly detailed that one simply gets lost in the overall scope and scale of its story.I give The Fellowship of the Ring a perfect 10 out of 10!","

One of my favorites and is my 2nd favorite out of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This movie is just a pure masterpiece with excellent visual effects, beautiful landscaping, and should be winner of best picture. The music of the movie from Howard Shore is superb like the opening theme and battle themes. The story of this film also is just so incredible. Thanks to you J.R.R Tolkien and Peter Jackson. The characters were phenomanel like Viggo Mortensen who played Aragorn, who is my favorite character. The story beat the whole trilogy. I would say so much more about this excellent film but I don't have much time. I love you Lord of the Rings!!! Oh, and did I say it was excellent10/10!!!! Highly Recommend, beautiful film","

"sol-","14 January 2005","A spectacular-looking fantasy adventure with the feel of an epic, but yet missing too much to truly rate as an epic. The cinematography is breathtaking (albeit it actually mostly computer generated), the makeup is admirable and some of the set design is really good, but yet in terms of screenplay it ultimately dull. Converting the first part of 'The Lord of the Rings' fantasy novel into a film seemed to be an impossible feat at the time of the film's production, as the books were full of so many essential details that they would not be satisfying without all the content. Nevertheless the producers went ahead, trimming things here and there, creating overall a good-looking film but one in which the events are unclear and the plot is too convoluted to be understood by anyone not familiar with Tolkein's novel. The concept of character developed is abandoned in the epic swoop of the film, creating a not very involving watch. The film is very lengthy, which should not be a problem in the best of epics, but in this one it just leaves a bad taste, as there is no reason to care what actually happens. The film indeed brews a tendency to bore at times, and the action sequences are not only mindless, but are too violent for younger audiences, which is a shame as the 'The Lord of the Rings' is excellent for enthusiastic young readers. On the other hand, there are a number of positives to the film, as it is technically interesting, but that is not enough to make it a very good watch  at the most it is an above average film, because it has some interesting elements. It is just a shame that the cinematic virtues of the film were not given more justice by the screenplay. The original cut was 270 minutes, and judged on the overkill length of this version, two parts to the film would have perhaps worked better. Or perhaps Tolkein's novels would have been better untouched by live action film.","

"braddugg","25 January 2016","The Lord of the Rings has changed the scope of fantasy films forever. The Fellowship of the Ring was just the beginning.This is a fantastic fantasy film and just a start yet.I have seen the trilogy 3 times and after nearly 10 years, I am revisiting the trilogy. Even now, if give me a thrill that is unparalleled. Now, I know what is going to come but still I wait for the unfolding. I am seeing this in awe and for appreciation of the caliber that was put in the making of these films.The fellowship gave details and the tone is perfectly right. There is a backdrop story that is explained so that those who have not read the book can understand what the story is all about. Why is the title named ""Lord of The Rings in the first place? Also, why is this part called ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".As we travel with the film, the mysteries and solved and we get a clear and bright picture of what the whole thing is about. I watch these films and am now revisiting them because in all these years I have not seen any fantasy film that has such great usage of graphics and keeps things real. The sky, the grasslands, the mountains, the marshes, the landscape everything seems real. Perhaps, all these exist in some part of the world today.The major part of the film was shot in Norther Islands of New Zealand and no film I believe I can capture or depict New Zealand's landscape as this film has done.Peter Jackson deserves all the kudos for translating a novel by the same name, into a near perfect film on celluloid.Perhaps, I will revisit this some time again. Till then 5/5. Thanks to all those, who made this film and this trilogy a possibility of such magnanimity.","

"action-6","3 February 2002","""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" has got to be one of the best, if not the best, movies ever made. Based on the superb novel by Tolkien, this film is a great story of the battle between good and evil. It contains elements that scare you, make you laugh and make you cry, and then it manages to be a totally unique movie. How Peter Jackson, the director of cult classics such as ""Bad Taste"", ""Meet The Feebles"" and ""Braindead"", managed to make a movie of such high quality is perhaps difficult to understand. One thing is certain, this movie rocks, and I can`t wait for the 2 next movies!!!10/10","

"yamagata@virtual-markets.net","18 October 2022","After watching Rings of Power, I have new appreciation for Peter Jackson's work. This work always has translated JRR Tolkien's vision of the characters and the book. It also reproduced the Hildebrand art work that was approved by the Tolkien estate and which grew to be synonymous with this work in my mind. They superbly casted all of the characters. The direction and the story boarding of the movie reflects and respects what was happening in the books perfectly in my mind. I was completely satisfied at the end of this move. So much so, that I went to the opening midnight showings of all of the following 3 movies.It must be said that Rings of Power had cinematography and costumes that rivaled the Peter Jackson work, but without the superior interpretation of the original material it is an inferior work.I may sound harsh in this review, but I read the Lord of the Rings on my own while an undergrad going to college. I did this because I understood that JRR Tolkien was writing and creating a new piece of mythology like those that have come down through the ages in a writing style befitting such a work. It is a great allegorical story for his time and is worth reading and understanding lest we forget the lessons of the past.","

"jhaggardjr","6 January 2002","""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"", the first movie in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, is a spectacular movie epic in every way. This film succeeds in all departments: acting, directing, writing, cinematography, editing, art direction, costume design, music score, sound, and special effects. You name it. The big name cast that takes part in this outstanding motion picture includes Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler, Ian McKellen, and Christopher Lee. They (along with others) play characters that were originated by J.R.R. Tolkien, the author of ""The Lord of the Rings"" books, and brought to life by director Peter Jackson (who shot this and the two ""Lord of the Rings"" sequels simultaneously in his native New Zealand). This, along with ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", stand head and shoulders above all the other 2001 movies. But I don't want to say that ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is the best movie of 2001 yet. Right now it is (with ""Harry Potter"" at #2), but there are still a few other 2001 releases that I want to see that I haven't seen yet (like ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Gosford Park""), so probably a month or two from now I will know for sure if this terrific fantasy/adventure will finish on top as my favorite movie of 2001. But what a fantastic movie this was.

"Al_The_Strange","5 April 2014","Fantasy fiction has always had an entrancing power, weaving elements of myth, magic, and folklore to tell grand stories that can stagger the imagination in ways other genres cannot. In novels, there is no limit to what imaginative worlds a writer can conjure, but in films it's never been an easy translation. For J.R.R. Tolkein's classic and influential Lord of the Rings trilogy, a big-screen adaptation was long considered unfeasible; even master filmmakers like Stanley Kubrick considered it ""un-filmable."" From the 1990s onward, with the advent of advanced special effects and better film-making tools, a director from New Zealand took up the challenge of creating the Lord of the Rings on film. The end product was a trio of truly epic, spellbinding films, the likes of which hadn't been seen since Fritz Lang's adaptation of Die Nibelungen.In the first act of this sprawling trilogy, we are immediately thrust into the lore of Middle-Earth, in a visually dazzling montage of scenes that brings us up to speed on the history of the One Ring. This prologue sequence is epic as it is, but the film moves on pretty briskly, introducing all the characters one-by-one and setting them off on an adventure. The fellowship is made to outrun peril at every turn, confronting wicked Black Riders, goblins, powerful orcs, dark magic, and even each other. Among the film's highlights, there's plenty of sword-swinging action, scenes of magic and whimsey, and breathtaking landscapes. My favorite sequence has always been the Mines of Moria, which is like a live-action dungeon-crawler, complete with myriads of orcs and huge monsters. Even in between the action and effects-driven scenes, the film is consistently entertaining thanks to its style, its quick-draw editing, and its focus on storytelling and characters.The film takes its liberties from the source material when it has to, but it is still pretty close to the original book. The film goes to great lengths to keep as much of Tolkein's work intact as it can, including the finer details of the locations, history, and folklore. Changes are mostly minor, and serve to fit the narrative into the film's three-hour runtime. The basic plot adheres to the original novel pretty closely, and all the key characters are properly represented. And it is a timeless story, utilizing the classic conventions of the epic journey to bring the characters from one dazzling encounter to another; very much the same manner of storytelling that made other classics like The Wizard of Oz so compelling. With Lord of the Rings, however, each encounter is a deep exploration of the Middle-Earth, and the film succeeds in submersing the audience in all its splendor. At the same time, the saga kicks off the end-all-be-all War of the Ring, which mirrors Tolkein's own observations of WWI and WWII, and is as much of a prevailing conflict on-screen as it is in the novels. Throughout the film, each character is given a chance to shine. There are also subtle traces of themes that prevail, concerning adventure, courage, and good-vs-evil.This film is crafted with excellent photography. A few shots are cheaply-cut, but otherwise, most of the editing is great. Acting is effectively perfect from the whole cast; Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen embody their characters so well that they became iconic as Gandalf and Aragorn respectively. Performances by Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Orlando Bloom, John Rhyes-Davies, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett, and Sean Bean are all really admirable as well. I also have a soft spot for Liv Tyler. Filmmakers went to great lengths to make everything look and feel real, including gorgeous locales, and a plethora of well-crafted sets, props, and costumes. Special effects show their age, but are still ambitious and wonderful to behold. Howard Shore's music score is one of the most beautiful compositions ever made for a film.The first time I watched The Fellowship of the Ring, I realized for the first time that this film embodied everything I ever wanted in films: the perfect marriage of entertainment, storytelling, and craftsmanship. It is a bold picture at times, but also an elegant one. Even though the sequels would have even grander spectacles to behold, this first film has its fair share of adventure, and it is quite the moving picture. All three films should be seen at least once in sequence, but one couldn't ask for a finer start to such an ambitious series.On home video, the Extended Cut of this film includes about a half-an-hour of extra scenes, many of which focus on events that would be relevant in The Return of the King. There are more scenes involving Gollum, and the sequence in Lothlórien is longer. I think this version has a better opening, showing more of Bilbo and the Shire. These are all pretty interesting scenes worth seeing.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect <> Story: Perfect <> Film: Perfect)","

"flicklover","2 January 2002","I went into this film expecting to like it, the buzz was good and the story is weel known. Little did I think that I would be blown away so much that I have not left a theater as excited about a movie since I was a kid after I saw Star Wars. Most people are focusing on the special effects, which are remarkable, but I think that the film succeeds on all levels,most fantasy films these days are fx extravanganzas and are entertaining, but are not remembered soon after, they are just fun video games. Peter Jackson must have really loved this story, alot of care went into the producing of this story. Yes it is an adventure,full of action and thrills, but it takes itself seriously,Jackson has created a whole world, not just a bunch of action set pieces. Star Wars in 1977 felt that way, earnest and completely emerses the viewer into its world, no movie since has had done that as successfully until now, Bravo to Mr. Jackson and everyone involved in the making of Fellowship. Finally a movie that will make a huge amount of money, but will actually deserve it! Run, don't walk to see it!","

"supertom-3","3 January 2002","As a fan of fantasy films since my child hood I have eagerly awaited this film since I first heard it was being released, I remember being read the books when I was younger and being enthralled although I remember nothing from them. Fantasy films have sets and costumes that build magical worlds that the audience can be lost in but of all of them bar Star wars, none have been exceptional and all flawed in some way. I like the sword and sorcery slant more than anything else but have never had a film that nowadays I could look at critically and call excellent. My favourite film of all time is Masters of the Universe, no other film filled me with such excitement as that did, but it is majorlly floored, other favourites include Legend a film that visually was breathtaking but that was about all it was. Anyway this is the complete article. Visually this is the greatest film ever from the sets, effects down to the amazing and groundbreaking effects. Some of the flowing camera movements are vertigo inducingly brilliant, an example could be the opening battle scene as the camera sweeps through hordes of battling soldiers falling off cliffs or bludgeoning each other as the camera takes us through the battle fields. Peter Jackson's direction is dynamic and at times breathtakingly brilliant. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end throughout this film, I was lost in middle earth for three hours thanks to Jackson's mastery, his imagination obviously running rampant in the designing of the characters, worlds etc based on nothing more than descriptive story telling and perhaps a few odd sketches. I am glad I decided not to bring in any popcorn or sparkling beverage as an unwelcome need to go pee-pee may have resulted in me wetting myself and the fellow viewers either side of me parting like the red sea from the subsequent whiff. Apart from the amazing visuals the films story is imaginative and engaging but what do you expect from a classic fictional epic like Tolkiens Lord of the Rings trilogy, and Jackson as far as I know has stayed faithful to the story but of course needing to cut down a few moments of the piece and of course these will go noticed by some to varying degrees of noticability because of course everyone has their own ideas of what parts of a book they have read is important compared to somebody else's opinion. What is great about Tolkiens world, and characters is they are universally compatible, you don't need to have read the books to fully enjoy this, its easy enough to pick up, good versus evil and we get an opening story telling about the rings creation as well as other things of importance. The actors are all well cast here, and all of them perform excellently. Elijah Wood is very good in the lead; he manages to hold the film together in such a big role where others may have lost it to the supporting cast. Ian Mckellan is also brilliant as the wizard Gandalf and others who impress are Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys Davies, and a very good Sean Bean in a key role and all the others in this film performed to a level bettering anything I have seen them in. Worthy of note are the two main females the gorgeous Cate Blanchett as the wise and at times scary elf queen, and the impossibly attractive Liv Tyler who must surely have silenced unfair criticism with this performance, she is exceptional in this. She is sexy, tough, gentle and she steals the screen whenever she is on it, simply said she looks hot! One person I have not yet mentioned is Viggo Mortensen who plays Aragon; he for me was narrowly the star of the film. Viggo makes an excellent action hero in this and his performance is outstanding, I genuinely believe he is worthy of Oscar consideration for this film. The only minor fault of the film I would say is the end, because being only a third of the story of course there is no conclusion so it ends all so suddenly. Like pulling a bottle of milk from a baby's mouth when he was only half done I felt mildly annoyed and desperate to see part two, and considering I have to wait a year, I became equally desperate to watch the film again. I do feel that a whole year is a lengthy time to wait and I can see it as nothing more than a marketing ploy to build demand and expectation for the sequel. Anyway Christmas time has once again become an exciting time for me thanks to the Lord of the rings trilogy. Also excellent about this film would have to be the ear poundingly good sound effects, they were astounding. This added to the feeling of the film and like for instance Gladiator this film is one you just have to see on the big screen. I give this a definite 10/10 and it is number one in my mind. What excites me the most is that the sequels are supposed to get better and better. Bring on number 2.","

This is solid and engaging the almost 4-hour runtime. I didn't understand some points like: Gandalf sending an untrained sam and Frodo away from Hobbiton with Saurons ring, why the elves didn't send more people like Arwen into the fellowship when they could be facing armies on their journey, why Gandalf didn't know what saurons ring was the whole time he knew bilbo etc. It's following the heroes journey structure but some deaths like Boromir's did catch me off guard.

"troyputland","2 February 2016","Some may think this a biased review, but I grew up reading J.R.R. Tolkien's books and watching The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I love them. They have everything I could possibly want out of a story. The Fellowship of the Ring encompasses nine companions; an elf, a dwarf, two men, a wizard and four hobbits (or halflings or small- folk). They're on the biggest fantasy-adventure ever to hit a book or screen; destroy a powerful ring so Middle-Earth (the land in which they reside) isn't covered with a 'second' darkness. The only way they can unmake what has been made is by throwing the ring into the fiery depths of Mt. Doom, but it's not an easy journey, as many troubles hit them, with the ring being a huge burden on ring-bearer Frodo (Elijah Wood). There's so many underlying themes that LotR has something for everyone; friendship, love, good vs. evil and facing unbelievable odds are just a few of them. What makes The Fellowship of the Ring so special is Peter Jackson's ability to draw us into a rich world that's a complete, visual masterpiece. CGI is used sparingly, the team behind the magic relying on costume, make-up and locations made from scratch. The script manages to push the story forward, yet give us time to know each member of the Fellowship. Howard Shore's score is unblemished, giving me tingles and poignantly touching in a way most music only tries to be. For a cast so big, you'd think someone would stand out, but not here. Everyone is superb. The Fellowship of the Ring is a perfect block-buster and start to a trilogy that will be very, very hard to beat.","

"Reviewer746","18 October 2022","Most who've seen Jackson's Lord of the Rings recognize it as a masterpiece, a near-perfect adaptation, and perhaps even a life-changing experience. Certainly a once-in-a-generation cinematic achievement. The film perfectly captures the tone, narrative style, and depth of worldbuilding of J. R. R. Tolkien through meticulous attention to detail, clever insertions of original dialogue, masterful props and practical effects paired with revolutionary, yet modestly implemented CG effects, a memorably soundtrack, and a love for the source material that simply seeps out of every frame.Jackson's entire LOTR trilogy is a treasure, but Fellowship is the undeniable crown jewel, one of the finest films ever made. What sets it apart from other installments in the fantasy genre to make it the greatest of all time?1) The Source MaterialAlmost every other installment in the modern fantasy genre is heavily derivative of Tolkien's work. Given that Fellowship is the perfect adaptation of the source material, the only way to make a better fantasy movie would be to have better source material. Good luck finding any.That said, I think Tolkien's passing benefited the film's chances of success. While he lived, he was inclined towards harshly criticizing adapters for the slightest deviations from his 'lore'. There is a version of the live action LOTR films that would have had Tom Bombadil and all the other silly, unedited digressions from the books, or that would have based its artistic style on Tolkien's watercolors instead of the much more visually captivating works of professional illustrators John Howe, Alan Lee, and Ted Nasmith.2) Love of the Source MaterialEvidently, the filmmakers weren't just cashing in on a proven franchise like modern adaptations. On the contrary, they were taking a massive risk because fantasy film up until that point had been a flaming mess. The creative directors and the crew at large had to have a lot of faith in and reverence for the source material to make a good movie. PJ approached the project in many ways like a documentary, wanting to capture the essence of the source without injecting his own tangential messaging.3) The Necessity of Practical EffectsThis can't be overstated enough - CG has ruined modern fantasy and historical film. In its current state, it is a time- and money-saving shortcut that produces worse results than practical effects. The harder the industry leans into CG, the worse movies are getting. The creativity that comes with having to use practical effects on a budget is totally lost when you can just hire a CG firm to use the latest software suite with at least theoretically infinite range. CG makes actors act in a void of undefined dimensions, their movements always perfect, lacking the subtle imperfections of the real world. Practical effects obviously don't guarantee a quality result - it's a risk, but you have a chance at greatness. CG is a cheap and reliable road to mediocrity which was realized in later LOTR films.Even before the LOTR trilogy was through, CG was rearing it's ugly head and becoming problematic for Jackson who started leaning hard into the latest tech as soon as it became available and the second and third movies suffered as a result. By The Hobbit it was game over. Fellowship is a masterpiece in no small part owing to the fact that PJ had no choice but to use practical effects.4) The Perfect Storm of InvestmentGiven the shoddy state of 90's fantasy film, the planets really had to align to bring in as much investment as PJ got for these films. This may never happen again, especially given the current trends towards the use of AI and CG in writing and production.","

"Michael Fargo","21 December 2001","I wasn't a big fan of Tolkien's work although I respected his achievement and scholarship (however tedious it might be to some of us). But to whomever gave this material to Mr. Jackson and permitted him to film it in the manner he has chosen and with the people he's employed, thank you.
I've seen many films in my 54 years, and this one brought surprise and wonderment with each and every moment. Congratulations to all involved.
I was familiar with Enya's song prior to seeing the film (an experience enhanced by seeing it in an Imax theater, if you have the opportunity to see it projected that large, it's worth any effort), but by the time the song was sung after the last images of the horizon stretching before the characters and the audience, I was as emotionally overwhelmed as I've ever been by a work of art. This movie is easily worthy of garnering ""the best"" of the year, and it's been a particularly great year for film and a sobering year on the home front. But, I would advise parents to use restraint in sending their children to this movie. If they aren't old enough to read the books, then they should probably skip the film.","

"hawkeye_pierce2","19 July 2002","...but gave it a 10 because the stunning visuals (and I don't just mean ""FX"" I mean actual retinal intake at the utter aesthetic level) made up for the tiny bit of creeping out I got from looking directly into Elijah Wood's face all movie (not kidding). Short of that, I am almost excited and giddy such a new movie has climbed to #4 all time (on IMDb at least) but frankly it earned it. Any movie almost as good as Rain Man (but in polar-opposite ways) deserves to be #4...(I too loved Godfather and especially The Shawshank Redemption, but Rain Man is arguably the greatest film ever for many, vastly different reasons). I digress, no one should miss Lord of the Rings and I'm just glad I caught it at the Blue Ridge in Raleigh 8mos after it premiered (seeing this for the 1st time on video/at home would have been my loss).","

"PetarNeo","16 December 2016","First movie of greatest trilogy ever created in movie history and it was a long but absolutely brilliant journey. Things are changing and darkness has been awoken so now Fellowship must survive all unexpected events and bring Ring to Mordor so it could be destroyed. Considering extended version of movie has a run time of 200min without credits it is a very long movie but while watching movie you don't feel that way. Brilliance of film maker Peter Jackson is amazing as he introduces us into a world of Middle-Earth without any trouble and simply doesn't miss a thing giving us complete movie with full picture of what will come later. Every one of the characters had it's purpose and served it well, so now nine companions are on journey through Middle-Earth being chased by Nazgul's and Orcs. Power of the Ring is also well portrayed with many many scenes from Gollum that is deformed and has disturbed mind so now Bilbo also shows in many times how his force is being drawn to dark. Boromir showed as weakest from the moment he saw Ring, he was being drawn to it but at the moment of his death he realized how messed up he was. Aragorn was magnificently characterized by Viggo and throughout movie it hits that he has great power and is destined to make great things. Also movie keeps sometimes light approach with couple totally funny moments and amazing cinematography. Vastness of lands is incredibly shown with large shoots taken and from all perspectives. Directing of Peter is miraculous and there was not even a slightly moment where you will feel like he failed, shifting between moods from calm to excited to calm again from scene to scene. 4/4","

"BadgerStorm4345","15 May 2020","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is my least favorite film of the trilogy and yet is one of my favorite movies of all time. This story is classic and was told perfectly through these films, this is the one that started it all off, introducing us and getting us emotionally invested in all of its great characters, whether we love, hate or fear the character. Music and CGI are incredible and make this stand the test of time. Acting can't go without Praise, it's some of the best acting I've ever seen.

"NORWOLF1","1 June 2002","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings is a movie for our times. If we look past the stunning visual effects, lush scenery, and spectacular action sequences, and listen to the wisdom of Gandalf and Galadriel we hear the quiet whisper of the true meaning of the film- heroism. The message of this film is that true heroes are not the great and powerful, but the everyday person placed unexpectedly into trying circumstances. What a message at this time in our country's history. On September 11th we saw normal, everyday peoples lives changed suddenly, unexpectedly. They were forced to be heroes, to work to save not only their own lives, but the lives of others too. As Gandalf says, we do not choose what times we live in, but we choose what we do with the time we have.Remember this theme and focus on Frodo's trials and perserverance whenever you watch this movie. Remember the loyalty and friendship of Sam. That is what this movie is truly about.Peter Jackson has created a visually stunning film, filled with action, yet rich with meaning. He has for the most part stayed true to the themes and sequences in the books. While he has changed some characters and scenes, those changes do not significantly alter the plot and in some instances actually improve it.Though the movie is played out on a grand scale, the film is really about a story of one little hobbit, Frodo, and his unexpected challenge of having to be a hero.The score by Howard Shore is superb, quite worthy of the Oscar it received. The score is destined to become a classic.The cinematography is also superb, also definitely worthy of its Oscar.My one criticism, is that Saruman is given more time on screen than in the books. I felt he should be more so behind the scenes as he was in the books. The more sinister evil is the evil that cannot be seen. Though Christopher Lee, as always, is superb.The rest of the cast is also superb, especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Elijah Wood as Frodo. Kate Blanchett and Liv Tyler are also excellent in their roles, bringing a strong female presence.","

"anpwxcat","13 April 2002","Growing up, my dad would always tell me his favorite books were The Lord of the Rings volumes.  But I was never interested in fantasies, so I didn't really care.  Then I found out that Peter Jackman was making the movies so I told my dad.  He became really excited.  But still, I didn't care.  Until one night in November, when they showed the LOTR special on TV.  I was able to catch only the first ten, fifteen minutes and instantly, I wanted to see the movie.  I had never read the books.  My dad took me and my family to see the movie.  I was a bit excited and curious to see how they would do it. Mind you, I knew next to nothing about this story.I sat through the entire three hours in Middle Earth and fell in love with it. Through parts, I would clutch on my brother's arm, tense and hoping that everyone will make it through a lot of the sticky situations they were in. I fell in love with Legolas and his graceful Elf self.  The minute the movie began, I was drawn in.  The special effects were terrific.  I felt like I was there.  I wanted (and still do) to live in Rivendell among the Elves. The backdrops for the movies was fantastic.  Sir Ian McKellan's quote about how New Zealand is Middle Earth is so true.I was very impressed with the casting.  I'm a huge movie buff so I have seen plenty of movies and I won't be lying when I say that LOTR has the best casting ever.  Every person, the mains and the extras, WAS the character they played.  The make-up was incredible.  The orcs creeped me out.  The Elves entranced me.  The Hobbits brought a smile to my face.  Elrond, Hugo Weaving, is the perfect Elf King, firm and commanding, yet with love for his people and respect for Frodo.  I could go on and on, but I won't.I loved the fact how PJ was able to make the Hobbits look small in every single scene.  I would LOVE to know HOW in the world they did that.  I love how the Elves are so graceful and look ethereal.I know that the movie is three hours long and people balk at that.  I took a friend of mine who hasn't seen the movie because it was three hours long. He loved it.  He was engrossed and he had never read the book either. This movie is one of the, if not THE, finest piece of work I have seen.  I eagerly await ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"".  I definitely recommend this movie for everyone to see at least once.  I have seen it four times and will see it yet again soon.  I can never get bored of this movie. Go.  See it.I leave you with a quote from Gandalf: ""All we have to decide is what to do with the time that we are given""","

"MF210","21 April 2004","My Rating: **** out of ****. The first time I saw this film in the theater, I really did not see what the big deal was. I mean I liked it but I was a bit bored while watching. The second time I saw it, I liked it much better but I still did not find it to be the masterpiece everyone said it was. Well, the third times the charm. The movie shined like it never had on the previous viewings. Its a masterful piece of filmmaking. I will be honest, I have not read the Lord of the Rings books. Also, Fantasy has rarely interested me. I mean I read the Harry Potter books but by the end of the third book, I was tired of them. I may read the Lord of the Rings books sometime in the future but it won't be something I will be terribly excited by. If I read the books, it will be because the movies have improved so much on repeated viewings (except for Return of the King which I was only able to see once). The Fellowship was extremely successful when it came out. 13 Oscar Nominations (won 4 of them), Grossing 860 Million Dollars Worldwide, and I don't know how much its made on DVD. Thats pretty damn good and the amazing thing is that its the first part of a hugely successful trilogy.Its hard to say what works best here. Everything is blended to perfection(or close to it). Peter Jackson's direction is stellar. He paces the film perfectly by never rushing anything. When it wants to exhilirate us, it does. When it needs to take its time, it does. The action sequences are also masterfully executed. Jackson said his dream was to do Lord of the Rings for the screen. Well, it shows in every frame. Although Jackson is not the best director around, it would have been a huge mistake for any other director to do Lord of the Rings. His achievement here is masterful to say the least.
Technically, Lord of the Rings is flawless. Sets, Costumes, and Make Up(which won the Oscar) are perfect. The Oscar Winning Cinematography is stunning (I need to go to New Zealand soon). The Visual Effects are some of the most impressive of the 21st Century and were damn well worth the Oscar. The Sound and Score(which also won an Oscar) are also top notch.
The cast was well chosen. Elijah Wood is effective as Frodo. As is Sean Astin as Sam. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd do nice jobs as Merry and Pippin. Most of the actors do effective jobs but there are three standouts. Ian Mckellan turns in an excellent performance as Gandalf. Ian Holm(who has always been a top-notch actor) is completely credible as Bilbo. Finally, Christopher Lee makes a perfect villain as Sauruman. The Fellowship of the Ring is an amazing accomplishment for everyone involved. Jackson has crafted a masterpiece that is already being considered a modern classic. Jackson has every right to be proud of this film.","

This movie follows Frodo Baggins who has been sent on a mission to destroy the powerful one ring.Through and through this cast is amazing. Elijah Wood takes on this highly important role and does an amazing job with it and his chemistry with Sean Astin is great and as the primary relationship it works great. Ian McKellen plays the great Gandalf and is phenomenal in this role. Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, Viggo Mortensen, across the board this movie is perfectly casted.The writers do an amazing job with building this world. This movie has such a huge world that it could've gone very wrong and felt overwhelming but the writers do a great job of introducing us to this world at pace that allow us to understand it.Howard Shore created an amazing score. Each song fits each scene beautifully and all of them sound beautiful. The cinematography is gorgeous.

"CrassActionHero","10 December 2006","The first chapter. The Fellowship of The Ring (2001) No big spoilers. I'm just being safe.LOTR is an amazing movie. Peter Jackson has brought the tales to life. This is the best way to do it. Never has the imagination been so glorious. To experience this, it's surreal. This is a work of art.LOTR features a great cast to majestic fantasy. The realm of Middle Earth never looked this good. LOTR has a compelling performance by Elijah Wood as Frodo, the hobbit who is forced to deliver the evil ring. Ian McKellen is excellent as the Grey wizard Gandalf. He has such conviction.The action is stunning. My favorite is the battle at Moria. The imagery of the Fellowship taking on the goblins and a gigantic cave troll is just stunning. It looks so real. I am impressed. The visual of the Balrog is amazing. That has got to be the best, most menacing looking demon ever in the movies. The shrieks of the Ring Wraiths are eerie. Those shrieks are piercing. The wraiths are tormented and evil, the shrieks here are perfect. The best shrieks for a tormented being.The Last Word: LOTR is amazing like I say. There appears to be a following on hating this. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I just can't believe someone does not enjoy this. LOTR is stunning. Highly Recommended.","

"priyantha-bandara","8 February 2012","Though the western critics don't seem to be favoring this movie that much for some reason, for me it's totally 'Oscar worthy'. The plot is all about one word and that cruelty. We all have seeing fictional evil men starting from Darth Vadar to Saruman and Lord Voldemort. But in this movie you will come across the father of all evil Uday Saddam Hussain, the sadistic son of late Saddam Hussain. A very disturbing yet downright perfect movie making based on real life events that took place in Iraq before the republic fell in to ashes. More than fantastic performance by Dominic Cooper doing both Uday and Latif's characters.Every movie cannot be in the Oscar nomination top 10 list. But it can be in your mind forever.

"A_Voice","15 January 2014","Years ago when I first saw this film, that too without any knowledge of the plot and without reading the books, I expected it to be a normal fantasy franchise with loads of CGI. But when I actually watched it, I was hooked to my seat and completed the 11 and a half hour trilogy in one sitting (Extended edition, mind it!). It is a kind of the movie that needs to be re watched time and again to be understood completely. I was so influenced with the films that I started reading about various characters on the internet and finally decided to read the books including the Hobbit. And then I realized how well adapted this franchise really is!!.The story begins with the introduction of the war of Sauron and the forging of all rings. The one ring which was thought to be lost is rediscovered and the Dark Lord rises again to re claim his lost treasure. An unlikely fellowship is formed to go on an unlikely never before held quest.Many critics criticize the length of the film, but after actually reading the books, one realizes it couldn't have been shorter. After every viewing it discloses something new, some references that were previously unnoticed and are a delight for the the book readers. Like the references to Smaug at the start, the undying lands Valor etc. The list goes on and on.It fairs even better as a stand alone film. If Tolkien was alive, Jackson's vision of middle earth and its characters certainly would have made him proud. With some excellent sets, locations and character designs and visual effects including sound and original score, it was probably the best film on a technical front in years. Each character constructed with minutest of detail. The Balrog managed to strike fear in the viewers eyes as much as it did to Gandalf The Grey. The fair Elves who are the most beautiful creatures on middle earth. The film has some extremely good cinematography.As the story itself is more of a adventure, thus it lacks character development and is less of a character driven story but more of an event driven. Also, there are many character so one can't focus on each of them for all the time. But traces are there in Gandalf's, Sam's or Gimili's characters which have been developed quite a bit. Ian portrays an awesome performance and he is ""Gandalf"".Direction: Excellent and flawless.Story/Screenplay: Couldn't have been better. Extraordinarily awesome.Acting: Ian was best, Sean was good. Others were convincing.Music: One of the best musical scores ever. It is haunting when it has to be, charming when it needs to be and fitting all the time. Shore has done an excellent job creating the score and incorporating it with chants which have a 'mythological' feel to them, just splendid.Probably the best possible start to an extraordinary trilogy.","

"Alexander Christie-Miller","25 June 2002","'The Lord of the Rings' is one of my favorite books, I have read it several times, and remember thinking the last time, about 3 years ago that if I made a film I'd want to make it of this, but wouldn't it be almost impossible. You can then imagine how strong my expectations were when I went to see the eagerly awaited first installment. This film impressed me hugely, more than anything else because of how true it was to my imagination, both in the characters as well as in the effects and setting- a sentiment I have heard consistently from other fans of the books. Elijah Wood brought across the character of Frodo with the kind of haunted, frail courage that Tolkien captures so well in the books. Nor could I find any fault at all with Ian McKellan's Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn, and Sean Bean's Boromir, all of whom I thought were portrayed excellently. I could pick out instances where I did think, 'no, that's not right', however their seldomness in number would only serve to illustrate the excellence of the overall portrayal. One thing that did stand out for me was Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel, the part itself became so perfunctory in the film that to me her alternation between benevolent seer, and figure of potential terror seemed little more than a slightly confusing detour with no real connection into the plot other than as a vehicle for a glimpse into the future. But that was it.I thought that the points where Jackson did deviate from the text were completely the correct ones to do so. Shortening the opening Shire scenes and cutting out the whole Tom Bombadil bit was great since frankly they bored me slightly in the book anyway. Also, expanding the role of Arwen was a sensible decision. However this film is by no means above criticism. The dialogue was in my opinion terrible and purely there to drive on the plot. Normally this would ruin a film for me (as in ""The Matrix""), making it almost intolerable to view, however fortunately here it proves little more than a minor irritation. Also, the film seemed overall to be excessively plot-driven and at times a mad dash from one action scene to another, the characters, for all their truth to the book did seem flat and sometimes little more than stereotypical fantasy characters. This is perhaps my major quarrel with the film- I would have liked these characters to have come alive as people in a way that was made impossible by the sparseness of the script and the rollercoaster nature of the plot. In general the whole film lacked the depth of context that I think distinguishes Tolkien from other fantasy writers. However to have achieved this would have required a very different movie, and you can't fault an action film for being an action film. This movie is undoubtedly not for everyone. A lot of people just don't get fantasy- other than Lord of the Rings, I don't particularly either. However in my opinion Jackson really has made an incredible achievement- his and Tolkien's vision carried through suberbly by a breathtaking setting and stunning special effects, as well as by a cast clearly as enthralled as he was. He has taken on a huge task, and is dealing with it with breathtaking success.","

"quinimdb","26 May 2016","This film is beautiful not only because of its fantastic action scenes and special effects, but the three dimensional characters that present us with this deeply human story.The film is about how the people that persevere are not the ones with power, or even physical ability, but the ones who have the will power not to conform. This doesn't mean the heroes of this story are perfect by any means, they all have their flaws. The characters all have a sense of vulnerability, which is important for the tension in the action scenes, but it also shows that they're not perfect and not invincible. We see Frodo taking long periods of time by himself. We see how he is tortured and tempted just like the rest of them, and everyday for him is a struggle. Aragon can't escape the horrible shadow left by his father, who could've destroyed the ring when he had the chance, but decided not to. Gandalf seems wise and powerful at first, but the truth is, he doesn't know everything, and there are other evil ones that have more power than him. Sam is worried and timid. Boromir is also tempted by the ring, and it drives him to nearly kill Frodo. Alright, I could go on and on about all of the characters in the movie and what makes them unique and what drives us to care about them, but the point is, what drives them is their care for one another. It's what gives them the courage to go on and, in many scenes, it's what saves their lives. They're not invincible with each other, but without each other they wouldn't get anywhere. This is reflected in the incredibly tense action scenes, such as the one with the big orc, and the one on the staircase. This is something all of the characters learn by the end of the movie. Sam puts Frodos life above his, and gains courage from their relationship, and Frodo finally realizes that he needs Sam. Alone he would be tortured, but with Sam, it gives him hope.There is obviously much more that happens in this 3 hour long movie, but every single scene either contributes to plot or character, and the pacing is so good that the film feels like 2 hours. I wish I could get into every reason why this movie is so fantastic but that would take way too much time and too many words, so just watch the movie.","

The aerial footage, the makeup, the acting, the dialogue, the action, the score, the suspense! Does any movie have it like these movies do? I truly hope directors and producers in the future put as much effort as they did to these three movies, along with the new series set to premier September 2nd on Amazon Prime.

"Paynebyname","21 November 2002","Let me start by saying that I've never read the books. During my childhood I belonged to the legion that read the works of Tolkien's friend and rival, C S Lewis and the Narnia Chronicles.  They got my imaginative juices flowing and I stepped over Tolkien's work.  The films came out and I had been aware of Peter Jackson's work but with all the furore and lack of money at the time I held back from seeing it for at least two months. Eventually I watched it, enjoyed it but it didn't set me on fire.  My favourite scene, Boromir's last stand, lingered in my mind and over time the desire to see it again grew.  The DVD came out and I looked forward to sitting down with my to brother (who had not seen it) to watch again. Wow ! 2nd time around this thing blew my mind.  Whether it was because I then knew the story and could enjoy the characters and appreciate everything else I don't know but it just rocked my world.  I was like a love sick pup with a constant smile on my face enjoying every scene.  I tell you this tale to qualify my praise and make clear that I wasn't a tolkien fan from the start.Peter Jackson has opened my eyes to this world.  I don't know how faithful he's been (and I don't really care) but you can tell from the passion involved and the love heaped on this film that he takes it seriously and is not out to make a fast hollywood buck.  I purchased the normal DVD and recently got the extended version which is even more fantastic. I don't feel cheated and owning both is worth every penny.  The film itself is great.  The characters are rich and full, well written and well acted.  I can't really say I have a favourite but Gimli definetly comes out better in the extended version and I am looking forward to seeing his developing friendship with the others and his painfully sweet adoration of Galadriel.  The relationship between Boromir and Aragorn is very well played, again displaying real depth and makes Boromir's sacrifice and Aragorn's renewed faith in man all the more powerful.  In fact the film deals with the whole range of human emotions and knowing that they will be developed even more over the course of the next two films just warms your heart. The action scenes are great and with real time invested in the characters you feel all the more tense and involved.  The world Jackson has created is lush and wonderful with special effects serving and enhancing but NOT dominating the story.  The musical score is perfection, complimenting the film at every turn.  Indeed my favourite scene with Boromir owes much of it's brilliance to the beautiful music that accompanies it.  I am wrapped up in this world and although desperate to see the next two am also slowly savouring the whole heady experience.  For those that haven't got it I cannot recommend the extended version enough, it takes what you love and just adds more.In summary this film is a joy to watch and Peter Jackson's direction and story telling is assured and confident.  For the first time ever I'm preparing myself to enter a theatre and observe two films without any thoughts of whether I could have done it better.  I have total confidence in Peter to deliver what I need to see and knowing his cast & crew's passion for the project I know they will deliver.  It took me time to appreciate this beauty and elevate it to my favourite all time film but sometimes you have to step back and look again to observe real genius.","

"Starbuck-13","21 December 2001","Breathtaking!Pete Jackson did it! This movie is so extraordinary that it is hard to describe with words alone. It is thrilling, frightening, spine-chilling and exciting from the first moment on.This was the most intense movie experience since I went to see ""Return of the Jedi"" in 1983, then being a 11-year old boy. ""The fellowship"" simply blew me away, drove me to the edge of my seat more than once. My girl-friend was totally exhausted, saying that she felt like she herself would have walked with the fellowship over the mountains and through the mines - and the last half hour, she only wanted to say ""stop, I cannot walk any further, I'm totally worn out!!!"". For me, knowing the book, the film still was physically strenuous, but I just could not stop adoring the wonderful pictures and the sensational cinematography.Everybody will have his favorite moments in this movie. Mine were the escape from the black riders in the first part and Boromirs fate in the second. No spoilers here, but Sean Bean was fantastic! And I had to calm down my girl-friend during the Troll sequences at Moria - and many more times during the spectacular end...I am very glad that the movie, unlike many others, more than lived up to the hype.Those hours were among the most exciting movie hours I ever had, and I can't wait to see the next two parts. Hard to wait til Christmas 2002!!!","

Most people love it, a lot of people hate it, and some just don't know what to make of it. I don't think I have ever seen a film with such a huge range of differing opinions. People say it won't stand the test of time? but considering the book was writing 50 years ago LOTR has already stood the test of time. As far as the film is concerned IMHO its one of the best films I have ever seen and in 3 years time when we can sit down and watch all three movies back to back I am sure a lot of people who didn't like the first film for various reasons complaining about the lack of character development and a ending will more than likely change there opinions and will start to look on the LOTR trilogy as a true classic.","

You can then imagine how strong my expectations were when I went to see the eagerly awaited first installment.This film impressed me hugely, more than anything else because of how true it was to my imagination, both in the characters as well as in the effects and setting- a sentiment I have heard consistently from other fans of the books. Elijah Wood brought across the character of Frodo with the kind of haunted, frail courage that Tolkien captures so well in the books. Nor could I find any fault at all with Ian McKellan's Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn, and Sean Bean's Boromir, all of whom I thought were portrayed excellently. I could pick out instances where I did think, 'no, that's not right', however their seldomness in number would only serve to illustrate the excellence of the overall portrayal. One thing that did stand out for me was Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel, the part itself became so perfunctory in the film that to me her alternation between benevolent seer, and figure of potential terror seemed little more than a slightly confusing detour with no real connection into the plot other than as a vehicle for a glimpse into the future. But that was it.I thought that the points where Jackson did deviate from the text were completely the correct ones to do so. Shortening the opening Shire scenes and cutting out the whole Tom Bombadil bit was great since frankly they bored me slightly in the book anyway. Also, expanding the role of Arwen was a sensible decision.However this film is by no means above criticism. The dialogue was in my opinion terrible and purely there to drive on the plot. Normally this would ruin a film for me (as in ""The Matrix""), making it almost intolerable to view, however fortunately here it proves little more than a minor irritation. Also, the film seemed overall to be excessively plot-driven and at times a mad dash from one action scene to another, the characters, for all their truth to the book did seem flat and sometimes little more than stereotypical fantasy characters. This is perhaps my major quarrel with the film- I would have liked these characters to have come alive as people in a way that was made impossible by the sparseness of the script and the rollercoaster nature of the plot. In general the whole film lacked the depth of context that I think distinguishes Tolkien from other fantasy writers. However to have achieved this would have required a very different movie, and you can't fault an action film for being an action film.This movie is undoubtedly not for everyone. A lot of people just don't get fantasy- other than Lord of the Rings, I don't particularly either. However in my opinion Jackson really has made an incredible achievement- his and Tolkien's vision carried through suberbly by a breathtaking setting and stunning special effects, as well as by a cast clearly as enthralled as he was. He has taken on a huge task, and is dealing with it with breathtaking success. Check for other user comments.","

"Kirasjeri","8 March 2002","I just want to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this great film. It is clearly the best movie of the year, and if ""A Beautiful Mind"" wins the Oscar it will be due to internal Hollywood politics - how Miramax's ""Shakespeare in Love"" beat out the superior ""Saving Private Ryan"".In all aspects of movie-making, ""Lord of the Rings"" stands out: direction, special effects, sets, acting, and even the script. Parts of the Tolkien classic have been very nicely compressed, or expanded - such as the fight with the cave troll (barely in the book). As for FX, it doesn't get better than the jaw-dropping fight against ther Balrog on the bridge at Khazad-Dum.There was no performance that was not at least good, and the dialogue between Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee I thought especially effective. Cate Blanchett was luminous as Galadriel. The musical score deserves special note. It added extremely well to the drama and mood of the film, along with taking us into a magical realm.The entire film was magical. And I can't wait for the sequels!","

"bannonanthony","18 November 2002","I had not read any of the LORD OF THE RINGS before I saw the film series, and I still have not read it but I think that Peter Jackson has done a superlative job in bringing the story of the three books to the screen. My family now owns all of the extended editions of the three films on DVD, and while the original theatrical cuts weren't too bad at all, I'm glad to have seen the extra footage.The performances are all fantastic. Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are both excellent as the two wizards. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are great as main hobbits Frodo and Sam, Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean throw in great performances as Aragorn and Boromir respectively, THE MATRIX's Hugo Weaving is great as the Elf King and INDIANA JONES' John Rhys-Davies is great as the dwarf Gimli. This first film is of course all about establishing the characters and what they have to do, and it is handled well. I can see why it was unsuitable for children below a certain age, because for children things like the Orcs, Uruks, Ringwraiths, the Balrog and, in his brief appearance in the flesh, Lord Sauron himself are the stuff of nightmares. But the story is engaging and the characters all fully-rounded.I regret that unlike TWO TOWERS and RETURN OF THE KING, I never saw FELLOWSHIP in the cinema, but I still love it. It's unfair though to try and pick a favourite out of the series because each part is brilliant in its' own right. But FELLOWSHIP is an excellent beginning to the series and not to be ignored.","

"rooboy84","16 March 2002","After it was out for about 2 weeks, I finally decided to go and watch this film, as many people were saying how it wa the greatest film ever. I thought I wouldn't be interested in this type of movie, but boy was I wrong. The special affects took my breath away, the acting was sensational, the plot excellent...well not even words can really describe this film. The lord of the rings made me feel I was there with the characters. Very imaginative and unique as well. You must see this movie before dying! 10/10 Only downside is poor character development.","

"joshuadrake-91275","15 September 2015","I decided to do something new with this movie review. I will not only review the first film, I will review the entire trilogy. The plot follows Frodo Baggins as he goes on a journey to destroy the One Ring and with the help of the Fellowship and his friend, Samwise Gamgee and the evil / good creature Gollum, he is able to destroy the One Ring in the one place that he is created: Mount Doom.I love this trilogy and to this day, I think it is one of my favorite trilogies (others include The Matrix trilogy, the original and prequel STAR WARS trilogies, THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY and the original X-MEN trilogy), but I really thought that this trilogy was amazing and Peter Jackson gets a lot of praise for this film, King Kong, Tintin and the Hobbit trilogy and it is really amazing.The first 2 films are nearly three hours long, but the last film The Return of the King is 3 hours and 20 minutes long and I thought that would be way too long, but after the find ended I was not angry or bored.When I first watched The Fellowship of the Ring, it kept me interested and very amazed from beginning to the end, after that I watched The Two Towers, and it kept me emotionally engaged until the end credits and I was impressed with the climactic fight scene at Helm's Deep, then I finally got to The Return of the King and I could have not been happier with this one, it not only made a billion dollars when released in the theaters, but it won all 11 Oscars including Best Picture, making the third film the only fantasy film to win in each category.Not only you can get interested in the movies, you can also get interested in the characters and action, as well as the plot. Frodo is a cool character, played by Elijah Wood and his performance is amazing. Ian McKellen as Gandalf the White / Gandalf the Grey is really cool and amazing, he is a character that he is amazing, and his performance was great and I was angry that he did not get an Oscar for this role. Also, he was playing Magneto during production of the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the first, second and third X-MEN films.The character I was horrified about the first time I saw this film was Gollum, because of his split personality between Smeagol and Gollum and it was amazing to see him on screen, Andy Serkis played him and I liked him as Gollum in this trilogy and the first film in THE HOBBIT trilogy, An Unexpected Journey (2012), which was released in December 2012 and I did see it and I did see the second film and I really enjoyed it. My favorite scene is where Gollum is talking to himself and that was really funny and just well acted by Andy Serkis and this would lead him into playing the title role in Peter Jackson's KING KONG 2005 remake and Caesar, later on in RISE of the PLANET of the APES and DAWN of the PLANET of the APES and I can't wait to see him as Caesar in the next ""Planet of the Apes"" reboot film.These movies have some fantastic dialogue and action, especially in the second and third film. Every battle in this trilogy is amazingly well-done and spectacular and the added great CGI for this film trilogy.My favorite battles in The Fellowship of the Ring are when Arwen (played by Liv Tyler) saves Frodo and the battle inside Balin's Tomb and that was incredible and spectacular. My favorite battle in The Two Towers is the very, very, VERY long battle at Helm's Deep, that battle sequence was amazingly well-done. My favorite battle in The Return of the King is the end battle because there are two things happening: Frodo destroying the Ring and fighting Gollum and the entire Fellowship fighting against the Orcs.The cinematography, visual effects, production design, creature design, make-up effects, editing, musical score and atmosphere of this movie was an amazing job and it was also incredible and the direction by Peter Jackson is amazingly well-done and fantastic.Overall, this trilogy of films are incredible with every movie released and every time I watch these films are incredibly amazing. Yes, I will always love The Fellowship of the Ring for starting this trilogy, but The Two Towers is amazing and is a great improvement over the first film. My favorite one is the trilogy is The Return of the King, because it has better character development, better action sequences, better acting, better music and visual effects and most of all, the best ending to a film trilogy. I know a lot of people think that the ending is way too long in the third film, but I'm used to watching three to four hour long films at all. This is one trilogy that I don't think gets enough critical praise and credit.FINAL SCORE FOR ALL THREE LORD OF THE RINGS FILMS: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - 8/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - 9/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - 10/10 FINAL SCORE for the entire trilogy will be a 9.5 / 10","

"jlspenc-84630","10 June 2023","J. R. R. Tolkien was my dad's favorite author. Among the many, many books taking up space on his bookshelf was ""The Lord Of The Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"". In the case of the former, Dad had a tattered paperback of all three volumes condensed into one massive tome amassing over a thousand pages. But it wasn't just the novels that decoratedhis reading area; long before STAR WARS made the merchandising of popular entertainment fashionable, Tolkien calendars were printed for his multitude of devoted readers to collect. I distinctively remember one such copy was from 1973, the year Tolkien died.The movies showed an interest in adapting ""The Lord Of The Rings"", but the fantasy genre wasn't an easy story to put on film. In the late Seventies, a two hour, semi-animated version came out that gutted much of the story and ended with The Battle of Helm's Deep, which we all know reached the two-thirds mark in the book. To truly do justice to Tolkien's magnum opus would require a huge budget and, most importantly, the state of the art technology to bring his vision to life.Towards the end of the 20th century, New Line Cinema announced their acquisition to the rights of ""The Lord Of The Rings"". The intention was to film all three volumes at once starting with THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, to appear in December 2001, with THE TWO TOWERS and THE RETURN OF THE KING to be released over the next two years. It was the biggest gamble in cinematic history, a gamble of undeniably epic proportions because if FELLOWSHIP flopped, then there would be zero revenue to be had from the two follow-ups leading to losses of hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.To handle the massive logistics of THE LORD OF THE RINGS would require a James Cameron or a Ridley Scott, but New Line ended up pulling a true wild card out of left field: New Zealander Peter Jackson. He was virtually unknown to North American audiences, but the powers-that-be were so impressed with Jackson's storyboards that they felt his hiring was worth the risk ~plus, someone eager to establish their reputation will go the extra mile. I what would be a very profitable ~in more than just the monetary sense~ relationship with Weta Workshop, Jackson had an immense workload ahead of him, from the Cgi to the costumes to the screenplay he would adapt with wife Phillipa Walsh.","

"philcooper","19 December 2001","There's a very obvious problem when transferring any book to the big screen, namely that some of us may already have seen it. It's not that the story holds no surprises (save for the occasional controversies that surround the fate of characters like Hannibal Lecter), it's just that many of us have already read the book, and thus we've already directed our own version of the story. We've already seen it in our mind's eye. And this is the problem that plagues The Fellowship of The Ring. You'll see a lot of reviews here proclaiming it as nothing short of the second coming of cinema, and a few that dare to knock its serious shortcomings. Let me clear this up right now. The first issue that many may raise is that this is not a faithful adaptation of the book. Quite right, while taking pains to ensure that they stayed faithful to the novel, Jackson et al have not simply been able to lift their screenplay directly from its pages without a few necessary changes. There is a great deal of mindfulness in the film about the portion of the audience (and it will be large) who are unfamiliar with the novels.Accordingly a great deal more emphasis has been placed upon pacing and storytelling more appropriate to a classic film narrative. Hence we need to see Gandalf's protracted bid to escape the clutches of Isenguard interspersed with the Hobbit's journey to Rivendell. It simply isn't appropriate to expect an audience to bear with the Hobbits' journey, no matter how good the actors are or how enthralling the story is, for upwards of an hour without constant reminders of the films other protagonists OR the threat of the evil they face. Having Gandalf just turn up at Rivendell and tell his story via CGI-filled flashbacks simply wouldn't have had the necessary effect. Secondly, the omission and reworking of characters. Yes, it was sad that Bakshi felt his animation didn't need Tom Bombadill, and given that he features strongly in Tolkien's other works this has to be frowned upon by the die-hard fanatics, but introducing diverting, but ultimately pointless episodes into the list of the challenges the Hobbits face is hardly going to keep you riveted to your seat is it? I mean, a man who stops the Hobbits being eaten, very slowly, by a tree with his power of song is just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age. The film is already stretching the audience's suspension of disbelief as far as it can go. Hence the chaff of Bombadill is cut. He isn't relevant to the rest of the story so he can be done without. It's sad for Tolkien fans for him not to be there but there's only so much celluloid available, even with a film this long. And yes, Arwen Undomiel never saved Frodo from the Dark Riders, but please, remember your girlfriend needs to have something to sink her teeth into as well, not just midgets and men with beards looking mean or scared as they fight monsters. So, for gender representation and a bid to prevent half the potential market (please remember that like all film, this is a product to be packaged and sold) her character gets a drastic overhaul. Go sister! There are numerous other issues relevant to the faithfulness of the adaptation from novel to screenplay but please, let's be content with what we've got here. It's a hard task to do all this well and Jackson, along with the rest of the boys and girls at Wingnut and WETA, should be commended for what they have achieved. That said there are some definite flaws in the film, even those that can't be overlooked by justifying the needs to relate to the popcorn and nachos audience. Firstly, we've got the Fellowship itself. Now, Merry and Pippin, while not really being established as Frodo's friends and thus not having the same kind of bond with him as they do in the novel are moderately well integrated. However, at the arrival of Boromir, Gimili and Legolas we just get left in the dark. None of these three characters, all representing important races, cultures and locations of the world of Middle Earth are given no more than token arrival-shots to introduce them, and little or no back-story as to how they came to be where they are or why they feel compelled to join Frodo's quest. Offering their various weapons is noble, and it sounds fantastic in the trailer, but when we finally get down to it we just don't know who they are or what they're about. Accordingly we don't ever really have time to care about any of these three, save for Legolas whose fighting proficiency alone makes him stand out. Sadly, Sean Bean is allowed little more than to switch from foreboding bad guy to friendly companion and back again (thus betraying his characters ultimate fate from the first time he opens his mouth) and John Rhys Davis is left with little more to do than scowl and look short. It doesn't help that both these characters seem to get a pretty raw deal for screen time, especially Gimli, who is barely in the film at all. We won't even begin to go into the seemingly superficial relationship we see between Sam and Frodo. All of this is indeed a shame. The film's greatest strength after its story are its strong characters. However, whereas in the book they have the space to develop and flesh themselves out here they have little more to do than look in awe at Gandalf, perhaps not with a humble air so much as a wonder that he's being allowed to soak up all the screen time. And yes, what you've heard is true; the fight sequences are shockingly bad. Well, perhaps that IS an overstatement. The fight sequences aren't exactly bad, they're riddled with good ideas and clever moves, but the camerawork and editing is so erratic that you'll have a hard time picking out anything to inspire awe or respect. The problem here is that the benchmarks for on screen fighting have all been established nowadays by The Matrix, Crouching Tiger and The Phantom Menace, and all of these films use lengthy shots to allow us to soak up the fight imaginative fight choreography, rather than have us crane our necks and dart about the screen with our eyeballs trying to glimpse it like a rare bird or nipple-flash at a premiere. Now, these, yet again, are only a few of the problems. There's the geography of Middle Earth, some ropey special effects moments and the clumsy ending to deal with. But you can read the books and see the film for yourself; I've already typed enough about all that here. BUT, now that I've just spent the main chunk of this review telling you about the shortcomings of The Fellowship of the Rings as both a movie and an adaptation let me tell you, it is good, exceptionally good. There is no denying that the storyline itself, acting, effects, props, sets and so on and so forth are all spot on. Visually the film is a triumph and WETA has now, without question placed itself ahead of Industrial Light and Magic in terms of industry leading special effects. There are bags of style to proceedings, with some sequences displaying the sheer amount of vision of the whole team to bring somewhat vague sections of the novel to life.All parts are played to perfection by the cast, and the casting is literally some of the best and most appropriate seen in years, none of this who-hot-and-who's-not Jerry Bruckheimer trash, it's a case of the best possible person for the part at every stage of the film. We'll give particular credit to Sir Ian Mckellan, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and Elijah Wood again here. No doubt they've had scores of favourable and loving reviews already but these performances truly are worth mentioning just once again. The film is a masterpiece from start to finish. Yes, it does take perseverance, no it's not entirely faithful to Tolkien's work and there are some serious flaws, but in a year that has been so barren of even five decent mainstream movies I think it's safe to say that no matter when this film had been released it would have outshone its competitors.","

"MattBirk","17 March 2016","Peter Jackson has created a modern day masterpiece that will surely stand the test of time and be labeled one of the great fantasy movies of all time. He has created a world that feels very real and in it, he puts some of the most authentic characters who makes the movie flourish. The use of practical effects is what makes the movie shine, the production design in the movie is perfect, everything looks authentic and magical, it's great to see him shy away from CGI when possible. The movie slowly reveals the diversity of Middle Earth and every new scene brings new wonders, it's astonishing to see the world unfold before our eyes.Fellowship is also the most personal and heartfelt of the three, seeing the Fellowship weaken and fall apart as the movie is devastating. Though the battles and storyline are the smallest and least 'epic' when compared to the second and third movies, the emotional impact here is the greatest. This is why the movie is the best of the three, the stakes are high for the group of people we care about, we just get to meet them and already they are falling apart. The character interactions between the original Fellowship is the best aspect of the movie, together there are no more than nine characters, but they are given the greatest task of Middle Earth. Not to mention to great comedy bits that take place between the hobbits and the other members of the group (the later movies move away from the comedic tones).The Lord of The Rings is easy one of the great trilogies of all time, they are all must-see movies!

"Tweekums","16 July 2009","This is a great film, unlike most films that are the first part of a trilogy you really do have to watch the remaining films to get the most out of the story as there is no sense of closure at the end of the film, it is merely the end of one part of their quest and the beginning of the next. This is not a bad thing; just make sure you'll have enough time to watch all three films fairly close together. The film is very long but I don't think there were any scenes that could have been removed or trimmed so the length is justified.I think the film followed the book fairly well, although I confess it has been a while since I read it. After a short prologue where we are given a history of The Ring. We then find ourself in the Shire, the home of the Hobbits; the wizard Gandalf has come to attend a birthday party for his old friend Bilbo Baggins. During the party Bilbo announces that he is going to be leaving the Shire, he then slips a ring onto his finger and vanishes into thin air. When he takes the ring off again he is confronted by Gandalf who tells him he must leave the ring behind when he goes as it is dangerous.Unfortunately his use of the ring has been noticed by the evil Sauron who has dispatched nine wraiths; horsemen who's sole purpose is to retrieve the ring for their master. Gandalf instructs Bilbo's nephew Frodo to take the ring to Elves at Rivendell. On the way he and three Hobbit friends meet up with a mysterious man who helps them flee from the riders although Frodo is wounded and needs the Elves to recover. At Rivendell the group learn that their quest is not over, they must continue on to Sauron's land of Mordor where they can finally destroy the ring. The group are joined by Gandalf, an Elf called Legolas, Gimli the Dwarf and a man called Boromir.This film doesn't go as far as Mordor, in fact it only shows the first part of the journey which will see our heroes battling Orcs, other strange creatures and their own desire for the power the ring may bring; not all of the group will survive.As this is a fantasy film they are a lot of special effects, thankfully they are so well done that they don't look like effects even though we know they must be, I especially liked how they made the hobbits look so small, had I not seen the actors in other films it would have been almost possible to believe that the actors really were that short. Peter Jackson did a great job on this film getting a good performance from all his actors; a combination of well known veteran actors and young actors who will probably go onto be stars although I suspect this is the film they will be remembered for.","

"pri_e","21 January 2002","From the first moment the movie starts you are immediately captivated by the story that evolves. The cinematography is just amazing, Peter Jackson did an incredible job conveying to us the times of the Hobbits. I believe the cast had excellent chemistry and it's refreshing to see a group of actors who seem to really break into their roles. I'm so happy that Elijah Wood played Frodo, he's a great actor and doesn't get as nearly enough recognition as he deserves. It's also a good breakthrough for Viggo Mortenson who has minor roles in ""28 Days"" and ""A Perfect Murder"", Liv Tyler is sweet as Arwen and I look forward to her character expanding in the next two installments. Ian McKellen is just a great actor to watch and really brought Gandalf to life, Sean Bean again is another actor who doesn't get nearly as enough credit as he deserves. Orlando Bloom is a cutie as Legolas, the hobbits are just funny to watch especially Sean Astin's Sam. Cate Blanchett was rather freaky as Galadriel, but I think the way her character signed off to Frodo is just the beginning of our understanding of her.All in all this is just an amazing movie!!","

There are a lot of very emotional moments like the fall of Gandalf and Boromir's death(this trilogy is one of the few movies that managed to make me cry a lot). There are also a lot of scary moments like the scene where a Nazgûl is searching our main characters.","

"Streetwolf","15 December 2002","When this hit the cinemas a bunch of my friends went to see it, but I didn't go and the reviews I got from them made me think it was either a bad movie or an average movie. So I finally decided to see it, I rented the extended dvd version and now I own it! Summary: I'll keep it short. In a distant time several rings were made and given to elves, dwarfs and mortal kings, but another powerful ring was made in the land of Mordor by the evil Sauron so he could rule Middle-Earth and control all other rings, but by accident his hand was cut off by Isildur, king of Gondor, who took ownership of the ring, not knowing that the ring had a mind of its own and it ended up betraying him. The ring, lost and forgotten was found first by... a thingie called Gollum, who the ring betrayed after keeping him alive for 500 years, and then it was found by Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, a small person. There it remained in his pocket for some 60 years, but Bilbo didn't age a day, until one day he wanted to leave. In that moment his old friend Gandalf came to see him. Gandalf realised that there was something about the ring, since Bilbo had made himself disappear in front of a crowd. Bilbo left the ring, but Gandalf could not touch it, so it ended up in the hands of Bilbo's cousin Frodo. Gandalf discovered that there would be people who would come after Frodo and take the ring, so he sent Frodo and his friend Samwise on a journey to make sure the ring did not fall into the wrong hands. But the ring has started to long for the hand of its master... On their journey their are aided by Strider, a mysterious ranger, who they don't know if they can trust. When two of Frodo's friends Merry and Pippin join in on the quest and with black horsemen riding after Frodo, they put their lives in Strider's hands hoping he can help them, unaware who Strider really is. When they reach Elrond he isn't able to help them, but comes with the solution of taking the ring to where it can be destroyed. Someone has to go to Mordor to destroy the ring, and when Frodo volunteers, in total 8 others join him and become the fellowship of the ring.
At first I thought the movie was far too long and it had too many things that we really didn't need to know, but after seeing it so many times, I keep questioning why they couldn't make it just a little more longer? My favourite character is Strider/Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen, he is perfectly casted for the charming mysterious stranger no one can seem to quite place in the whole movie until the middle. In fact I like the entire cast, they were brilliant!!My rating for this movie is 10/10 and I don't believe another movie can top this one.","

"darimoviesthoughtsoffilms","25 December 2019","I will keep it short, because almost everyone has seen this film. This is a spoiler-free review aswell.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an awesome movie. It is kind of like a combination of multiple genres: It is most fantasy but there is also action, romance and a good bit of horror (Moria) plus some jokes as topping. The casting aswell as the performances are great, the special effects holds up suprisingly well and the ending is magnificent. Score is also fantastic.I'm not fanboying when I say that it is a 10/10, because this movie is almost as near perfect one can be, and the sequels does not dissapoint (at least the two following). If you haven't watched it yet, I strongly suggest that you go buy the whole trilogy!","

"Norman_French","6 January 2024","Movies are stories about character. Here we have a classic fantasy story with memorable characters, and arguably one of the best movies of all time. Let's look at categories for flaws.Casting/Acting/Directing: Excellent. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving amaze.Soundtrack: Excellent, whether dramatic, spooky, or evocative. There are two songs by Enya. The end credits are worth watching just for the music.Visuals: Excellent. One can get lost in wonderment at times.Story and book adaptation: Excellent. The film is completely immersive, despite being a tad overly-sentimental at times.Editing, pacing, and run-time: It's possible to detect minor continuity errors that couldn't be covered up by editing, but they are easily dismissed. The pacing is great, and the long run length is totally appropriate.In short, this is EASILY a 10-star movie. Also, a special shout-out to Cate Blanchett; her Galadriel is alluring, creepy, daunting, and ethereal -- PERFECT for a supernatural character of this stature. Her prologue narration was also excellent.","

"knightox","29 October 2019","While I love all three three of the ""Lord of the Rings"" the ""Fellowship"" just seems to stand out among the other two. It appears to me more polished and well crafted. This is where we get to meet all of our primary heroes and villains. One aspect I truly enjoyed was the story Boromir. Some consider him a villain but I consider Boromir more of a ""tragic hero"" character who redeems himself in the end with his last stand and farewell. Also the standoff between Gandalf and the Balrog is the stuff of movie legends. ""You shall not pass!"". Getting to see all the different places and kingdoms of Middle Earth on the big screen made me feel like a little kid again when I first saw it in a theater. I doubt any motion picture will ever be able to capture my imagination like ""Fellowship of the Ring"".","

"DeborahPainter855","18 August 2011","I tried to like this movie, I really tried, but the early scenes with the hobbits were dull and clichéd. Nothing interested me. The fireworks scene was trite. I have seen thousands of films, and so I feel I have the ability to evaluate a film based not on who directed it but how well it is paced, the quality of the film score and how the characters engage the viewer. This one was lacking in almost all departments save the special effects. The big battle between the two wizards during the first hour did nothing for me or my sister, who sat down to watch the DVD with me. We both got bored and turned the movie off after an hour. She read all the Lord of the Rings novels in college and told me that the film departed too much from the novels. I read The Hobbit when I was in high school and liked it. But I won't be bothering with any other Lord of the Rings films from Peter Jackson.","

"bullions27","7 October 2002","The first installment had its moments and yes, I was wowed and thrilled by seeing one of my favorite novels come to the big screen. However, FotR didn't exactly leave a lasting impression on me unlike, for example, Platoon, where I would always remember the message it brought to me... sort of like a novel. FotR, to me, was more like a spectacular fireworks show.The plot behind the story is simple and Jackson and his group did a very good job transmuting what was in the novel to a screenplay. I don't know why some people complained about the ""complexity"", or didn't understand the purpose of the characters or the plot. How much clearer can Jackson make it without smacking you all in the face and telling you to wake up? It's about a ring, a very powerful ring, crafted by a evil menace. That evil menace lost his ring, and now he's back to reclaim it, but it's now in the hands of an innocent Hobbit. That Hobbit goes to Place A for advice, meets a myriad of characters all of whom describe how evil and powerful the ring is, and now he must go destroy it. Jesus Christ, this isn't quantum physics here.In any case, the movie does a more than adequate job portraying Tolkien's world in oh, 3 hours. It's a monumental task and I'm sure Jackson has spent many a sleepless nights pondering what he could use and what he had to throw out from the 600 pages of the original novel. The sets were done flawlessly (Khazad-Dum ranks as one of my favorite scenes) with the amount of CGI and excellent directing and lighting, and it provided a real and genuine fantasy feeling unlike the schlockfest from Attack of the Clones. My only gripe would be the characters themselves. All of them, decent acting, but the decision how they were going to be relevant to the story... well... that's my gripe. Examples, Jackson's poor handling of Boromir's death scene, the lack of the Broken Sword story with Aragorn, and Gimli's 180 of character from the novel. Regardless, it didn't detract me from thoroughly enjoying most of the movie.I am eagerly anticipating for the Two Towers based on the second novel, IMO, the best of the trilogy, this winter.9/10","

"cricketbat","4 February 2020","The Fellowship of the Ring is an impressive film because it introduces Middle Earth in a way that appeases both newcomers and die-hard fans. There is a lot of story to cram into the beginning of this trilogy, and this movie does it in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming. From the casting to the sets to the visual effects, The Fellowship of the Ring starts this epic Lord of the Rings adventure off on the right foot.","

"mhalvorson","14 February 2002","What a film!No doubt about it.  If you've read the books you are at an advantage (unless you consider them some sort of holy relic and can't get past that to actually enjoy the film for itself).  I think knowing the characters and story pretty intimately allows you to effectively ""fill in the blanks"" where the films let you down in terms of taking the time to flesh out characters and relationships or where it jumps from one set piece to the next.Having said that I went with someone sho has never read a fantasy book let alone LOTR and she loved it.  Go figure.I thought it was as good as anything I've seen in a long time, but it is virtually impossible for those who loved the books to review the film as a stand alone piece.****MINOR SPOILERS****Viggo M was perfect.  Ian M was pretty damn good too but Sean Bean was my pick.  It's a good story that can make you cry over a character that failed the test and betrayed the fellowship.I think it mostly hit the mark in terms of what to edit from Tolkien's work. Let's face it, Bombadil was a side trip.  Glorifindel was irrelevant. Thank God they cut the songs.The only aspect that annoyed me was the over-the-top portrayal of Galadriel, leaving her a much less sympathetic character.  She is not the wicked witch of the west! But it's a minor point.  As a whole I sat transfixed for three hours and then snuck back again a few days later.  After a month I'm still getting shivers thinking of it (YOU SHALL NOT PASS - great in the book, just as good on film).The cinematography, special effects, etc was all superb.  The fight scenes were very jumpy so the detail were hard to capture ... but that sounds to me like what it must be like in a battle.I suppose a comment re greatest of all time is in order since it has polarised opinion so much ... Who cares?  Noone will ever convince anyone else to have the same opinion as themselves so give it up.  How can you compare a fantasy three film epic to a prison drama (Shawshank Redemption) or a mafia film (Godfather) or anything else?9 for me and can't wait for The Two Towers.","

"TheOtherFool","20 July 2004","First off, I'd like to make a statement: I have not read any of the LOTR books by Tolkien. I once started out in The Hobbit, but didn't think much of it. So I'd like to review the Movie, and will not relate it to the book. So I don't care if Middle Earth 'came to life' to some viewers, or if the Orks really had 3 eyes or whatever. I don't care about that.Let's start with a view at the story. A ring that has the power to destroy the world falls into the hands of young Frodo (Wood), who with help of several friends has to destroy it on a special place. The first movie of the trilogy basically are these people on their journey to that place.And that's it. I don't care where that place is, which member of the Fellowship really is the son of whom, what is going to happen in the next movies or whatever. This is the open ended story presented, and it's really not that interesting. Way too many (unimportant) characters are involved, the movie is lacking in story and pace and isn't as epic as a lot of people (mostly fans of the book), make you believe it is.If you analyze it, the movie goes like this: Group of people taking a journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey, etcetera, etcetera. These fights might be against different enemies (Orks, Uru-kai, a huge monster or black knights), it all comes down to the same thing. And that, to be honest, is a bit boring.The worst part though is that when Lotr:Fotr finally does finish, nothing has really happened. They're still on their journey, still losing guys and I'm sure they're gonna have a lot more fights in the other 2 films, of which I already saw The Two Towers. Is it really necessary to expand an easy (mind you, I didn't say bad) story to a 9 hour movie extravaganza? For instance, is Cate Blanchetts character really of importance to the movie? No, the only reason she's in there because she's in the book. And that's a pretty lame reason, since this is Film-making we're talking about.Now, it's not that the Fellowship is a really bad movie. It all looks phenomenal and we have to congratulate Peter Jackson for the fact he got those studio people mad (or, in retrospect, wise) enough to spend so much money on it. We have to respect Tolkien for creating an exciting world, full of imaginative details.But, for the many things Fellowship is (a cool look at the book for fans?), a good movie it most definitely is not. 6/10.","

"arthur_tafero","23 January 2023","I found the book more interesting than the film. The essence of the book, in my opinion, is not the fierce warriors or the battle scenes, but the buildup of the characters of the most helpless of all the participants in this drama, the Hobbit. Although having great music and cinematography, the film lacks soul. It is visually stunning, and the actors do a great job with the roles they are given, but the real problem is that many adults will just not believe the content. That is why the Hobbit is so important to both the novel and the film; it provides soul to an otherwise souless existence.Part of the problem may have been that the producers decided to take the easy way out and create a film for the senses rather than the mind or the soul. And this works well, once again, with younger audiences. Adults want more than just bells and whistles.","

So I dont like it and it's not fair"" can just take their opinion and stick it where the light of elendil don't shine. This series of movies is perfect. They look amazing. They are captivating. Moving. Exciting. The soundtrack is unbelievably good. The 1st of the three is the perfect start to a 12 hour plus marathon which is nothing short of mesmerising. The actors know their job and stick to it. Nowhere do we see one of the actors try and be more than their part. Everyone of them combine to create the world of middle earth and its inhabitants perfectly. Watched again in Jan 2024 and I honestly don't think it could be remade with modern technology any better than Jackson manages to pull off. Just an all round superb piece of movie making. A rare but well deserved 10 out of 10.","

"cruise01","1 April 2020","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (5 out of 5 stars).The film is amazing and a great start of a trilogy. When i first saw it not knowing it was a trilogy. I thought the film dragged on and was cheesy with the acting. And the movie ending being incomplete. After realizing it was a trilogy of books and movies. It is a great start for a first movie. I love the cast ensemble and they all did great. Peter Jacksons direction defies a whole new fantasy genre and epic storytelling with his writers. The plot is great. I never thought the movie was slow for a three hour film. The visual effects are great. The film does have some exciting battle sequences with the characters facing against trolls. Orcs. And a demonic looking beasts.The music score. Cinematography. The script. The cast. And direction is all amazing for a wonderful start for the first movie out of the trilogy.","

However, after I started getting into A Song of Ice and Fire, I decided to watch the movies since the franchise played as inspirations to the series. So I started binge watching the trilogy with my sister, who was a fan of the series before I was.Needless to say, I'm definitely going to read the books when I'm done with the trilogy because after watching this film, i definitely want to become a big fan. This has one of the most compelling beginnings to a whole major story. They way they introduce the characters and how we gain empathy towards them is so flawless that sometimes I forget about the length and enjoy it for the spectacle it is.","

It spawned role playing games and inspired countless imitations - it literally embraced and celebrated the Celtic and Norse cultures that inspired it. Tolkien's aim was to create a mythology for Britain, and he succeeded - LOTR is truly a cultural phenomenon.The Lord of the Rings film by Peter Jackson transformed fantasy on film. Before Jackson, fantasy films were usually low budget affairs, a niche. This film paved the way for Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and the rest.Do yourself a favor: Read Lord of the Rings, then watch Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings - an adaption of the books that is faithful and revered by all true ""Hobbit Heads.""","

I was glued to my seat for the full 3 hours and I didn't want the film to end. The 3 hours felt like 15 minutes. I say to the doubters go and see this film.

"rooprect","21 August 2005","In all fairness, it's a good kids movie. But I'm afraid that all the hype & numerous awards will fool some people into believing it has artistic merit. Once again, let me stress: IT'S A KIDS MOVIE.You'll find no subtlety, no symbolism, no real character development, no underlying theme, no clever dialog, and nothing really to challenge your mind. Instead you'll get action, dazzling landscapes, special effects, a rushing musical score, good costumes, good makeup and action (I say that twice, because it's the best thing the movie has going for it... really, the action scenes are pretty good).But if you're looking for an *artistic* fairy tale (like City of Lost Children, Brazil, Big Fish, The Crow, Nosferatu [1979] or Arizona Dream), you'll not only be disappointed... you'll be downright annoyed.","

"ADOZER200","6 February 2002","This move definitely is a classic of today. The directing was pure excellence and the special effects are outstanding. I havent seen a movie made this well since the late eighties sometime. I was always thinking that it was about time for them to come out with a fantasy movie. Im not a big fan of the lord of the rings but after seeing this i have to get into it more. The characters were awesome. Whenever every single one of the characters do good then youve got a classic and thats in any movie. They couldnt have chosen a better actor than Elijah Wood to play Frodo. He has the sadness in his eyes and the humble like features that i felt Frodo should have. Ian McKellan did great as Magneto in XMEN but he excelled that part as Gandolf. His true colors came out at the end as showed his true courage against the shadowy fire beast. Sean Astin of course did a good job as always. John Rhyeis Davies did wonderful as the Dwarf. I didnt even recognize him at first. Strider was a very well liked character, id like to see more of him in the sequels and Orlando Bloom played an unforgettable role as an elf. It proves to all of us the cool and determination(and great skill)elves have in battle. Even when the goblins attacked at close range you could see the concentration in his eyes to destroy the creatures. I just have to say this movie was a 10 all the way because of everyones effort they put into it. This is definitely the new trilogy of the century for all of us to enjoy!!!!!!!!!","

"zapdude","13 November 2002","I still snicker at some of the wordy trashing comments being posted here. I especially like the arrogant little know-it-all who called this film arrogant.Ever since the 1950's when the Lord of the Rings books were released, virtually every fantasy ever made can trace some aspect of its origins to these stories. Even Star Wars is based on this story, and much of the Led Zeppelin imagery came from here. Directly.To tell most stories, all you need is to pack a little two hour package together. This story is bigger than that, it is sweeping, majestic, and powerful. It is the granddaddy of fantasy stories, so to speak.The point that many people miss is that there is supposed to be ugliness, the ugly parts are to contrast the bright parts. The placid Shire goes up against the horrors of the grown-in-the-dirt Orcs, who are not exceptionally powerful as individuals, but overwhelming in numbers.This first movie is laying the groundwork for the epic struggles to follow. We are merely meeting the characters and setting the stage. If you don't have the patience to accept that this background is neccessary to tell the rest of the story, then I truly pity you.The Extended Edition DVD is marvelous. I am still struck by the incredible attention to detail and overall ""feel"" of this work from Peter Jackson, and I don't think I'm being disrespectful when I say that his previous work does not foreshadow this achievement at all. 208 minutes of this movie is barely enough. The texture is stunning, in spite of the overly lingering Liv Tyler sequences and a few other minor niggles.Maybe you don't have the time to comprehend why this movie is awesome. Perhaps you can't see the value of the intense personal sacrifices being made in every scene of this movie. Too bad for you.The Lord of the Rings was written with the memory of World War II fresh in Tolkien's mind. Wars, battles, and struggle are the nature of the tale. In spite of it all, there are pockets of sunshine and peace, and these pockets are our story. Good will conquer the evil!","

"Quinoa1984","20 December 2001","Co-writer and producer/director Peter Jackson has masterfully transferred J.R.R. Tolkien's first chronical in his infamous trilogy into an absorbing, interesting and above all awesome picture.  It is quite long, which is the film's only downside, but then in order to tell Tolkien's tale properly as many details would be necessary, thus it is never boring. 
This first epic starts off Frodo Biggins (Elijah Wood) on his dangerous yet crucial quest along with others like Gandolf (Ian McKellan) and Strider (Viggo Mortensen) to bring the rings back to which the fire it came from. The plot is important, but that isn't the key thing about the film that will intrigue most non-fans on Tolkien (fans of Tolkien make this a must see by the way).  The picture has so much visual splendor matched with constant (yet not too constant) suspense, action and battles that it is hard to complain about the few lulls.  Not the best epic fantasy I've, but it could be up there.  Big props go to McKellan by the way for giving one of his best performances to date with Gandolf, though the other performances are also noteworthy. A","

I actually ended up walking in freezing temperatures to catch this flick when it was released on the big screen. I left the theater in awe of what I had witnessed, I was inspired! This was a fantastic beginning to the trilogy. The characters were given enough screen time to understand and support them through the rest of the trilogy. The visuals and effects were really nice, and the score was just perfect. The Mines of Moria was perhaps the best part of the film. Its environment was well captured, as it effectively created an eerie feeling.The movie passed like a breeze, despite its long running time, which was essential to capture the aura of the movie.

"rastaban3","24 January 2002","This one was a real treat to see.  It is not often that I have been truly entertained by a good story. Lord of the Rings is on of those few films that does this.  The plot line of this film is was kept me glued to it.  It did not have any weak points that I could tell.  It moved along well and only had a few points where the plot dragged a little.  I also have to admit, at times the film did seem to be taking a very long time but it also seemed to move quick.  I also feel that the film stopped at a good spot and it seemed to be a natural break in the story.  I wonder what more could be coming in the next films.  The acting was strong.  I was surprised by how well Elijah Wood preformed in his massive role.  I was very grateful the director did not allow his character or dwell on indecision which tends to bog down other films.  The supporting actors and actresses was also very good and really helped the film move along.  These two things combined really make for a good entertaining experience.  I have not read the books and I am not very familiar with this type of movie so I did not really know what to expect.  I have to admit, this was good and well worth my time.  The only draw back would be some of the fight scenes.  They may be a little too violent for children.  Over all, the best film of 2002 I have seen so far, (10 out of 10)","

"Rob_Taylor","30 December 2002","Most of what needs to be said about LOTR has already been said. It's a fine movie that pleased and delighted even the many nay-sayers who thought that Peter Jackson would produce  another movie like Braindead. Having now watched the extended version I have to say that it adds a few extra scenes without going too far and just rounds out the story a little more. There are still a couple of scenes I would have liked to have seen in the film, namely the Barrow-Wights and also the scene after they leave Moria where they look into the lake, but very little of any consequence is left out of the story.The cast are all excellent and very much as I imagined them when reading the books many years ago. It's also refreshing to see a movie where the film isn't carried by one or two main actors. All the cast get significant screen time, and the various sub-stories (Gimli and Moria or Boromir, for example) are well presented and not skimpy add-ons to the main plot.There are some liberties with the script and characterization. For example, Merry and Pippin are now much more along for comic-relief than the serious young hobbits they were in the book. But even this works, as it provides a source of light humour to an otherwise quite dark storyline.And to those that say it's nothing like the books, well..... just be thankful it didn't turn into Dungeons and Dragons, or you'd really have something to cry about.","

"denis888","7 September 2007","It is very, very difficult to write about The Lord Of The Rings. So much has been already said, written, discussed and argued about this epic of a film that every new comment tends to repeat any already written work. I will try, anyway. I like this film, all three parts. I remember the trembling in my body before going and seeing the first part, The Fellowship Of The Ring. And, yet, I liked that. I watched the film in cinema twice and then countless times on DVD, an enlarged version on two discs, with many deleted or shortened versions. The ensemble of the actors is just amazing. Now, after the film, it will be impossible to imagine any other Frodo but Elijah Wood, any Gandalf but Sir Ian McKellan, and any Galadriel but Kate Blanchette. And then, there is Sean Bean as an impeccably neat and marvelously great Boromir. And then, there are Orlando Bloom and John Rhys Davies as Legolas and Gimli respectively. The first film is an excellent change from a peaceful, sweet Shire to a gloomy Moria, then from fabulous Rivendell to terrible Mordor. The Orcs, the Elves, the Hobbits are all here, they are larger than any life, they live, eat, drink, sleep, talk, breathe. And what is simply amazing you never doubt that they are. Peter Jackson and his team did an enormous job. Thanks to them, we see and feel the smoke of the wars, the tragedy of poor Boromir, the suffers of Frodo or Arwen. And what makes the film so brilliant, is the feeling at the very final scene that you want to see the next right now, you simply cannot wait",NA

To wit: the magnificent, subterranean Goblin Hall (a CGI architecture masterpiece, 200-foot pillars stretching into shrouded distance); the hybrid orc at the tomb of Balin (a giant lumpy thing with the speed of a train and the relentlessness of Herpes Simplex B); the crumbling stone stairs, (a gratuitous flexing of effects muscle, which leaves one to assume that it was created merely to annoy George Lucas); Bilbo's initial meeting with Gandalf (a masterful handling of double-camera technique so subtle that it took a few moments to even realize your eyesight was being exploited); and so it went, each effect only enhancing the credibility of this incredible tale, paradoxically making this Fantasy World seem more 'real', rather than a CGI glut-fest: camera panning through vast caverns aflame with activity, as if they really existed; giant sculptures from antiquity adorning the countryside; wizardry, beasts, Vallejo-esque structures.The movie being named The Lord Of The Rings, it was imperative to keep reminding the suburbanite viewer what all the running and screaming and poking was over. Consequently, there were 3 million close-ups of a filth-encrusted hand opening around a gold ring. Like Rocky Horror fans emulating their film heroes, people arrive at screenings having not washed their hands or hair for weeks. If you can make a person puke by letting them smell your hand, you get in for free.ELIJAH WOOD, not having reached puberty yet at 22, played wide-eyed, bushy-footed hobbit hero, Frodo, cerulean-blue peepers and cheeks as-yet-unscarred by the Gillette Corporation. Urged by Gandalf to journey afar to destroy the Ring Of Power, Frodo embarks with three idiot friends. At an inn of disrepute, Frodo inadvertently rings his finger with this talisman and is assaulted by high-decibel shockwave static, out-of-focus fuzzheadedness and time-dilatory slow motion, a sum effect not unlike having way too much tequila with the boys the night before and going home with a fat stripper named Belulah and waking up with your face buried firmly between elephantine cheeks. (How I miss those days.)  Here, the Hobbits ally with -VIGGO MORTENSEN, as Strider/ Aragorn/ Euro Guy Compleat, the unshaven rockstar Hero. Always looking like he's just stepped out of a shower that didn't clean him, wet-haired Viggo lends his mighty sword to the quest in the hope that Wizard Gandalf might one day conjure up some soap. As the Hero Who Gets The Girl, on his first day of shooting, Viggo started making out with -ORLANDO BLOOM, until someone told him that wasn't the girl. Bloom, whose name is perfectly congruent with the prim, blond elfin archer he played, Legolas, was responsible for holding up shooting for days on end when camera lenses would crack under the spell of his haunting boy-face. Constantly knocking on his trailer door, begging for beauty tips, was -LIV TYLER. A goddess. The sensual electricity is headily apparent between her and Viggo, even though he hasn't washed since 1437 and his musky shirt is now stuck to his back with sweat. Some chicks just dig the rugged outdoorsy type, I guess.  Anyone got her number? Certainly not -SEAN ASTIN, who, having reached puberty and finding that he didn't like it, reverted back to dull, ambiguous child actor. Playing Frodo's sidekick, Sam-I-Am, most notably from Dr. Seuss's classic tale of Wizardry and Demonology, Green Eggs And Ham, Sam-I-Am is entrusted by Gandalf to ward Frodo. His one attempt at poignancy (`If I take one more step, it's the farthest I've ever been from home') is slamdunked by two hobbits from the East End, who join the quest to travel to the farthest reaches of the land, which was about ten miles down the road. Led by -IAN MCKELLEN, renowned rille-faced veteran of stage, film and backdoor-mannery, as the stringy-haired, hessian-robed wizard Gandalf The Grey, hard-pressed curbing his desire to touch Elijah Wood's Golden Ring, dusky whispers taunting him whenever the candy-skinned man-boy would saunter near. One face-crease away from being Patrick Stewart's doppelganger, McKellen leads a ragtag expedition (did I just say 'ragtag'?) into special effects flummery, from the Elfin City, run by -HUGO WEAVING, whose thespian prowess successfully melded two of his most famous roles: that of Agent Smith in The Matrix and the drag queen in Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert. Told by Peter Jackson, to `wear something from Priscilla', he did, perfectly befitting his role as the Elfin Queen. But can there be anyone more fey than the ORIGINAL Lord Of The Wings -CHRISTOPHER LEE, aka Dracula (pronounced 'Drah-kyule', which lends it more legitimacy for some reason), playing the treacherous Saruman, Gandalf's Human Resources Manager. Enrobed in startling white, snowy mane cascading to his lower back, beard grown down to big-ass medallion (that was how he turned up on set every day - before makeup), Wahmpyre Christopher is testament to the rejuvenative diet of worms and virgin blood. Considering his mortal body died 35 years ago, Lee continues to make onscreen cameos with as much verve as undead people half his age, like -THE BALROG, undoubtedly the COOLEST daemon to stalk cloven-hoofed and flame-chiaroscuroed across a screen, stage or pentacle EVER! This torn-winged, hell-blackened, ram-horned apotheosis of Evil Incarnate (how I love him so!), faces off with The Great Gandalf in a cinematic sequence so astounding, breath-stopping and power-hammering that George Lucas is *still* trying to re-write Star Wars Episode Three.There are two more Rings movies on the way, each, so we hear, as monumentally staggering as this one - Good Luck, George!",NA
"baumer","13 January 2004","Well, it has been three years since the Lord of the Rings graced our screens.  And in those three years, our film landscape has literally been dominated by the series.  There have been other films of importance, but nothing that can truly compare with the scope and the sheer grandiose manner in which LOTR has inundated us with.  Simply put, there has not been more of a domination of films since Star Wars and its original sequels hogged grosses and headlines from 1977-1983.  I am an avid and eager contributor to imdb and I love to write reviews but have purposely not said anything about the three LOTR films because I wanted to wait until I had seen all three of them before commenting on them.  Now that I have seen all three, let me begin with FOTR.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a thing of beauty. This is a film that is nearly perfect in every way.  Beginning with the characters, this film takes us on a labyrinthine journey through middle earth and part of the fun is meeting everyone that is going to play a part in the story down the road.  I think the EE on DVD is an even better film than the theatrical version and if you have a chance to see it, even though it is 4 hours long, do yourself a favour and do so.  There is much more explained than what you see in the theatrical version.FOTR introduces us to the hobbits, to Gandalf the wizard and his adversary Sauruman and ultimately to the great eye, Sauron.  Also along the journey to Mordor are Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn and the three other hobbits, Samwies, Merry and Pippin.The one element of FOTR that struck me is that it is a film about discovery. The journey begins here and it is that much more fun to see the genesis of the story and the genesis of the characters.  In each of the three films, each character grows a bit at a time.  In FOTR, we get to see the start of this journey.  Frodo is just a scared hobbit thrust into a great deed here. In ROTK he grows into an honourable and stoic character, but in here, he is scared and feels alone, even with his fellowship of nine.Perhaps one of the main reasons that makes this film so much better than the last two, in my opinion, is that it perfectly blends action and character into a beautiful narrative and it makes you feel for the characters you are watching.  Gandalf's fate in this film is a heartwrenching scene and Boromir's is even tougher to get through.  I shed a few tears at the end of this film.FOTR should have won a plethora of Oscars in 2001 and it is a shame that it lost to A Beautiful Mind.  I think that in 10 years, no one will remember this as Ron Howard's film that took the Oscar.  But FOTR will be remembered as one of the best films of the last 20 years.  There is a bit of everything in the film and for those that crave excellence in film, they need look no further than Fellowship of the Ring.  I have it at number 9 on my all time list and that is saying something.  This is truly a remarkable film.  I have always thought that the books were just okay stories but to see what Jackson and his team of writers has managed to do, is truly remarkable.  In the book, the best part of the story was the meeting of the Fellowship.  This was at the council of Elrond and it is also one of the best scenes in the film.  This is where we get to meet Boromir and Legolas and Gimli.  In the book, I remember the council scene being close to 100 pages in length. Much of it was just talk and in the film, Jackson has managed to keep much of the intrigue with scenes like this, but condensing them to fit into a 3 hour film.  This is just one of the nuances of the film that make it such a fine piece of film making.While I still believe that Star Wars is the best fantasy series ever filmed, at least Lord of the Rings is a voice for today's generation and they have a film that they can relate to and call their own so that in 30 years from now the next great fantasy epic is unleashed, the debate can rage all over again, which is the best of all time?FOTR is one of the best films of all time.10/10",NA
"matthewcohen-82259","17 July 2021","There are movies I love as much as Fellowship, but there are very few things I love more than it. The whole trilogy is great, but almost nothing out there is as breathtaking as the first of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Returning to it as an adult, it really is shocking how incredible this is from start to finish. Despite its length I maintain, to this day, that it is never boring and constantly arresting. Achingly beautiful, occasionally funny, the definition of epic, Fellowship of the Ring has it all. Oh, and that soundtrack? Need I say more? 10/10, a timeless masterpiece.",NA
"KaiaJadeR","10 June 2022","""The Lord of the Rings"", is an exceptionally complicated story. There are countless species, places and languages presented throughout this movie- yet, miraculously I found it easy to follow and super entertaining.This film is a prime example of fantasy done right. It not only captures a highly loved story but contains every element that makes a fantasy movie so fascinating. There's beautifully crafted sets, a unique and recognizable soundtrack and realistic proportions and costumes for each character.My favourite aspect of film is production design, so I might be biased...but I think the sets are what make this movie so magical. The fantasy prevalent in the sets is what allows ""The Lord of the Rings"" to be so easy to follow and enjoy. Although the movie includes so many details and information, I could rely on the sets, the colour and the style to provide insight on what was happening and where the characters were.Another artistic element that helped develop the story was the soundtrack. The music was well suited to each scene, and helped capture the emotions the characters experienced. The music included a lot of unique instruments, and had a great otherworldly sound.An aspect of this film I found very impressive was the costume and character design. I loved how different each character appeared physically. Their outfits not only gave me an idea of their background, but also their role in the story.Overall I found ""The Lord of the Rings"" very entertaining. It's an amazing example of what every fantasy film should accomplish.",NA
"Aggi-3","7 December 2001","Well, what can I say? I had high expectations and was worried that I would be disappointed, this is Lord of the rings after all. Peter Jackson pulled it off big time, surpassed my expectations. He takes my favorite book and brings it to live on the screen and sucks me so right into it that I was feeling shellshocked afterwards. It was definately the best movie of the year and it's wonderfull beyond belief. When I walked out I just wanted to go back in and see it again. There are no words who can describe what I felt when I watched it and the only complaints I got about it, it ends and I'll have to wait for one year to see the next one. Peter Jackson, I salute you!",NA
"jace_the_film_guy","24 September 2022","The Fellowship of the Ring is possibly the best introduction to a fictional world in all of cinema. The setting is gorgeous, the score is iconic and the director knows exactly what he wants to accomplish.There are slower moments to the casual viewer, but every piece of dialogue is necessary to the final plot. The story is not afraid to dive deep into Tokien's lore, while also being vulnerable with its characters. From Frodo to Sam to Aragorn and beyond, each character is relatable and worth rooting for.This movie is a brilliant escape and is storytelling at its finest. The stakes are set, the characters are moving and with two movies on the horizon, The Lord of the Rings saga has just begun with this near-perfect film.Best Character: Aragorn
Best Moment: The Council of Elrond
Best Quote: ""All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us."" - Gandalf.",NA
"itamarscomix","8 December 2011","As one of thousands (if not millions) of people who harbored a Tolkien obsession in their youths, I anticipated the Lord of the Rings films with both excitement and dread. It's hard to remember now, but back in the year 2000 most of the world thought Tolkien's magnum opus was unfilmable. It took a hobbit-like, New Zealand native horror comedy director to prove them all wrong. Some fans were quick to point out the flaws, the deviations made from the source material, but for anyone who actually loved the spirit and the atmosphere of the novels, Peter Jackson's films were more than anyone could hope for.A decade later, with the initial excitement, hype and backlash died down, it's easier to see these films for what they are, both the good and the bad. And while they're definitely flawed, and they definitely deviate from the novels quite often (a necessity), they're also - and I say this without second thoughts - the best mainstream films of the previous decade. When considered as a standalone creation and not an adaptation, they're excellent works of cinema, perfectly balancing a fast, energetic pace, impressive special effects that have aged shockingly well, exciting action scenes, great dramatic acting, immense amounts of pathos and drama and just the right amount of comic relief. Jackson also managed the singular achievement of using the trilogy format to the films' benefit; not since the original Star Wars trilogy has there been a trilogy of films in which not one disappoints, each one expending over the previous installments (in stark contrast with the Matrix - which was released around the same time, and in which, it grew gradually clearer, the creators had no idea what to do with the sequels).The problems the films had are mostly derived from the difficulty of filming at such a large scope. Deviations from the original are mostly excused; ""No Tom Bombadil"" seems as ridiculous a complaint, in hindsight, as ""Organic web shooters"". The writers did a spectacular job of removing just enough and changing just enough to make Lord of the Rings work (spectacuarly well) as a work of cinema. My biggest complaint is about lack of characterization and background for some of the supporting character, mostly Boromir, Gimli and Legolas. Boromir was reduced to little more than a villain, though Sean Bean was good enough to give him the kind of depth and humanity the character should have; Gimli and Legolas were practically comic relief. The acting was so good all around, though, that it's hard to notice. In fact, no fantasy casting website could have put together a better cast, and nobody stands out as a ""weak link"".Lord of the Rings is probably the only case in history of a series of films where all entries do nothing but compliment each other - no complete shift in genre (Aliens), no gradual declination (Matrix), no anticlimactic third installment (The Godfather, Back to the Future). For that reason it's hard for me to compare the three, though Fellowship of the Ring has a special place in my heart, because it was the real shocker - it was the crucial point in time when we found out Tolkien could be filmed after all. Every film in the series has its weaknesses and strengths - The Two Towers has timeless scenes with Gollum but some much slower ones focusing on Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas; Return of the King has lots of pathos, but relies too heavily on huge battle scenes and has one of the most disappointing endings in film history. But taken all together, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the most solid, most entertaining, most wonderfully impressive and memorable, most epic films ever made, and that will never change.",NA
"RussHog","6 December 2018","Big fan of the book - I felt this movie started a little slow but found its pace and turned into a spectacular telling of The Godfather of fantasy books. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is fantastic. The costumes and sets and props are all spectacular. Builds a real container that the dark lord Sauron sought his ring of power and the complex web of heroes and villains who took action to help or hinder his pursuit. It's solid fantasy that pays tribute to the source material. Magnificent.",NA
"Jennie Parker","25 June 2002","WARNING: SPOILERSI loved this adopation of the movie. I thought that the casting was good, (so many hot guys, so little time to see them!) and Elijah Wood was perfect as Frodo. Sean Astin was amazing as Sam Gamgee, the loyal and clumsy servant of Frodo. Dominc Monohag and Billy Boyd pulled off Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took wonderfully. Even though they changed Arwen's part a little bit, and they cut out one of my favorite charecters, the movie mostly followed the book. My favorite part was when Gandalf fell into the abyss in Moria (""Fly, you fools!"") and I eagerly await The Two Towers, coming in December of 2002",NA
