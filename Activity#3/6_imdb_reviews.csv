"Gordon-11","19 October 2009","This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.","

"ebiros2","17 October 2005","The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people.""","

"Sleepin_Dragon","26 January 2023","Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews, by employing them in his factories, this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.This was, and will forever be, one of the best films ever made, not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust, but truly as masterpiece, one of the best.If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears, you're made of stronger stuff than I am, the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10.","

"Fella_shibby","9 September 2013","Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.

"EVON1TY","2 March 2023","As you may know there is lots of World War II movies. Some of them shows you the worst parts of war, this one is doing something better.Shows you the war is bad for everyone. Shows you een the little kindness is the greatest thing. Shows you ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely.""I saw so many World War II movies, non of them gave me these feelings. Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters. And I don't know how but some of them says war is a good thing if you're shooting bad people.Besides one of the greatest historical Screenplay, the Acting Performances just superb. I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.Scores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.Cinematography is too great, watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that. I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming, but most of them are not being successful at.Art Direction and Set Decoration is also too varied. They managed to do an enormous job. You feel the greatness in the movie with varied places and objects.","

"mark.waltz","29 August 2014","History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy.","

"SnoopyStyle","23 March 2014","Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end.","

This is an emotional movie that emphasizes one of the worst periods in the history of mankind. I'm a big list person so anytime there's a list of the 10, 20, 50 best(fill in the blank) I must check it out. Now usually I'll take a gander at something jus so I can try to understand y it's considered great: 2 in particular I'm not a fan of include Pulp Fiction and Annie Hall. But I digress, this movie was well worth the years it took me to finally watch, had it on the DVR since March. All of the acting is absolutely stellar. I would say I hope an amazing story told on celluloid would encourage people to treat one another better, but given the state of things in parts of the world I'll say we're a long way from that.

Even with 7 Oscars, deserved more. On par with the greatest films ever made. Certainly cemented Steven as one of the greatest filmmakers to walk the planet. A personal labor by Steven, it is clearly something he felt compelled to do, and it shows in the intricate detail of every scene. ""Schindler's List"" is nearly flawless in every category. A must-see film for reasons beyond entertainment.🙏","

"Hitchcoc","28 March 2006","We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country.","

"TheLittleSongbird","4 June 2009","Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox.","

"classicsoncall","18 October 2006","Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'.","

"troy-manatunga","29 June 2016","SCHINDLERS LIST is Jewel.Evil and indifference we see all around us every day. And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm – Michael Wilmington 93'The brutal realism of WWII, countless crimes against humanity and the darkest journey imaginable is breathed into life in this epic adaptation based on the true story of Oskar Schindler. Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware. As the war comes with the Germany losing, the SS begins moving its prisoners Westward to remaining camps. Oskar Schindler invests heavily on Jewish workforce by bribing the SS for his own interest. As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at. Enigmatic is where I am left as the end credits roll up embracing me with its moving score.What took me so long to watch this? Is something I keep asking my self now. Profound Beauty! If you appreciate art, this is a masterpiece.TITLE: SCHINDLERS LIST DIRECTED BY: STEVEN SPIELBERG STARRING: LIAM NEESON, BEN KINGSLEY & RALPH FIENNES RATED:R RATING: 09/10 RUNTIME: 195 Minutes","

"RossRivero99","16 May 2014","Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created.","

"zaremskya-23761","23 October 2017","The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget.","

"ASuiGeneris","16 June 2017","'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed.","

Regardless of how much praise I include in my review, I should still think it deserves more.

Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there.

"Docterry","31 March 1999","I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever.","

"Come-and-Review","24 September 2017","The first time I've seen it, Schindler's list didn't give me much of an impression. It was horrific, black and white, and I was 15. Now, after I got myself quite a cinematographic culture, feeling the urge to identify Spieblerg's masterpiece, I came back to this movie. I knew it was rated as one of the best films generally, ever, but when I took a look at the reviews, I became really worried. Most of the 1/10 ratings bring reasonless motivations for this film's criticism. The main points of criticism that I saw are the following: 1) it manipulates facts; 2) presents a too distinct line between good jews and evil Nazis; 3) too emotional; 4) money grab; 5) ""Holocaust is bad, we already knew it"" (and this is an almost exact quote);1) the claims for this point of criticism are that it portrays a positive figure of Oskar Schindler, exaggerates several aspects of the holocaust, and portrays essentially bad Nazis (we to this latter point in 2)); Let's get this straight: unlike some reviewers claim, Oskar Schindler didn't end up as an enriched Industrialist, as some reviewers wrongly claim. In other words, he didn't earn off the holocaust anything. On the contrary, he spent his entire fortune on bribes and corruption acts in order to aid his Jewish workers. He even had to escape to Argentina, as many Nazi officers did after WWII. As for the claims of overly dramatisation, that is certainly an aspect of the film. There are a few scenes which are not accurate (e.g. the shower scene - in real life, jews didn't fear the gas chamber as they where purposely misinformed). Generally, though, I didn't see that much of an overly dramatization. Most of the times, the film presented simply factual events. Jews were in fact killed and persecuted, there's nothing overly dramatized. Concentration camps where truly such bloody places as seen in the film. Instead, maybe it even downgraded violence quite a lot., still being incredibly bloody as a film.2) Good jews vs. bad Nazis; I remember Hans Landa's monologue from the beginning of Inglorious Basterds, which centered on jews being rats in the sense that they're generally a population that could figure out a solution easily. Do not get me wrong here (obviously Landa stereotypes this immensely), but this is portrayed often, mainly in the first portion of the film. Jews going to the Synagogue to buy and sell instead of praying, some jews that join the police force and essentially collaborate with the Nazis, and some jews fight each other when hiding away during the ghetto persecution scene. I clearly would not say that all jews are good nor that all German soldiers are bad, but that shouldn't be a matter to be portrayed in a holocaust film. To see an avid jew, go watch ""A Christmas Carol"". As for ""bad Nazis"", I'd like to clear out again what is Nazional-Socialism. It was an extremist, right-wing movement that enhanced, in this case, Germany's national identity and superiority on the base of racial distinction, and urged violence on anyone that would not be member of the ""superior"" race. This movement, along with fascism, attracted a great deal of fanatics. I'd like to suggest the view of ""Novecento"", which similarly depicts the rise of fascism in Italy and its ruthless cruelty, carried on by it he insane and violent individuals which joined the party in the early twenties. I know that one movie depicted a Nazi soldier's moral division during WWII, called ""Onore e Lealtà"", which has low reviews for the same reason that prevents this film from portraying ""good"" Nazis: it is kind of dangerous, and can easily turn in a glorification of Nazis. Nonetheless, most of the cruelty is carried through a notorious war criminal, Amon Goeth. 3) Spielberg is of Jewish origins. As a filmmaker, he's considered this story very personal. Moreover, he is notorious for being emotional in his serious films. 4) It is well known that Spielberg chose to renounce for his fee as he considered it ""blood money"". Of course studios have to do a profit of their movies, but film is still a form of art. Movie makers of Spielberg's caliber do films without a simple capitalistic view of making money, but with the purpose of making an art work. Schindler's list is not a fancy action blockbuster, if nothing else, its black and white colouring identifies it as an art film. Add the fact the Spielberg felt personal about this story, and you'll realise how empty this claim is.5) This film was released in 1993; I personally don't know many outstanding holocaust films from before 1993 (certainly a lot from after 1993), or if there were, they certainly weren't as bold as this one. A black and white film about a crude subject that keeps the viewer's attention for 3 hours and 15 minutes. Think about it. I personally believe that, unlike other films (this includes my favourite holocaust film, Son of Saul), gives a such wide view on the holocaust. This film shows most of the aspects of the holocaust, some overrdramatised, but nonetheless represented. It is really stupid to see this movie as unnecessary. Conclusively, I'd like to point out that 6 million jews died due to the Holocaust. The only bigger genocide I know of is that of the native Americans, 18 million only in northen America. Seeing so many 1/10 reviews that base their claims on this being basically Jewish propaganda is worrying, especially considering the rise of right-wing ideologies that happened in the latter years. Are we forgetting history? I hope not. And, in case that's the truth, it's films like Schindler's list that remind us of that.","

"Leofwine_draca","16 May 2017","SCHINDLER'S LIST is perhaps one of the ultimate anti-war movies in existence. Directed by Steven Spielberg in a naturalistic, unfussy style, it's a harsh, black and white epic that looks at the extermination of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis. Some humanity is brought to the fold by an excellent Liam Neeson who plays Oskar Schindler, a businessman who somehow found himself involved in the situation and who did the right thing. Like many Spielberg films, this is shamelessly sentimental, but then it can hope to be nothing else given the subject matter. The stirring music combines with the expert direction to make this an effortless watch, complemented by Ralph Fiennes whose role is the personification of evil.","

"ving13","5 August 1998","An incredible movie.  One thing that stands out in my mind about this classic film is the great characterization of all the players due to superb acting, directing, and scripting.  Ralph Fiennes character is especially vile but at the same time human.  He may be 95% evil but to not present a stereotypical and archetypical 100% bad character makes him infinately more realistic.  Filmed in black and white, this story certainly shows the shades of gray that is the duality of man.  This is further exemplified by Schindler's own declaration of being a bad person because he could have done more good and saved more lives.","

Spielberg not only makes you feel like you're in the middle of it, but you continue feeling that way for hours after watching the movie. Liam Neeson does a top-notch job as Oskar Schindler, a man caught between loyalty to his government and the desire to save over 1,000 people. Equally good is Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, whom Schindler saves from getting exterminated, and then helps Schindler save more people. And Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, a Nazi Kommandant with plans to rape a Jewish woman. Like I said, I can't possibly describe how great this movie is. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO UNDERSTAND IT. 11/10.","

"Anonymous_Maxine","2 April 2002","Steven Spielberg's epic portrayal of the Nazi Holocaust is one of the most powerful films ever brought to the big screen. During production, Spielberg is said to have stood in the cold on location in Austria and cried, being partly Jewish, as he imagined the horrors that all of those people suffered during the second World War under the oppression of the Nazis. It is clear that at least some of this emotion transferred over into the film, and the end result is startlingly effective and moving. Sure, Spielberg has had several other films that have been amazing and memorable, not the least of which, obviously, are ones like Saving Private Ryan and Amistad (oh shut up, Amistad rocked), but in my opinion, the shocking realism achieved in large part through the documentary style filmmaking gives Schindler's List the boost needed to surpass the also brutally realistic Saving Private Ryan.The story involves a Nazi who exercised his humanity and attempted to free as many Jews as possible from being killed in the concentration camps. Steven Spielberg has been often criticized for being overly sappy or emotional in his films (this was, of course, long before Spielberg himself criticized Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful for virtually the same thing), and this may have happened in Schindler's List as well, but in this case, if he was sappy it was for good reason and with great effect. At the end of the film, Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler has saved a tremendous amount of people who would otherwise have died, but he doesn't seem to notice this as he emotionally laments all of the possessions that he still has that could have been used to save peoples' lives. This is especially effective because of the fact that he was a much more materialistic opportunist at the beginning of the film before he began to pay attention to his conscience.
As he did with Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg creates a film with Schindler's List that is absolutely unflinching. He does not shy away from the horrific things that happened to the victims in the concentration camps, and he does not sugar-coat his presentation of it at all. The time period is re-created and brought to the screen with stunning and disturbing realism, and if it weren't for the quality of the presentation, it could almost seem that we are watching stock footage of the concentration camps themselves rather than a scripted and edited film. Spielberg's emphasis on the emotional element of his films comes into play most powerfully in the closing scene of the film, as a very long line of people  the descendents of those that he saved during the war  walk through a cemetery in the modern day and place flowers on his grave. Schindler was unsatisfied when the war ended because he felt that he could have, and should have, saved more people, but during this scene it becomes abundantly clear that he really made a difference, and that his accomplishments were important and long-lasting. With Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg once again demonstrates his tremendous skills as a filmmaker. 1993 is a testament to Spielberg's filmmaking skills, because this was the year that he directed Schindler's List, the Best Picture of the year, as well as Jurassic Park, which was the most popular film of the year. These two films are a perfect example of the two main types of films that Spielberg is so adept at creating. There are the fun and exciting films, like Jurassic Park, E.T., Hook, the Indiana Jones films, and the more recent A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and then there are the films that are historically accurate and are made to deliver powerful messages to the world in reference to the events portrayed in the film, such as Amistad, Saving Private Ryan and, probably his most powerful yet, Schindler's List.","

"bkoganbing","16 November 2008","It would not have been possible to have made Schindler's List immediately after World War II. The public was just taking in the magnitude of the Holocaust, they might not have believed it. Fortunately for the prosecutors at Nuremberg and for history the Nazis being the anal retentives that they were, made these incredibly meticulous records which scholars and historians have sifted through and we have the whole thing incredibly documented by the perpetrator's own hand. With a fifty year perspective now and the very existence of the state of Israel questioned by those who ought to know better, Steven Spielberg has given us a work for the ages.If you can sit through two incredibly long and sorrowful films one ought to see Schindler's List back to back with The Diary Of Anne Frank. In the latter film, we see a very ordinary group of people fighting for survival to escape the fate of what we see happened to so many. The fact they were days from possible liberation makes the sorrow of that film all the more poignant.Schindler's List is a story of escape from the ultimate fate of six million. Oskar Schindler played by Liam Neeson is a German businessman who sees a chance at some nice war profits using some incredibly cheap labor from the concentration camps. He's willing to start a factory in occupied Poland with slave labor Jews. Towards that end he hears of a man who ran a factory among the Jews in the newly formed Cracow ghetto, Itzak Stern played by Ben Kingsley. Kingsley agrees to work for him and with him recruiting the labor force, Neeson gets his factory going. With that comes responsibility for these people. He fights for them, the original ones and some added to his growing work force. Over the over 3 hour film, Neeson gradually changes and his concern for his charges becomes humanitarian. He plays a dangerous game, especially with concentration camp commandant Ralph Fiennes. A man who delights in the total power he's been handed and the liberation from all civilized restraints to exercise barbarism, arbitrary and capricious. Fiennes will chill you with his penultimate portrayal of a perfect Nazi.Let us not forget that Schindler himself was a Nazi. He did in fact in the end go broke in paying out bribes for special consideration for his charges that meant their very lives. It's also possible that he saw the way the war would end and that those responsible for the Holocaust would be held accountable. Some have speculated that he did this for no other reason than to bank credit with possible witnesses. If that was the case it certainly worked because he was investigated and not charged with any war crimes.Still I'd prefer to believe the testimony of those on the scene including the real life Itzak Stern. Those are the folks that ought to know.Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture and Best Director for Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. It deserved every honor it got and I only wish Neeson and Fiennes were winners as well.It's a film about the Holocaust, but it's also a film about the results of dehumanization of a people and when the state completes the process of dehumanization what can be the result. I'm not sure what future work Steven Spielberg has planned, but he can't top this no way, no how.","

"ackstasis","9 February 2007","The Holocaust is undoubtedly one of the most significant and horrifying events of the twentieth century. Between 1938 and 1945, the Jewish population was segregated and persecuted, culminating in the merciless slaughter of approximately six million Jews (this figure is quoted in the film, though most historical estimates vary between five and seven million). Amidst all this butchery, one man decided to make a difference, famously saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews- men, women and children who would otherwise have been killed.Oskar Schindler (played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, ""Batman Begins"") was a Sudeten German industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't afraid to throw his money around. Always bearing his Nazi Party badge proudly, Schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly showering high-ranked Nazi officers and their girlfriends with champagne and caviar. With impeccable connections in the black-market, there was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good person to know. Buying friends was something that Schindler could do well, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own business ventures. When thousands of the Polish Jew population was relegated to the Kraków Ghetto in 1941, Schindler saw an opportunity for further success, enlisting desperate Jewish investors and employing Jewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an enamelware factory. His connections in high places ensured lucrative army contracts, and Schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering it ""a certain panache.""It is clear from the beginning that Oskar Schindler does not harbour any racial prejudices. When Schindler requests the services of Itzhak Stern (a superb Ben Kingsley, ""Gandhi""), a clever, humanitarian Jewish accountant, Stern declares that, ""By law I have to tell you, sir, I'm a Jew."" ""Well, I'm a German, so there we are,"" replies Schindler indifferently, before getting straight to business. It is not race that he is concerned with, it is himself and, of course, his money. Stern does not enjoy running Schindler's business, and he initially acquires little satisfaction from it. When Schindler attempts to convey his genuine gratitude for his profitable services with a glass of whiskey, Stern absentmindedly refuses to drink it, and an embittered Schindler drinks it himself before ordering Stern to leave.With the arrival of Amon Goeth (played as the epitome of evil by Ralph Fiennes, ""Red Dragon""), a Hauptsturmführer of the SS, the hopeless plight of the Jews grows darker. In a harrowing extended sequence, largely based on the testimonies of Holocaust survivors, the Jews are mercilessly ""liquidated"" from the Krakow Ghetto, many simply shot on the spot. ""Today is history,"" proclaims Goeth. ""Today will be remembered. Years from now the young will ask with wonder about this day. Today is history and you are part of it. For six centuries there has been a Jewish Krakow. By this evening those six centuries will be a rumor. They never happened. Today is history.""This sequence also marks the celebrated appearance of the little girl in the red coat. An ingenious plot device, the character was based upon a real girl named Roma Ligocka who, unlike her film counterpart, survived the war, and wrote a memoir entitled ""The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir"". The embodiment of innocence, Schindler spots the small girl wandering amongst the black-and-white chaos of the Krakow Ghetto, and we follow her as she retreats into a building and takes shelter under a bed. When Schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted past him to be incinerated, he is understandably horrified, unable to understand how the soldiers could possibly destroy something so innocent. This event memorably signifies the turning-point of Schindler's attitudes towards the carnage, fuelling his desire to save as many Jews as possible.Long known as a ""blockbuster"" filmmaker  with such adventure classics as ""Jaws,"" ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" to his name - ""Schindler's List"" was - and remains - Steven Spielberg's most mature directorial effort. Working with a screenplay that Steven Zaillian adapted from Thomas Keneally's Booker Prize-winning 'Schindler's Ark,' Spielberg treats the subject matter with the respect it deserves. Wisely choosing to depict the events as realistically as possible, Spielberg allows the images to speak for themselves. Flawless acting, stunning cinematography and a haunting John Williams score excel this film above all others of the 1990s. This is the powerful story of the difference that just one man can make, and it is a story that deserves to be seen by all. We can only feel grateful that it was Steven Spielberg who chose to be at the helm.","

"bob the moo","23 March 2003","As Nazi Germany invades Poland, opportunist Oscar Schindler sees a chance to open a factory serving the military and using Jews for labour.  However, as the full horror of the war on the Jewish people becomes ever more clear, Schindler's selfishness turns more into compassion for his fellowman.Having spent 10 weeks watching `Taken' and remembering just how awful Spielberg can be when he is being mushily sentimental, I revisited this film as it was showing in the build up to the TV coverage of the 2003 Oscar ceremony.  It is a powerful film simply because Spielberg manages to keep the mush out of it and just let the events speak for themselves.  When people are shot on the street there is no John Williams music or slow-motion, they simply fall in a bloody heap and the film moves on.  This makes it shockingly cold and that is the aim.The story is difficult to summarise because a surprising amount of it is spent away from the story of Schindler and on the plight of the Jews generally.  Again this theme within the narrative stops to wandering and allows it to be impacting.  True there is an element of `look what happened, isn't this terrible?' about it, but not too much.  In the final hour in particular it gets a little sentimental but not to the point of spoiling things.Neeson's Schindler makes you wonder why he wasn't able to get any character into his recent role in Star Wars I.  Here he keeps Schindler a complex man, driven by a mix of selfishness and compassion but Spielberg simplifies him a bit towards the end (but I may be being a bit picky).  Fiennes' Goeth is also wonderfully drawn.  A cold blooded killer no doubt but also not painted without his own complexities and Fiennes holds the focus whenever he is onscreen.  The support cast are all excellent right down to extras  if you think it is easy to scream and wail convincingly then you should compare this to Kate Capshaw in Indiana Jones!  I never doubted that any of the actors were anything but the characters they played.Spielberg rightly won his Oscars for this and his direction is excellent. Although I do dislike him immensely when he goes all `apple pie' on us, he is great at what he does and this is one of his best films since Jaws.  A powerful, moving film that is moving for all the right reasons and not just because John Williams cranks in.  Difficult to watch but worth the effort.","

"jay-techie2007","22 August 2016","It is only twice that I have watched this movie and it definitely is one of the classics of Hollywood. Probably the finest work (and undoubtedly one of the finest) of Steven Spielberg till date. In the backdrop of Nazi-occupied Poland, Schindler's List comprises of Jews who are to be saved by an otherwise greedy and flamboyant businessman but a transformed humanitarian, Oskar Schindler. Story (10/10): The story is based on Thomas Keneally's 1982 novel ""Schindler's Ark"". It is a story of a German businessman who went all out to save the Jews who were being massacred by the Nazi army post-invasion of Poland. While, initially, he employed the Jews to make quick money by exploiting them. However, the views of people being needlessly killed by the Nazi army evokes the human inside him and that's when he decides to do whatever possible to save as many lives as possible. And while doing that, he not only has to manage the secrecy of the purpose but also justify the purpose of every single Jew in his company to the bloodthirsty Nazi army. The screenplay is brilliant and it couldn't have been better adapted from the novel. Acting (9/10): Liam Neeson, playing the title role, was effortless in the projection of a greedy, money-minded and a womanizer businessman in the beginning of the movie and an emotional, humanitarian later on. One of the toughest scenes was when he is watching the Jewish massacre from the top of a hill - and his expressions in that scene told a thousand words, something which is very tough. It was quite a challenging role and Liam executes it like a boss. Besides Liam, another actor that stood out in the movie was Ralph Fiennes. His role and quality of acting reminded me of the role of Christopher Waltz in Inglorious Bastards. Playing a role of a cruel Nazi commandant of the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp in Płaszów (German-occupied Poland), he was brilliant in his cold looks and depiction of hatred towards the Jews. Ben Kingsley was commendable in his role of Jewish accountant of Oskar Schindler. His depiction of a hesitating, unsure and under-confident person (yet rising to the occasion whenever the situation demands), largely due to the circumstances around him, was brilliant. Direction (9/10): I loved the idea of Steven Spielberg shooting this movie in B/W which provided it a vintage feel as well as a slightly dull projection which was necessary considering the subject of the movie. SS has been great with the actors and he brings the best out of it. One negative for me was the length of the movie which was too long, especially when you have such a heavy topic. Conceptualization of some of the scenes are so brilliant they stay on your mind long after you have watched the movie - something I felt when I watched ""12 Angry Men"". Overall (9/10): Definitely, one of the classics in Hollywood, and a must-watch movie, if you love a little heavy but a top quality cinema.","

"colewaters","7 June 2016","Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited off of slave labor. The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men. He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business. But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered. That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer). At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't. This film is a must see by me. I give the film an ""A+"" (wishing I could give it a higher grade than that) and a 10 out of 10... Best movie","

"rmax304823","23 October 2007","Steven Spielberg, until the appearance of this film, was rightly noted mainly for his child's view of movies, fast action, easy sentiment, and a generally accurate sense of appeal to fantasy and wish fulfillment. He pretty much discarded that sort of innocence here, without leaving behind his appreciation of the commercial value of a story.It's impossible not to be deeply moved. The extermination program of the Nazis was the most horrific offense to human morality of the 20th century, and one of the worst in history. It wasn't the worst of the slaughters. The two world wars qualified for those honors. It wasn't even the worst example of ethnic cleansing, as it's come to be called. But more than six million Jews and more than seven million other undesirables -- homosexuals, the mentally ill, gypsies, political dissidents -- perished in the camps and not a single Jewish family in Europe went untouched. And it wasn't a war in which the victims were fighting back. It was a deliberate and very thorough act of genocide on the part of a people that Madame de Stael once described as ""a nation of poets and dreamers.""It's a kind of ""cross-over"" movie in which the protagonist is not Jewish but rather a Christian who comes to their rescue. A basically decent man comes to his senses. This is the formula, whether the despised and abused minority are Jews or African-Americans. If it were otherwise, there would be a danger of this being seen somehow as a ""Jewish"" movie by the unenlightened masses and, as a consequence, might suffer at the box office. Better ""In the Heat of the Night"" than ""Superfly."" But Spielberg has avoided most of the clichés associated with films of the final solution. No voice overs telling us of the suffering. No stock footage of bull dozers plowing corpses into mass graves. For the most part, the story stays at the personal level. (We hear hardly anything of the progress of the war.) And it's at this level that the film excels, due to the mature script and the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Feinnes. There are many other characters, including Embeth Davidtz.The film is good because Neason's character begins not as a racist or a humanitarian but as a moral nihilist. He cares about nothing but money and the sensory pleasures it affords. He couldn't care less about the Jews, or about the Nazis either for that matter. The war to him is just a way of making a profit using cheap labor. And the script rises above the formulaic in not giving him a moment of epiphany. At no point does his brow furrow, his eyes light up, and he thinks to himself, ""My God, what am I doing?"" Nope. Instead, his development is informed by minor but important insights distributed here and there. After the surrender, he leaves the camp as a fugitive, dressed in prison clothes, mourning his carelessness in not saving more lives.Spielberg tells the story in a straightforward way but of course some incidents and dialog from events of fifty years ago must be fabricated. And the fabrications are well done. Especially enjoyable is the touchy, sometimes abrasive, and often humorous relationship between Neason, the salesman and con man who simply has no head for business, and Ben Kingsley as the matter-of-fact accountant who does. I'd give examples of some exchanges but there isn't space.Spielberg hasn't quite gotten over his taste for easy sentimentality. There are only two touches of color in this black-and-white movie. A little girl in a rose-colored coat appears two or three times, so that we can know who it is when her body is wheeled past in a barrow, just another victim. And when the workers hold a ceremony on Shabat, the candle flames are touched with a warm orange that signifies life. Effective, yes, but unnecessary in an adult film like this. Most people watching the film may be trusted to know what's going on without being nudged. But that's small stuff. Somewhat more embarrassing is a scene in which a German officer screams like a maniac and makes gargoyle faces at the camera after emptying his pistol into a mountain of burning bodies. Are we supposed to learn from this that the people running the camps were evil? The Nazi's extermination program prompted many studies in social science, none of which has contributed much to our understanding of why this, and similar programs, seem to be so common around the world. It's easy enough to blame Germany and the SS, but what happened in Kosovo, Maylasia, Cambodia, and Rwanda? Perhaps one of the reasons we've never really understood it is that we don't want to. Perhaps the answer lies not in ""F"" (for ""facism"") scales or ideographic studies of power but in the darkest aspects of human nature itself. Is there a group of people who have nothing in common but their ethnic identity that we ourselves would enjoy seeing wiped off the map? We all have massive cerebral cortices, much of the functions of which seem devoted to damping down impulses from structures lower down on the brain that generate desires to mate, to flee from danger, and to kill things and people that get in our way. Some day science might give us an answer but until then we have to rely on poets like Robert Burns.'Many and sharp the num'rous ills Inwoven with our frame! More pointed still we make ourselves Regret, remorse, and shame! And Man, whose heav'n-erected face The smiles of love adorn, - Man's inhumanity to man Makes countless thousands mourn!","

"Quinoa1984","13 February 2000","Steven Spielberg has his best masterpiece here with Schindler's list.  It is also his most personal work to say the least.  And what he brings to the screen is like nothing the world has ever seen before- a true to life depiction of the horror known as the holocaust.The story brings us Oskar Schindler, a German munitions chief who brings thousands of Polish Jews from the death camps to his factory and saves them. The acting is spectacular with Liam Neeson as Schindler, the man who changes throughout the film, Ben Kigsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant (and conscience), and Ralph Fiennes in his best performance yet as the frightening German commander.  Along with a frighteningly haunting score by John Williams and great Photography by Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg has created a film that will remain with us forever.  Haunting, dramatic and true in the art form, this is one of the best masterpieces of cinema ever made.","

"ccthemovieman-1","25 December 2006","This isn't much I can add to what hasn't been said or written some dozen years after this was released. It's still one of the most powerful stories ever put on film, mainly because it's based on fact. Since it's Hollywood, you don't know how much of this is true but the Holocaust certainly is and that's enough. The little details don't matter.This movie features extremely good acting by the three leads: Liam Neson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley. Fiennes is particularly good as the Nazi villain. He's downright scary and one of the most rotten, despicable human beings ever put on film....but that was the intent. I don't know if his character (or lack of it) was exaggerated since this was made by a famous Jewish filmmaker (Steven Spielberg) who has made the Nazis look as bad as possible in a number of his movie (not that they don't deserve it!). Nonetheless, Fiennes' portrayal of ""Amon Goeth"" is one you'll remember. You'll want to punch this idiot right in the nose.Neeson, in the title role as ""Oskar Schlinder,"" is intriguing as the industrialist who slowly sees immoral things happening that the become too repulsive for him to support. For much of the film, he still isn't a ""good guy"" but he certainly comes around and becomes a hero in the end. Neeson's scene near the conclusion when ""Schindler"" parts with ""his"" Jews at the end of the war is extremely moving. It brings tears to my eyes every time. When he agonizes that ""I could have done more,"" it is something all of us could say and probably will some day. That sentence by him haunted me after each viewing.In addition to the moving story, the black-and-white cinematography in here is magnificent. Not many movies today are made in black-and-white and that's too bad because with today's cameras and knowledge, it can look tremendous. (i.e. ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" ""Ed Wood,"" etc.) The camera-work helped draw me back to several viewings.A lot of people would not watch this movie a second time and I can't blame them. It's tough to watch. There are some brutal, harrowing, scenes in here with executions, naked people being led to the gas chambers....just some very disturbing scenes. It should be seen at least once, though, by everyone.","

"Robert_duder","15 June 2002","I had no expectations going into this movie.  I had heard different opinions about it and I was pleasantly blown away by it.  It left me in tears which few movies ever truly do.  I honestly believe this to be one of the top ten greatest films of all time...not necessarily because of it's watchability but because of it's content and the way it is filmed. Liam Neeson (Who I have never been fond of) plays Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party who is a brilliant business man, con artist, and German personality.  He loves his ladies and his booze but is also quite humane right from the very beginning.  When the Germans invade Poland and begin to send Jews into Ghetto's he opens a factory making cookware (pots and pans) using the jews as labor.  However, it isn't cruel labor but rather he is giving them a purpose and treats them as equal workers giving them benefits and good working conditions...to him...he's just making his money.  He is very humble about everything and does not see why the Jews are so happy with him.  As the movie continues we see the honest progression of the war and the hatred towards the Jews.  The rumours of the gas chamber begin to circulate, and we watch as Almon Goeth played chillingly by Ralph Fiennes (another actor I have never been overly fond of) murders Jews at will keeping the other Jews in check by fear.  Goeth is a power hungry, Nazi who thrives on seeing people suffer by his hand.  He's been given a high powered rank and milks it for all it's worth and enjoys it.  He snipers Jews from his window...just for sport.  He's empty and pure evil.  When Schindler happens to oversee a Ghetto raid by the SS he is moved to tears as he watches his workers being brutalized.  As he makes his millions he wields his own more subtle power with bribes, women, food, wine, reputation in order to progress his business and save his workers. He then takes a quite signifigant more direct role by actually buying off top ranking Nazi officials in order to ""buy"" Jewish workers...the workers and their families who worked for him in his cookware plant.  He begins to make a list of 1100 Jewish people he wants bought and brought by train to his new Munitions plant where they are to make shell casings for bombs.  A very intense scene takes place when the Jewish women he ""purchased"" are re-routed to the wrong place because of an error in paper work.  They think that this is it for them and the gas chamber will be their destination but the error is fixed and the women arrive unharmed to Schindler's Plant.  In the most moving scene in movie history...Schindler breaks down before escaping Allied forces at the end of the war and realizes how many had died outside his factory and how many he wished he could have saved.  Liam Neeson performance in this entire movie but especially in that scene will haunt me forever.  This film is never to be tossed on a back shelf...it is so much more than a classic...it's brilliance.  I don't, however, necessarily take it as historical fact when it comes to Schindler. In reading on him I don't see him quite as the beloved character you feel in the movie.  He seemed more selfish and perhaps less humble in real life...but nonetheless the man saved 1100 and then some Jews and that to me makes him a hero no matter what.  This movie though is one no one can ever miss.  It's a triumph!!! 10/10","

"Andres-Camara","25 January 2018","Too bad you can not give a ten because I think nothing is perfect, if I would not give it without hesitation. Spielberg shows again that directing is the best. Narrates like no one and as always uses the camera to make the best shots of the story in every way. With the plans, with the camera tells the story.He tells us a film, in which, although he changes the real story and retouches it to make it more human, since Oskar Schindler used the Jews, as he tells in a sequence, the price of each nationality, which causes us all kinds of feelings.The design of production as always great, he can do it, of course, but there are some who can and do it very badly.All the actors, supported by the magnificent costumes and makeup are great, they seem to be real. Liam's presentation is great, fast and simple.What a way to use ellipses, which are sometimes even fun, like when a woman goes on the train.No matter how much you see it, it will surprise you again.The photography is great, even when we see the girl in red, it may seem simple but I think it is not.The direction, is the own one of someone who dominates to the perfection, the visual narrative. He knows where to put the camera at every moment to tell a story. You do not have time to get bored. He knows when to make a slow plane. Know how to compose so that everything is where it should be and you can have everything in sight. Neither camera movement, nor the plane, nor the short between planes is free.I know it will be noticed that it is my favorite director but I can not help but surrender to someone who, apart from being commercial, is very good, I compare it to a Mercedes or a BMW, they will be commercial but they are good.Spoiler:
It is impressive to see how the sequence in which the architect dies, with a slight movement of camera, characters and staging, is putting everything in place to make you look where you should look. That if it is not going to prohibit you from looking anywhere, everything to focus and everything telling you at once, bring the woman on camera so you can see who is going to be killed while a German drinks a coffee, total symbol of tranquility, for enhance the moment more. What a great genius, moments like that there are many in the movie.","

"sol-","8 January 2005","The most amazing thing about this film is that it was not made to be an epic or an acclaimed film. Spielberg made it as a personal film for himself and other Jews affected by the Holocaust. There is nothing flashy about the film except for Neeson's bravura performance. Spielberg's usual style is invisible, and the cinematography and editing, although excellent, are not shown off to make a spectacle of the film or give it an epic feel. Yet it is still a compulsive, involving, and utterly heart-wrenchingly moving filming of a part of history that should not be forgotten. The screenplay is one of the best ever written: it captures the stories of so many Holocaust survivors but without distracting from the main story at hand. The black and white photography and editing is perfect, and John Williams provides a perfectly subtle but nice music score. The acting is simply brilliant, with Liam Neeson towering as Oskar Schindler, and Ralph Fiennes bringing out the Nazi character Amon Goeth into full flesh. And Ben Kingsley and Embeth Davidtz give off excellent performances too. The film also has a lot to say about absolute power corrupting and spiraling out of control, and such a message of the film can be applied to any time and crisis, not just the Holocaust. This is not just one of the the ten best films ever produced, but it shall remain so for years to come, because its messages in terms of power and racism are applicable in any age.","

The portrayal and setting of WWII is brutally accurate. Spielberg does not shudder from the harsh cruelties that existed at the time. From various vantage points we watch the horror unfold. A film does not need to build towards something as it starts with such a horrible setting, it was the reality at the time. Oscars transformation from an opportunistic businessman to a heroic saviour is one of the best transformations seen in film.As tough as it is to watch it is a beautifully woven masterpiece by Spielberg and one does not know how much time has passed as he/she has been fully immersed in this dark tale and reality. 9/10","

"TxMike","12 December 2004","I'll start with an ""aside."" What is a ""film"" and what is a ""movie."" I take the logical stance most of the time, the crew ""films"" so that the director and editor can create a ""movie"". But I have a difficult time thinking of ""Schindler's List"" as a ""movie."" I didn't watch it to be entertained, no person with a clear vision of the history behind it would. So for me, ""Schindler's List"" is certainly a ""film"", one about a real stain on our human history, a stain placed there solely from religious beliefs. The persecution and attempted extermination of the Jews by the German Nazis.But this ""film"", while its overall subject is the holocaust, is not really about the holocaust. While it revolves around the mistreatment of Jews by the Nazis, it is about the man, Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson. A German, a ""connected"" man in society, he went to Poland and bought a factory, employing cheap Jewish labor, hoping to get rich. He was no humanitarian. But perhaps his biggest weakness, his not being an astute businessman, was responsible for the conversion we see during the course of the three hours running time of the film. He has to rely on a Jew, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), to run his factory. And the rest, as they say, is history. He changes to the point that he risks his own life to save many, perhaps over 1000, Jews from extermination, no longer for profit but for true humanitarian motives.Unique in this time of modern movie-making, this film is mostly in Black and white. For me this works very well, because first it is such a stark subject and second, there is not so much to distract the viewer from the story. Many consider this Spielberg's best directorial effort, probably because as a Jew it was very personal to him. As a viewer, many times I found it difficult to watch, because the scenes are so realistic. I will never forget the scenes of nude prisoners being marched across the prison grounds to their deaths. I give great credit for this film's place in history, but it is not one that I enjoy watching, it is such a reminder how some can be so cruel to those who should be treated as our brothers and sisters.","

"MuviFan73","25 May 2017","Oskar Schindler, when someone judges him at first time may think of him as a moody business man who most important aim is money. His moody nature takes his contacts made, with higher authorities and women. Now this man does the work of saving 1,100 lives.From where I see, he has done a Godly act by saving lives. He sacrifices all of his earned wealth in rescuing Jews and still at end regrets the money he used as bribe for growth of his industry, could have saved more lives.At last I want to just say his moody nature is nothing, in front of lives he saved.","

"bobsgrock","20 May 2008","Steven Spielberg delivers his masterpiece here in telling the very unknown story of a German Nazi Party member who became the savior for over 1100 Jews during the height of the Holocaust. This is very dark material and Spielberg was wise enough to film it in black and white obviously to emphasize the bleakness of the situation. Here all the elements come together and mesh fluidly. The acting is superb with Liam Neeson perfectly capturing the multiple emotional cycles that Schindler went through. At first, he is happy and wealthy yet struggles with the relationship to his wife. As the story progresses, he becomes more saddened and shocked at the horrific events that are taking place on Jews in the local towns of Poland. He then decides to use the immense wealth he has gathered to try and save those that worked for him in Poland before they were moved to concentration camps towards the end of WWII. This is not a happy story at all, and yet there is something so beautiful about this picture. When I first saw it, I cried at multiple scenes. Now, after seeing it for the second time, I was more taken aback and could only watch in awe as a simple German businessman did something that only a handful of human beings would have the courage to do. He went face to face with multiple SS officers, including the demented head of the camp Amon Goeth played sinisterly by Ralph Fiennes, in order to save all he can. The last hour of the film showing Schindler collect all his money together so he can pay for the Jews to move them to safety can only amaze and stun you as we watch one man risk and sacrifice all he owns for the benefit of 110 strangers he knows nothing about. Here it is all about the quality of human life and how important one person can be to so many others. This truly is one of the greatest films ever made and it is in my mind the best of the last decade. Not to be missed by anyone, Schindler's List is more than a film; it is an experience of a n event that I pray will never occur again.","

I am glad that it won a lot of Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson is an excellent in that film also. Neeson stars as a Nazi Czech/German businessman named Oskar Schindler who owns a factory and saved more than 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. Concentration camp is a very bad place where people work on digging the dirt from sunrise to sunset. It is a sad film, but it is based on a true story and it is brilliant, too. ""Schindler's List"" is a movie that should be seen for any Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Steven Spielberg, or any historical drama film or movie fans. Excellent! Tragic Ending with Jews putting rocks on Oskar Schindler's gravestone in the cemetery.10/10","

"Rawal_Afzal","13 July 2016","Before I proceed to add any comments on the film, I must simply salute to this great human-being. Compassion and love is the most natural state of us humans, any other emotions of hatred, rage and violence are an alteration of our very being and existence. It is most commendable of Mr. Schindler to have stuck to his natural state amidst all the violence and the preaching of extreme hatred for Jews, amidst a world war to put it best. It is a perception that rich people care the least about the poor and the suffering, but above all is God Almighty's unbeatable Law of descending good people amongst bad people, and vice versa, and here he descended an angel in the form of a rich business, the best option, for the Jews who'd been suffering hopelessly. I smiled when he said to his secretary that if the German army becomes suspicious of the incompetent works done in his factory he'd buy ammunition and weapons from some other factory and then sell it to the army to keep things in control. A masterminded person!It was so touching and heartening to see him instead of feeling satisfied at his achievement or taking pride in it, he chose to cry and curse himself for having not saved even more lives and for not having used earlier opportunities to take this path. He cursed his rich lifestyle and the expensive things he bought for himself instead of spending even more money to save even more lives. Truly a sign of a great human-being who chose to reflect on his flaws instead of the good works he did, which itself was a huge, huge risk that could've cost him not only his status, business and money but also life if the army could've got even a minor sniff of it.On the film, since it was based on true events I can't really find faults and point to things they could've done differently. So no issues with it. However, two things annoyed me a bit, the first of which being it being in black and white. It prevented me from getting a good feel of the atmosphere, the surroundings and the whole drama. I felt as if I was looking at the screen from a place very far. So this wasn't a smart move on Spielberg's part in my view. By the way, I mean no disrespect to the films of years ago which were in black and white anyway. They'd to be shot that way and you as a viewer understood the limitation of the film-maker, but that can't be said of a film released in 1993.Secondly, although I fully admit that the film had to be full in every detail and very spread out with explanatory scenes, but still feel it could've been shortened at least by 20 minutes. Three hours is just way to long for a film of which its entertainment value is its least strength.In general, films on suffering and pain shouldn't be that long, never. Since such films are low on entertainment, the aim should be to make the viewer stayed focused throughout, and if the film turns out to be as long as three hours then somewhere in the middle of it you'll find the viewers scratching their head, looking left and right, talking to others in order to re-find their focus after a few minutes break. In short, such films should be shorter in length.","

Emilie Schindler / Jonathan Sagall ... Poldek Pfefferberg (as Jonathan Sagalle) Embeth Davidtz ... Helen Hirsch Schindler is a vainglorious and greedy German businessman who becomes an unlikely humanitarian amid the barbaric German Nazi reign when he feels compelled to turn his factory into a refuge for Jews. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, it is a testament to the good in all of us he bribed the Germans into giving him people to work in his factory in which they were supposed to make arms but keep them alive Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.Yes, both were very real. The Plaszów labor camp was located in a southern suburb of Kraków and was presided over by the real Amon Göth. Under Göth's command, many thousands of Jews were killed there, it is documented that Göth was every bit as cruel and psychotic as the film depicts him. Schindler's factory, Deutsche Emailewaren-Fabrik, also existed in the Kraków city limits. Schindler's efforts to bring Jewish prisoners to work in his factory are also documented. There's an old saying; ""You have to spend money to make money."". Schindler was schmoozing with the local Nazi & SS officers to build a customer and contact base. He'd already made plans to open the Emailwarenfabrik factory & supply the German army with cookware but he needed to find the right people to sell his product to, IE, all the officers that frequented the restaurant. You can see him working up the chain of officers that come into the place. Schindler (at least in the film) is presented as not only very charming but also very cultured -- he orders appetizers & entrees that appear to be crowd-pleasing & converses with the Maitre'd about the right wine for his guests. At the end of the scene we see him having a drink with Oberführer Julian Scherner, who is the highest ranking officer that enters the place -- his rank is that of a senior colonel. If Schindler is able to, at the very least, strike up a friendship with this man, then Scherner will be likely to throw business Schindler's way through the other officers under his command. Schindler's strategy pays off well; he picks up a lot of business & begins making a lot of money.Schindler wasn't completely broke when he arrived in Krakow. You can see, while he picks out his outfit for the evening, that he has lots of Polish zlotys stashed in various places. Schindler is also a very shrewd businessman, as we see throughout the course of the film. He'd be the type of person to know how to stretch his money during dinner to accommodate his guests, however he did lavish on them quite a lot to gain their trust and friendship. Also, the restaurant management might also have, later in the evening, recognized Oskar to be a trustworthy customer and may have let him run a tab for his dinner expenses. Schindler could have easily paid them back later with a budget of$22,000,000 (estimated) it made a lot of money in in America $96,067,179 Steven Spielberg makes one of (if not the one) his greatest movies of all time. Liam Neeson gives a great performance as Schindler and the whole film is just powerful, amazing and sad but it doesn't matter because the movie is so good. Ralph Fiennes makes an even better performance as Goeth, a man who made everyone stare into the screen with anger and sadness and that is just what a movie is supposed to do-make you feel sad, happy, angry or effect you in some way. I read that someone thought it was overrated and bad, but I think it's a classic and it'll never go away. So if you want to see one of the greatest historical films ever made, then go buy Schindler's List.","

"thinker1691","11 September 2009","Too often the history of the Second World War concentrates on the massive destruction between the countries involved. It is true nearly 25 million people were killed, but the most horrendous tally in human cost was suffered by a single race and they were European Jews. Anyone who Denys this is not only a fool, but a historical moron as well. There is so much irrefutable evidence to disprove them it's simply ludicrous to try. In this film "" Schinder's List "", director Steven Spielberg lays it out cinematically for all to see. The film has so many notable qualities, it's difficult to say which illuminated it the most. The story is based on the real life of humanitarian Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who began the war as a Nazi sympathizer and profiter, but soon realized his Nazi friends were murdering millions, on behalf of the most damnable doctrine ever created. Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) plays the courageous bookkeeper who not only kept Schindeler's files, but helped him to save the lives of thousands. The heavy, Amon Goeth is played despicably evil by Ralph Fiennes. It is very interesting that during the war, ten of thousands were proud to be Nazi soldiers and SS men, yet after the war, you couldn't find two who would own up to their murderous atrocities. Still the movie has garnered so much acclaim and honor, it has become a tribute to Spielberg and his effort to remember the Hollocaust and the saddest chapter in human history. With no effort at all this has become a Classic in every sense of the word. *****","

"Loving_Silence","7 August 2010","I know many of you, out there will disagree with me, when I say that  Schindler's List is one of the greatest film that there has ever been.  It does sound that I'm extremely overrating it, but I truly believe  that Schindler's List is up there with The Godfather and Citizen Kane I  mean everything about is so good, that its close to perfection.  The acting is brilliant, every actor does an amazing job. Liam Neeson  as Schindler is incredible, no doubt about it. He should of won an  Oscar for Best Actor. Ralph Fiennes is the one, who truly is the best  actor in the film. He plays his antagonist role as Amon Goeth, so well  that it is a travesty, he didn't win an Oscar for Best Supporting  Actor.  I'm happy though, that the Academy chose this film for Best Picture, it  was one of the best decisions they ever made. Because if this film  wasn't considered Best Picture by the Academy, I don't know which film  would be, expect maybe for The Godfather.  Steven Spielberg certainly deserved an Oscar for Best Director. It was  a smart idea for Steven Spielberg to make this film in black-white  because it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness. But you  see small patches of color -- A candle and a child's coat bringing the  evilness of the tragedy into a agonizing focus.  There's no doubt about it, this film will be a classic in decades, even  hundreds of years to come in cinema. This film is without a doubt, the  Best film that Spielberg has ever made. With many other Steven  Spielberg's classics like Jurassic Park,Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost  Ark, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler's List will always be Steven  Spielberg's most finest, important film. He blends his humanism to the  tragic horror of the Holocaust to create an emotional masterpiece.  10/10 Absolutely Recommended!","

"willwoodmill","17 February 2016","In the early 90s Steven Spielberg had built a reputation as being the master of kid-friendly family films like E.T., Jaws, The Indiana Jones trilogy, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Hook, the list just goes on and on. Sure today he has films like Munich and Saving Private Ryan under his belt so Spielberg making a non kid-friendly film isn't very strange to us, but back then it was unheard of. So considering his previous career, Schindler's List might be the biggest departure from style any director has made in the history of film making. Even if you are among the more ""experienced"" film goers, meaning people who have seen several incredibly violent, disgusting, and down right disturbing films, Schindler's List will still make your stomach turn, and you'll want to look away at some of the more graphic moments in the film. Stephen Spielberg really does not hold back, and tries to give an uncompromising depiction of the holocaust, which in the earlier 90s was not something that was commonly done, sure you had films like Night and Fog, and Shoah, but your average, everyday Joe wasn't going to ever see those films. And there were films like Sophie's Choice, and Judgement at Nuremberg, but they really focused on the after math, and didn't really directly confront their audience the same way that Schindler's List so boldly did.Schindler's List is a biopic about Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, who is runs a factory, in German occupied Poland, that uses Jews as workers. Oskar Schindler is played ever so greatly by Liam Neeson in what is definitely his best role yet (in my opinion Tom Hanks robbed him of the best actor Oscar). One of the best things about Schindler's List is the character of Oskar Schindler, Oskar Schindler was obviously not a righteous hero throughout the entirety of the film. After all he was a member of the Nazi party, and some viewers may take issue with this, but the film would be so much more dull and lose its complexity and depth, if Schindler was a straight forward hero fighting the bad guys. The way Stephen Spielberg presents it is far more interesting, (after all Stephen Spielberg said he was drawn to the paradoxical nature of Oskar Schindler) and far more accurate to the real life Oskar Schindler, and accuracy is something that Schindler's List strives for. The film was based upon the real life testimonies and accounts of the people who survived the events. Steven Spielberg at first did not want to direct Schindler's List, he didn't think he was ""mature"" enough to handle something as serious as a holocaust film. But eventually decided to do it himself when he saw the rising number of holocaust deniers. Which is probably why he also wanted the film to be as close to reality as possible, he wanted something that would challenge the audience, confront them with the true horrors of the holocaust. Earlier I talked about how great Liam Neeson's performance was, but Ben Kingsley, (who plays a Jewish account, who works for Oskar Schindler) and Ralph Fiennes (who plays an S.S. Officer in charge of a work camp.) both do amazing jobs, Ralph Fiennes was even nominated for best supporting actor at the academy awards. The cinematography, done by Janusz Kaminski who would later do Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report, is also perfect, it is probably among the greatest looking contemporary black & white films out there. The film is also scored by the legendary John Williams, (which is all you really need to know) after John Williams first saw the film, he said it was to beautiful and he was not worthy to score it, the only people that were worthy were dead. Schindler's List won the academy award for both cinematography and soundtrack. Schindler's List was also the first time Steven Spielberg ever won an actual Oscar. (he had previously won the Irving G. Thalberg award but that is just a lifetime achievement award.) Schindler's List was films on a relatively small budget of 22 million dollars, and Steven Spielberg did not accept any money for making the film, he said it would be like accepting blood money. But you would never be able to guess that Schindler's List was shot on a budget a 1/3 of the size of Jurassic Park. The sets are so massive and pay such close attention to detail, and the film was actually shot in the real life locations of where it takes place. The reason Schindler's List was shot on such a small budge was because the Steven Spielberg and the producers thought a holocaust film might bomb, and Steven Spielberg was not known for making R rated films. The film did not bomb it grossed over 320 million dollars world wide, which is over 1/2 a billion dollars in 2016 dollars. I'm not going to pretend that Schindler's List is flawless, perhaps its biggest flaw is the fact that 90% of the film is in English, which really clashes with Spielberg's intent to keep the film as close to reality as possible, and really can take you out of some scenes. Though I could see this not bothering most viewers, because the actors do such a great job portraying the people their playing that it would be hard to imagine anyone else in their roles.Steven Spielberg accomplished his goal of making a holocaust film that would not only be as close to the actual events as physically possible, but he also made it accessible to all audiences, (but for some of the more sheltered viewers, it would be a bit much.)9.4/10","

"Samiam3","15 May 2010","Oskar Schindler was a German Entrepreneur who came to Poland during the Nazi occupation to start a new business. He wanted to hire Jewish labor because they were cheaper than Polish. For a while, a good number of Jews went to work in Schinder's factories, making pots and pans for the German economy. Eventually they were rounded up by Nazi Comander Amon Goeth and put in the concentration camps. Those who were not fit to do back- breaking slave labor were put in the gas chamber. Oscar Schinder, who was in fact a Nazi supporter, slowly became empathetic after watching the cruelty to these harmless people. Using all the money he made from the business, he purchased 1,100 Jews from the Nazis, and put them back to work in his factory, under good conditions until the war was over. Not long after the war ended, Amon Goeth was executed for his crimes against humanity, and Schindler unfortunately never ran a successful business again, but today the descendants of the Jews he saved number, tens of thousands.He has become a fairly controversial figure, but I personally think that Oskar Schindler was great hero of the 20th Century, and this is one of the greatest American films of all time; absolutely heartbreaking, cinematically epic, and flawlessly acted. Many thanks to both Schindler and Spielberg.","

"Kirpianuscus","21 December 2015","maybe, not the best movie about Shoah. but the most useful. because it reminds the small details who are bricks of normality. and it does that in a wise manner. far to be one of fans of film, it seems be a real high good job. but it presents , in beautiful manner, a side of tragedy. a not large part of a phenomenon who shows its fruits but not its deep roots. a duty of Spielberg to his people, a remarkable photography and a touching story, it is a must see not for the story, artistic virtues, memorable scenes, splendid performances but for not ignore the evil. because it is not a film about Jews or a courageous man who saves innocent people , not about war but about the science to be yourself in dark periods. a film who must see. for reflection. for not ignore. the past. the vulnerability of society face to evil.","

"freemantle_uk","13 March 2008","Schindler's List is my favourite film of all time. The film is based on the novel Schindler's Ark, which itself was based on the life of Oscar Schindler who saved over 1,000 Jews during the Holocaust. Oscar Schindler was played by Liam Neeson, and his performance was excellent. The shows that Schindler himself was faulted character himself, he was a member of the Nazi, he was a war-profiteer, a womaniser and bribed officials. He did however have a sense of humanity and could not allow innocent people die. He uses his influence and money to save them and has to battle Nazi officials to do this. Ralph Fiennes was also performed brilliantly as Amon Goth, a senior Nazi who was sent to help organisation the Final Solution. Goth was portrayed a Sadistic murderer who enjoyed randomly killing Jews and having sexual affairs. It was also shown that Schindler had to work with Goth to save as many Jews as he did.As well as the acting, the black and white filming added to the atmosphere of the film. It gave the film a sense of beauty and also gives the viewer the feeling of being there. The film also shows how the horrible the Holocaust was and showed some of the things people had to do to stay alive. But it also shows the faith of many of Jews and strengthen their resolve against the Nazis.I find the Holocaust interesting on a Historical, Psychological and Sociological viewpoint because it shows mankind at its worst. It was the worst atrocity in the 20th Century and unfortunately Genocides still are going on.The ending was very touching for me as well. Some people have criticised it but I don't know why. I felt the level of emotion was just right, not over done or underplayed. It is the only time I ever been tearful during a film and that is why I think the ending works. I also like the use of real footage at the end of the film.The film as serves as a film lesson which is very good, especially since I am a History student.All in all, this film is a classic!","

"coverme6","4 April 2002","Steven Spielberg directs what is arguably considered one of his best films, the poignant and terribly depressing SCHINDLER'S LIST. Shot in stark black and white to display the gritty atmosphere of theconcentration camps, SCHINDLER'S LIST portrays the life of OskarSchindler, a greedy, womanizing Nazi businessman who has a change of heart after witnessing the slaughter of the Jews during the Holocaust. Playing the role of Schindler is Liam Neeson, who expresses a profound mix of feelings that his character must have endured: loyalty for his fellow Nazi comrades, and sympathy for the victims of the travesty. Quite the opposite is Ralph Finnes, who portrays the stone- cold Nazi stooge Amon Goeth. There are no feelings other than disgust and resentment towards Goeth, who callously and thoughtlessly kills every Jewish prisoner in his camps. The excessive images of carnage and gore might turn off some viewers, but they're shown to prove the horrors of the Holocaust, and the rampant, hateful image of the Nazis. Sure enough, I couldn't get the depressing, haunting scenes of death out of my head. But, thanks to Schindler, hope was restored to those poor people, proving there is hope when it looks impossible to exist.","

"george.schmidt","21 April 2003","SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993) **** Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Embeth Davidtz. Powerful interpretation of Thomas Keneally's novel about the true-life story of German factory enterepreneur Oskar Schindler (portrayed superbly by Neeson, warts and all, and nominated for Best Actor), who saved hundreds of Jews from the Nazis during WWII, by employing them in his war-profiteering enterprise. Excellent acting by the entire cast, specifically Fiennes (Best Supporting Actor nominee) as Amon Goeth, a remarkably complex portrayal of nuanced evil.Deservingly bestowed with 7 Oscars (including Best Picture), this harrowing documentary-styled monument to the travesties of the Holocaust is Steven Spielberg's (Best Director) masterpiece and is a must see.

"jzappa","5 August 2008","Steven Spielberg's versatility can no longer be a question once you have seen Schindler's List, one of the all-time quintessential American films. Where his most commercially successful films have been fantasies with enormous suspension of disbelief and elements of childlike wonder, Schindler's List is unremittingly real, not only in its story and subject matter but in its portrayal of a horrific point in history. One of the most unforgettable sequences I have ever seen in a movie is the SS clearing the Krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, does not cooperate, elderly or infirmed, or for no reason at all. The strange unpredictability of the sequence is masterful, such as the heartbreaking point during when the lone boy desperately tries to find a place to hide. Or when one SS officer plays a piano and carries on a nonchalant discussion while machine guns massacre hiding tenants. As Oskar Schindler, perhaps Liam Neeson's greatest role, watches the carnage from the hills overlooking the area, and is profoundly affected, during one of the most oft-revered employments of color technique in contemporary cinema.Oskar Schindler's story is so purely human, as opposed to what could have been a clearcut good vs. evil storyline in a film depicting the Holocaust. Schindler is a crass businessman from Czechoslovakia who takes advantage of the abundantly cheap work force of Jews to manufacture for the German military. He is a coldly opportunistic member of the Nazi Party, smothering the army with bribes as well as SS officials in charge. Funded by the military, he procures a factory for army mess kits. Not being shrewd enough to suitably run such an enterprise, he develops a connection with Itzhak Stern, played by Ben Kingsley in his best performance next to Sexy Beast, a functionary in the local Jewish Council who has contacts with the now underground Jewish business community in the Ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products for black market trade. Schindler makes the Nazis happy and takes pleasure in his wealth and status while Stern actually does the handling of the organization. When Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less, this means that the Jews themselves get nothing. Their wages go to the Reich. Schindler's Jews are allowed outside the ghetto though, and Stern fabricate documents to guarantee that as many people as possible are deemed essential by the Nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps.Schindler is not doing any of this to salvage the lives of these people. He's doing it because of the financial benefits. His realization of his advantage to save lives comes slowly as a sincere and valid human evolution and progression. It is an essential unlikely hero story, true, self-effacing without airs, and humbling. It is however current that drives the epic depiction of truly mortifying horrors. There are many scenes even aside from the Krakow ghetto scene that may perhaps create blood clots in your head. Truly the most unforgettable performance is given by Ralph Fiennes, playing SS official Gothe, a relentlessly evil character in the coldest, cruelest sense.","

"OttoVonB","12 January 2007","World War II is raging. Sleazy socialite and entrepreneur Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) arrive in Poland and create his own kitchen equipment fabric with an army contract. His competitive plan? Use Jews from the ghetto: they cost less than Poles or Germans. What begins as a profitable business venture will soon suck Schindler into a dark world of madness and genocide, as he discovers not only his true nature, but also, to his horror, the full implications of the nature of his government.Spielberg had amused and thrilled crowds with a long line of blockbusters before this (few human beings with eyes don't know of E.T., Jaws or Indiana Jones), and had mostly disappointed when trying his hand at more serious material: Color Purple was fair, and Empire of the Sun felt oddly shallow. Being as they weren't really his stories to tell in any case, these films can be excused as mere experiments to prepare Spielberg for this tale which he had held close to his heart for a long time.What amazes about the story is that, in typical Spielberg fashion, it wastes no time. Each scene has a point, a place, and is maximized, and given the film's length and the nature of its story, the result is positively harrowing. Schindler grows considerably throughout the ordeal: the first cynical and opportunistic businessman starts playing a dangerous psychological game with the commanding Nazi officers, namely Amon Goethe (Fiennes). Seldom has human evil found such a frighteningly real incarnation than Fiennes's horrific officer, whose unpredictable fits of depression or violence keep the viewer constantly unbalanced. Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish book-keeper then confidant gives the film a beautiful heart, and the overall acting is universally excellent. Spielberg never lets his actors down, but Steven Zaillian's screenplay truly is a miracle of character development.Shot in staggering Black and White, Schindler's List feels like re-living History. it is brutal, intense and heart-wrenching. Spielberg has returned to oppression and war since (in Amistad and Saving Private Ryan) but has never topped this, nor ave most great films in existence.For one of those rare times, a film is worthy of all the huge praise and hype surrounding it... and then some.","

Or laughing at parts when the natzi soldiers would point their guns at the jews and they lifted their hands surrendering. What was so funny? I was in shock on my generation's view of this disaster.Schinler's List is a classic movie. But I can't watch it.

Visually perfect.Editing 10/10Editing makes a film, it cannot be said enough. Actors and the like get the credit, but editors along with the writers and directors are the heart, spine and brain of a film and this film only furthers to reinforce the fact that actors are far from needed to meld a film into something sublime.Score: 10/10Williams provides another stellar score, which raises the question would Spielberg's films be as successful with out them? That said, Williams builds tension that spills morosely over tragedy and celebratory fatigue.Visual Effects: 8/10The shower scene aside, the visual effects are done well and kept in the century they are meant to be in and keeps the viewer planted firmly in the time period.Writing: 8/10The writing is superb, however it does have one to many touches of the Hollywood penmanship to it, which does cause the film to drift into a territory that feels a little unnatural for the artistic intentions of the piece.Production Design 9/10Superb production design, save for a few touches in the concentration camps.Costume Design 9/10Authentic and eye catching, though does fall victim to the standard nerd mistakes.Make-up/Hairstyle 9/10Several hairstyles feel off for the period and the make-up department does benefit greatly from the black and white.","

"gigan-92","5 January 2011","Surely and undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time. Steven Spielberg's greatest, no other film has depicted the suffering of the Holocaust so hauntingly vivid and realistic. Despite the horrors we all know took place, Spielberg is relentless with the graphic images we see, only furthered y the black-and-white visuals. The evil, sadistic nature of the Nazi cult is shown without refrain. What I particularly liked about this film was how it showed the degenerative effect of murder on a man's sanity, personified best by Amon Goeth, who was played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes, becomes a truly inhuman monster.This is without a doubt Liam Neeson's greatest role that he has ever played. He is debonair as Oskar Schindler, yet riddled with grief and guilt as the film goes on. Human geed becomes human compassion, as a ray of light against the black darkness of the Nazi hearts. And Ben Kingsley was just marvelous as Stern.And John Williams scored the film beautifully. There is not an easily recognizable leitmotif style he uses here. The music is used only here and there, to capture the realism but when you hear it you know only Williams could be behind such a radiant and somber score.As I said before easily the best movie of all time.","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","13 April 2008","""Schindler's List"" can best be described as something more than a movie. It is a cinematic exhibit and memorial dedicated to the heroism of Oskar Schindler and the 6 million plus Jews that died in the Holocaust. But don't cheat the film aspect either: this film is brilliantly made and intelligently put together. It is beautiful, smart, touching, haunting and inspiring.The story is in essence about how Schindler was touched somehow to use his position as a factory director to keep Jews from being exterminated in Auschwitz. The film uses a brilliant non-verbal method to offer reasons why Schindler did what he did. In addition, the film also serves as a historical telling of the events that occurred to a portion of the millions who died or experienced the Holocaust.Liam Neeson is very strong as Schindler. He doesn't seem all too warm and lovable at first, but eventually you take to him and see him become the hero he was. Ralph Fiennes gives a performance as the Nazi commander Amon Goeth that is simply chilling. Ben Kingsley as Schindler's assistant Yitzchak Stern also adds a great, simple, modest character.From the technical aspect, John Williams' score is beautiful. The theme is both tragic and hopeful and it's incredible that Yitzchak Pearlman was included in it as the solo violinist. The black and white work (the team of Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski strike again) is beautiful and thoroughly conceived.""Schindler's List"" is both educational and inspirational. Entertaining does not quite fit in the realm of an appropriate description. It is an experience.","

Even though my own family survived the war as Polish Catholics, they too still have scars to last more than a lifetime. My one problem with Steven Spielberg is that it's not graphic enough. The war was terrible and almost everybody in Poland was scarred as well. Schindler's List is a difficult film for adults to watch because it is graphic, brutal but all wars both graphic and brutal. Oskar Schindler wasn't so much hero or saint but he was a human being who did an incredible thing by saving thousands. There are others out there who did their part like Raoul Wallenberg. I have to say that if ,Holocaust survivor and Polish Jew, Roman Polanski directed this story to film, it might have been more brutal and graphic or maybe there would be more of a connection. I felt that Spielberg lacked that connection in this film.","

Spielberg depicts the plight of the Jews in the WWII Holocaust era with a frightening amount of detail, and thus ensures that we don't easily forget what they were put through. I liked the way it was shot in B&W, as Spielberg knows that most people have only seen the war in B&W (on TV and the like), which a lot of people seem to fail to realise. Also, when he does add colour, it gives the audience a lasting impression.The cast was wonderful, the three main leads being excellent in their performances (Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes) and the supporting cast were just as good. Janusz Kaminski's camerawork was brilliant. John Williams score was incredibly moving, and deserved the Oscar. The music is easily related to Jewish styles of the period. On the whole, a brilliant film, unforgettable, and a lesson to all. It shows that even the most hardened people can change.","

"Samuel-Shovel","3 August 2017","This movie is visually stunning. Just the sheer mass of extras, set design, costumes, cinematography, and everything else that went into this movie is breathtaking. Through all this, the movie definitely pulls off a war-time atmosphere, the black & white photography only adds another element to this. The acting is (mostly) great. And the story is a good one and an important one. What Schindler did deserves our recognition, respect, and reverence. I'm glad Spielberg was able to bring it to our attention.Now for the problems with this movie. First off, the length: I think this movie's 3 hour 15 minute runtime just snuck by Gandhi as the longest theatrically released movie in my viewing history. I try not to make a fuss over the length of a movie; however long the director requires to get their story across to the audience is up to them. What I do take issue with is a movie that has a 3+ hour long runtime that is completely unnecessary such as this one. This movie contains a story that doesn't need its allotted time. I think a 200 minute cut of this movie would really improve it, maybe even a straight 2 hours if you're pushing it. Too much time is taken replaying the horrors of Nazi-occupied Germany seemingly over and over again. I just want to be clear that I am not trying to diminish what happened or the emotional impact these scenes have, however when we as an audience are bombarded with scene after scene of tyrannical cruelty via the hands of the Germans, the emotional effectiveness of said scenes starts to fall under the law of diminishing returns. At a certain point, I as an audience member have no emotional energy left to invest and the effort Spielberg's putting into causing a mournful tone just becomes fruitless. With most things in life, overexposure will lead to dulling of the senses and emotional desensitization. I am aware that what is occurring on- screen is horrendous but my mind can no longer keep up with what is being presented. Sometimes less is more.My next issue relates to the treatment of the protagonists and antagonists of this movie. No, there is no excuse for what the Nazis did and defending this party or their belief system is contemptible and disturbing. But as a director making an Oscar-winning Best Picture, please do not make your characters these black and white symbols of good and evil. Not every person in the Nazi regime was 100% certifiably evil; not every person representing the good guys was a sinless angel. It is up to you as a director to show us these characters, their nuances, their grey areas, and their stories as a whole. It is up to us as an audience to take in all of this and make decisions about these stories and their characters. But when a director paints all these characters in broad strokes, labeling everyone as either entirely pure or entirely evil, he or she has taken the decision out of our hands and we as an audience are forced to consume the subject matter from the pre-destined moralistic vantage point that the director has prepared for us. That is exactly what has happened here. Spielberg hold our hand through the entirety of this movie, not leaving anything up to the audience's interpretation or judgment. In Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"", we get to see the multiple dimensions to characters from this conflict. Polanski focuses more on the character development of the Nazis and Jews and less on the abhorrent crimes that were occurring. So, when we do see some kind of appalling act taking place on the screen, it is considerably more effect and haunting. But the point is that Polanski treats all characters, whether bad or good, like human beings. And, to me at least, it is much more frightening to see people with humanlike qualities behind these egregious acts of genocide. (See ""Downfall"" for another great example.) Spielberg's Nazis act more like monsters from some other dimension, far less unsettling. Another issue I see with this movie is the character arc of our main focus, Oskar Schindler himself. At the beginning of this movie, we see a man who can be labeled as a womanizer, a drunkard, an opportunist, and someone who is self-centered and focused on personal wealth attainment. By the end of the movie we see a family man melodramatically balling his eyes out because he didn't give away enough of his wealth to save more Jews. (Did we really need that scene?) In theory this is a nice beginning and end point, however during the movie itself, we do not see exactly how this man went from being an egoist to a full-fledged humanitarian. Sure, the scenes involving the young girl with the red coat is supposed to represent a pair of epiphanies that Schindler has that alters his mindset similar to a Dickensian Scrooge. However, to me at least, these two scene do not do enough to cause me to buy this change. This movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes. We could spend a little of that time seeing Schindler's subtle changes over the course of the war. Instead we have this dramatic shift seemingly overnight that is difficult to swallow for me as an audience member. The character development just comes across as half-baked.Despite all the gripes I have with this film, I still think Spielberg made a fine movie here. He told a beautiful story competently and with a few scenes that left me awe-struck. While the length of this film is a bit overwhelming, it is still something that I think everyone should see at least once, a very important piece of film history.","

"rhinocerosfive-1","19 November 2007","Perhaps I should be shot, but I think four minutes of ""Springtime for Hitler"" is a more ingenious and powerful argument against anti-Semitism than four hours of ""Shoah.""Many Jews attribute the resilience of their culture to a capacity for laughter in the face of catastrophe. As Saul Bellow said, ""Oppressed people tend to be witty."" Pogroms didn't start with Hitler; by the time the Spanish Inquisition burned a hundred thousand Jews, the story of Jewish oppression already could fill many volumes. Many peoples once multitudinous have perished from the earth: there are no Carthaginians left. There are no more Thracians to speak of. The Celts live only in musical traditions and some old literature, having been subsumed by their conquerors. Their gods are dead, and their languages, or nearly so. But the Jews thrive on. Something kept hope alive under Stalin, under Isabella, under the Caesars. A sense of humor is a great virtue, not to be undervalued.But in order to make sure I appreciate the horror of the events portrayed, this movie cheats me of a glimpse at real life. The situations don't live as they might, because all the time I'm being flogged with message. There is no even partially redeemable Nazi in this movie, and Schindler's own late-stage change of heart is presented with such suddenness that the movie veers into melodrama. And even melodrama need not be propaganda; Minnelli and Ray always left us with choices. But ""Schindler"" must be classified as propaganda because it lacks the truth of even gallows humor, which by many reports existed in great abundance in the ghettos and even in the death camps.The films of Bunuel and Altman are often political but rarely propagandist. The films of Michael Bay and Marcus Nispel are always propagandist and not always political, though they are of course always bad. So propaganda need not be political, and politics need not be propaganda. This shouldn't need saying, but in the modern age of American politics, it's worth remembering. I wish Steven Spielberg remembered it. One can define propaganda objectively as a sort of forced perspective, a narrow range of potential reactions for the viewer. Propaganda is the use of art to persuade. It turns art into an expository essay. Propaganda is therefore by definition a limited form, limited by its very agenda. The tools of propaganda become less necessary the more inherently obvious the subject matter; the mass extermination of a people would seem to me to fit this category. So I think the style of this movie is unfortunately maudlin, an overkill on the negative. I am not heartless; I hate hate as much as anybody, and I celebrate Jews and all humans as valuable and not for burning. But is there no other way to express a political point than to make me cry for three hours? The fact is that film as a medium lends itself to propaganda. There is a decision made about every angle; literally, the perspective is chosen for the viewer. This is not the case with other arts, with musical performance, acting, writing, sculpture; but the more visual the medium, the greater its tendency to make statements and the less its potential for ambiguity. It takes a lot of skill to manage a visual art form into something with real depth, into a question rather than an answer.You can make propaganda about love, like ""Love Story"" or ""English Patient""; you can make propaganda out of character, like ""Patton"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia."" The easiest and most common sorts of propaganda are flag-waving and hate-mongering - what's found in state of the union addresses and election campaign ads. At its best, propaganda can remind us of our values, of our responsibilities, of our mythologies and potentials; and so it can be a great good. At its worst, propaganda may contain any of the faults of any medium - it may be bland, dull, predictable. When it is these things, it is not very persuasive, and so it fails at its main intent.In this light, ""Schindler's List"" is maybe the second-best type of propaganda. It has real emotion, a compelling story, myriad technical virtues; it leaves me with no choice but to agree with it, but of course I agree with it already insofar as genocide is not a force for good. The movie moves me to an extent. But it lacks comedy, the propagandist's most effective tool; and so when it pretends to explore a range of humanity, it tells a half-truth. Liam Neeson plays an excellent cad, and Ralph Fiennes' raptor beak was never used to more terrifying effect. (It is among the many faults of the ""Harry Potter"" movies that they cut off his nose.) But I prefer ""The Pianist"" as a portrait of Nazi-occupied Poland. Aside from possessing greater artistic powers than Spielberg, Roman Polanski has an immensely deeper capacity for human truth. He does not preach, and he is not strident, and he is not sentimental. And he allows Adrien Brody to make me laugh occasionally, not as often as he makes me cry but sometimes. Shakespeare's trick of contrasting tragedy with comedy is not simply effective storytelling; it is a view to a more realized universe. ""Jaws"" has it. ""E.T."" has it. But Spielberg apparently felt that to be funny about the Holocaust would be in bad taste. As far as propagandist filmmakers go, I'll take Charlie Chaplin or Paul Verhoeven. They are at least funny; the pill of ""Great Dictator"" or ""Starship Troopers"" goes down more easily, more persuasively, therefore more effectively, than the pill of ""Schindler"" or ""Private Ryan.""","

"gcd70","28 December 2007","I think I can safely say that Steven Spielberg is without a doubt the most talented film director of all time. Given any subject matter to cover, or any genre in which to film, he is able to produce movies of unsurpassed brilliance. Whether it be science-fiction, adventure, action, comedy or drama, his genius prevails every time, as he manages to ""entertain"" in each of these fields.""Schindler's List"" may or may not be his best ever work, but it most certainly is his most important. The story of Oskar Schindler, member of the Nazi Party, womaniser and business entrepreneur, is an amazing tale of how the Lord God has provided for his people Israel. Schindler saved over one thousand Jews from the atrocities of Nazi death camps and so ensured that generations would continue until time's end.Spielberg's perception and new found maturity shines as he presents us with a beautifully judged, understated work. He never allows the horrible violence to become gratuitous, and his decision to film in black and white again shows his marvellous insight. Spielberg knew that he would be mistaken to lend colour to such a dark period in history.Backing Spielberg up of course were some fine cast and crew members too, and the seven Academy Awards that ""Schindler"" won is indicative of its' very professional production values. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski uses the camera to full effect, bringing us some stunning pictures. Michael Kahn's film editing is very efficient and John Williams again scores the perfect music. Spielberg was also very grateful to Steven Zaillian, saying that his adapted screenplay (from Thomas Keneally's novel ""Schindler's Ark"") was beautifully understated and restrained.The cast round off the whole show with strong performances. The ever enjoyable Ben Kingsley plays a major role as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern, and does so very well, but not as well as the brilliant Ralph Fiennes, whose portrayal of twisted and sadistic Commandant Amon Goeth is outstanding, and must have narrowly missed out on an Academy Award. Of course we shouldn't forget lead player Liam Neeson, whose more than convincing performance was well worthy of the Oscar nomination it received.""Schindler's List"" is a numbing and all too disturbing film that conscientious movie-goers must no miss! After deservedly receiving both the best picture and best director Oscars for the first time, Steven Spielberg pleaded with all educators world wide to teach these horrors of the Jewish holocaust in our schools so that we would never forget.I have said before that Spielberg will probably never eclipse ""E.T."" for sheer wonderment, and the same must be said about ""Schindler's List"" for the fact of its sheer magnitude. ""Schindler"" is Steven Spielberg's crowning glory. It has given him the recognition that was long overdue him, and has also established him as perhaps the greatest film maker of all time. Congratulations Steven, and thank you!Wednesday, March 23, 1994 - Balwyn Cinema""Schindler's List"" is even better on a return viewing. One is able to acquire a deeper understanding of Oskar Schindler the person and his motivations. Steven Zaillian's screenplay is exquisite in both its detail and its simplicity, adapted superbly from Thomas Kenneally's novel ""Schindler's Ark"".Director Steven Spielberg handles all aspects of his film with quiet assuredness, producing a profoundly moving, shocking and revolutionary piece that is almost perfectly weighted, and deftly understated. Spielberg's labour of love is truly the work of a dedicated director.John William's score is a masterpiece of melodic orchestration, being quietly soothing. Michael Kahn's editing (Academy Award winning) is very astute, Janusz Kaminski's camera is very probing and unnerving, capturing some very memorable scenery. The costumes, Art Direction and Set Decoration departments have outdone themselves in recreating war time Europe.Acting is outstanding, starting with Liam Neeson, who is even better than I recall. His dramatically profound performance is probably the most important of his life. Neeson is truly haunting as he makes Schindler his own. Ben Kingsley is at his competent best in the role of the tentative but brilliant accountant Itszhak Stern, a perfectly weighted showing. Powerful support also comes from Embeth Davidtz and Caroline Goodall.Final word goes to Ralph Fiennes who, in the role of the sadistic, twisted Commandant Amon Goeth, is chillingly brilliant and mesmerisingly effective. A real find of the year, Fiennes deservedly won an Oscar nomination and followed this success with another strong showing as Charles Van Doren in Robert Redford's ""Quiz Show"".""Schindler's List"" clean swept the 1993 Academy Awards, and so it should have. Spielberg's most intellectually deep, affecting and historically important film is his crowning glory. A must see, though it is at times emotionally upsetting. It is thus hard to describe as fantastic, but one must! Unforgettable!Saturday, December 30, 1995 - Video","

"sandnair87","18 March 2015","In Schindler's List, we see images that we never thought we would ever see in a non-documentary film. It will kick you in the stomach and not stop until you can't take anymore. It will twist your finger and force you to open your eyes and take in things you would hope to never see in your whole life.The movie follows the story of Oskar Schindler, an entrepreneur who exploits Krakow Jews, only to later become their friend and redeemer. He keeps thousands of them in his factory and out of the camps while challenging and manipulating the venomous S.S. officer Amon Goeth with the help of his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern. During its 195 minutes runtime, Schindler undergoes a subtle transformation, from a self-indulgent exploiter of slave labor to savior with a mission and finally to a hero in hiding.Shot entirely in black and white, Schindler's List is certainly the most intense and uncompromising depiction of the Nazi horror ever to appear in a fiction film. Steven Spielberg directs this poignant drama with an incredible amount of uplifting hope, once again underlining the undeniable splendor of his craft. The detached reticence with which Spielberg captures the Nazis' savagery only adds to that effect. He does not use one trite shot, one forced tear-jerking assemblage. Tears are evoked, but honorably! Initially, the absence of color (with the exception of one haunting, recurring figure) may seem to spare us the gore. But it has the opposite effect: When a guard shoots a kneeling man in the back of the head, the black blood that oozes out is even more unsettling.Headlining the magnificent cast is the hitherto underrated Liam Neeson who inhabits Schindler with such authority that you cannot envisage any other actor do justice to this 'role of a lifetime'. Ralph Fiennes is simultaneously terrifying and fascinating as the S.S. Officer Amon Goeth. Watch him muse to his Jewish mistress ""I realize that you are not a person in the strictest sense of the word"" and you will be convinced how Fiennes was clearly robbed off his Oscar. The other key part is Schindler's Jewish accountant, played with self-effacing brilliance by Ben Kingsley, who lends the movie just the right amount of warmth.Marked by a brilliant screenplay and an attitude toward the traumatic subject matter that is both passionately felt and impressively restrained, this is the film to win over Spielberg skeptics.","

"dalton2","6 August 1998","Undoubtedly, this is a masterpiece, one of the most recent ones created in cinema history. Can a movie about the holocaust be beautiful? Of course it can, and here we have an example. We have more than three hours of poetry about the human nature, about love, about hate, about madness, about egoism, about altruism, all of them mixed to produce the human being as what it really is. It's a film that cleans our soul, makes us feel like humans, and makes us understand a little bit better the aim of the Human Race. John Williams gave the most beautiful sound-track he ever created to set the emotional background this film needed.","

"QStrum","14 April 2000","Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited off of slave labor.  The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men.  He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business.  But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered.  That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer).  At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't. This film is a must see by me.  I give the film an ""A+"" (wishing I could give it a higher grade than that) and a 10 out of 10...","

"tomgillespie2002","6 April 2014","Schindler's List is a film that will no doubt forever grace the endless 'Best Movies' lists trumped up by various organisations and movie magazines. It's serious subject matter, black-and-white photography, rousing score and 'directed by Steven Spielberg' tag has cemented it's status as one of the best American movies of all time. But the more hardened movie-goer will more than likely pick holes in it, and tell you that this in fact not even Spielberg's greatest achievement. Which is why, 21 years after it's release, I decided to revisit Schindler's List, and although I would agree that Spielberg has made better (he did make Jaws (1975) after all), this is still a masterful work, a wonderfully mature step-up for the film-maker who had, up to 1993, leaned towards the visual spectacle of David Lean and Howard Hawks.The Holocaust is now very much a roll-your-eyes focus for a film-maker, easily passed off as a desperate plea for awards and serious recognition, and the Oscar are routinely stacked with movies portraying this appalling historical event. But Spielberg's movie was the first one brave enough to show it for what it was - a sickening, bloody event that humiliated its victims and where the life of a Jew was worth less than the work the Nazi's could squeeze out of them before they were routinely disposed of. Documentaries such as Night and Fog (1955) and Shoah (1985) hit hard, much more so than in this movie, but Schindler's List feels like a documentary come to life, with Janusz Kaminski's cinematography giving the movie a sense of timelessness.Liam Neeson is Oskar Schindler, a Czechoslovakian opportunist looking to use cheap Jewish labour during World War II to make him enough money to help him retire a very wealthy man. He employs Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kinsley) to hire his workers and run his factory for him, at first making kitchen utensils to be used in the war. After witnessing the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto under the direction of SS- Untersturmfuhrer Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), in which many Jews are massacred, Schindler is profoundly affected. He begins to lavish gifts and bribes upon Goeth in order to protect his workers from being murdered, but as the Germans begin to lose the war, Goeth receives the orders to move the Jews from his camp onto Auschwitz.Made the same year as his CGI blockbuster Jurassic Park, Schindler's List showed an unseen maturity in Spielberg's work. He had made 'serious' films before, but they were always in the style of classic Hollywood; grand, sweeping epics that were generally homages to better directors. Here, Spielberg is invisible, his hand nowhere to be seen until one of the final scenes. This was film-making closer to Italian neo-realism, with hand-held cameras, bleak cinematography, and a glorious lack of sentimentality. Rather than make you weep into a tissue, he has you looking away from the screen in utter shock. Hundreds of naked Jews are humiliated as decisions are made on their ability to work and Goeth coldly shoots workers with a rifle from his balcony before breakfast. In one of its most famous scenes, a group of women are led into a shower room that may just be a gas chamber. It's one of the most terrifying sequences in recent memory.Spielberg wisely chose relatively unknown actors to fill the roles. Neeson, now inexplicably an action star, brings a complexity to Schindler as he changes between smug womaniser and Nazi suck-up to a man capable of great kindness and selflessness, and the film isn't afraid to show the darker side of his character. Kingsley, who was known for his Oscar-winning role in Gandhi (1982), is Schindler's consciousness, a constant reminder of the atrocities that were being committed outside of Schindler's comfortable bubble. As Amon Goeth, one of cinema's most memorable villains, Ralph Fiennes steals the film. He is a hypocritical, loathsome psychopath, embodying the sense of self-righteousness of the Nazi power trip. He despises the Jews, and preaches about their extermination, yet falls in love with his servant Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), only to beat her in his disgust.Although there are better films out there that focus on World War II or the Holocaust, it is of no surprise that this is still one of Spielberg's most revered films. It is a brave, accomplished film that gives you a sense that this was the film the director was always meant to make. However, he seems unable to resist stamping his recognisable dose of sentimentality at the climax, as Schindler breaks down in front of his workers wishing he did that little bit more. It's an unnecessarily slushy scene, a piece of director self-indulgence in what is damn near a perfect film, that, if anything, lessens the brutal impact of what came before. But this is a staunch reminder of the atrocities that humanity is capable of, and, as all great movies do, feels incredibly short at over three hours.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","

"DanB-4","20 September 1999","I almost dare not ""review"" or ""comment"" on this film. However, I  will, because this is a film everyone should see. It is dramatic, emotional and noble, and handles the most difficult subject of the 20th century without giving a sermon.Schindler's List is clearly Speilberg's best - the best he will ever do - and is one the great films of all time. It is an experience, not just a movie. Those who hate it or dislike it, I challenge you to watch it again and question your feelings. Did it disturb you? Did it frighten you? I think that it is near impossible to dislike this movie - only to be bothered by it.The fact is that this film deals in truth. It graphically portrays a dark, dark chapter in human history, and provides deep insight into the role hatred played in WWII. This is a movie that will make you question the world we live in and make you feel sorry to be a part of the species that let this happen.Note also, that there is no great sermon on why genocide is wrong or why the Nazis must be stopped. Schindler's heart is opened by what he sees and experiences - no-one needs to tell him that killing is wrong.Pretty bleak, but pretty accurate. But under the thematic elements is a great film. Extraordinary acting, especially Ralph Fiennes as the psychotic Amon Goeth. Janusz Kaminky's cinematography is amongst the best ever seen.Without spoiling, I can say that this is the singularly most horrifying movie I have ever seen. It disturbed me for days. I recommend this movie to everyone. It will entertain you, but also educate you, but mostly, it is an important film that will make you examine your own life. As dark as it is, this is a movie of hope and survival. **** out of ****.","

"Red-Barracuda","30 March 2011","At the time of this film's release, while he was the undisputed commercial king of cinema, Steven Spielberg had never been considered a 'serious' film-maker. With the exception of The Colour Purple he was known as a director of big-budget B-pictures. Many people criticized his films for being too syrupy and child-like. With the notable exceptions of Duel and Jaws this wasn't necessarily an unfair assessment. While his vision was unerringly on the pulse of the mainstream, it rarely had any edge whatsoever. So with the release of Schindler's List, Spielberg was able to offer something pretty bleak and hard-hitting. He was also rewarded at the Academy Awards, which was another thing he craved desperately.The book by Thomas Keneally from which the film was adapted is a masterful and deeply disturbing account of true events in Nazi occupied Poland. It takes a documentary approach to events, as it is all from real accounts. It was, therefore, the sort of novel that had to be treated with the utmost respect if it was to be translated to the screen with any success. It has to be said that Spielberg was largely very successful in this challenge, and his film remains a powerful telling of this most harrowing, if ultimately uplifting, of tales. He wisely decided to film it in stark black and white which lends an immediate bleakness to proceedings and recalls old footage from the Second World War. When he does decide to inject a bit of colour, as in the little girl in the red coat, it works in bringing out the appalling tragedy of this little girl's life even more – it doesn't seem gimmicky. Another major plus for the film is in the performances. Liam Neeson has the right blend of charisma and humanity as Oskar Schindler but best of all is Ralph Fiennes as the camp commandant Amon Goeth; he played this character with extreme skill and brought to the screen a strangely complex presence. I certainly wouldn't go as far as to say Fiennes's Goeth was sympathetic – he was vile – but his underlying impulses and insecurities had interesting depth to say the least.On the whole Spielberg handles things very well here. His trademark schmaltz is thankfully absent, and he does not hold back when he needs to ramp things up and show atrocities. Quite often Schindler's List is very unpleasant, and the director wisely doesn't sugar-coat things. The only place where he breaks is in Schindler's closing speech at the factory. This moment was melodramatic and totally unnecessary. The events depicted up to that point had been faithfully told from a historical point-of-view and they did not need that invented moment of emotional manipulation; what had gone before spoke for itself. This minor slip-up aside, Schindler's List did prove that Spielberg was capable to making serious films when he put his mind to it.","

"pyrocitor","17 October 2007","Films detailing the tragic events of the Holocaust more often than not tend to descend into ill-advised and horrifyingly clichéd anti-war lectures, so the notion of Steven Spielberg, debatably the founding father of the blockbuster, helming a WW2 epic may not always have been an ideal prospect, for fear that the gritty realism of the period may have been lost beneath a shiny veneer of Hollywood gloss. Needless to say, such doubts are near instantly dispelled upon viewing Schindler's List, which, while refusing to shy away from the horrific realism of the period, manages to extract moments of genuine glimmering hope out of the darkness, managing to stand out as both one of the most emotionally draining yet exhilarating and uplifting films of its kind. Dispelling all potential skepticism, Spielberg proves himself entirely the right man for the job, and Schindler's List is arguably one of his very strongest and most effective films to date. The film sears itself into the viewer's memory, with many haunting images proving inescapable, from the jarring sound of sporadic Nazi gunshots to the despairing moan of thousands of Jews crowded into a ghetto. Spielberg's effortless manipulation of the audience's emotions is laudable indeed, as is his masterful pacing between the atrocities of war and the small moments of comfort which prevent the film from descending into complete darkness. Complimented by a typically moving and beautiful musical score by John Williams, the film perfectly counterbalances despair with hope, creating a truly compelling and moving portrait of one of humanity's darker hours. The historical accuracy of the film is similarly laudable - the immaculate period costumes and expansive set design are pitch perfect, and all beautifully rendered in pristine black and white cinematography, a refreshing diversion from the colour saturated contemporary film industry. And while the film's hefty three and a quarter hour running time may be a source of complaint, it serves only to further immerse the audience within the context and period, allowing the emotional drama to resonate all the more. It would seem Spielberg was not content to simply provide audiences with a film, and instead settles for an experience - an emotional epic with an uncanny ability to draw an audience in, capture their sympathies and churn them out with a tear in their eye yet a smile on their face in a nearly peerless fashion. And despite the film's undeniable occasional forays into melodrama and cliché (Schindler's breakdown near the end, tearfully declaring that he could have saved more is a bit much...) it is difficult to turn one's nose up at so captivating and heartfelt a film as this. Liam Neeson gives a career defining performance as the benevolent Oskar Schindler, and his gentle charisma and subtle intensity perfectly compliment the many facets (womaniser, enterpriser and saviour of thousands of innocent lives) of such a monumental role. Ben Kingsley is similarly impressive as Itzhak Stern, the Jewish manager of Schindler's factory. In a role which would normally entail typical Hollywood grandstanding, Kingsley instead embraces the realism of the character with subtly churning emotions, and his performance is all the more masterfully crafted as consequence. However, despite the stellar work of the main two stars, both pale in comparison with the magnetic Ralph Fiennes, effortlessly stealing the show as impassive yet impulsively murderous Nazi official Amon Goeth. Fiennes' chilling intensity is truly a spectacle to behold, and it is nearly worth seeing the film just for his performance - one of the most haunting, but ultimately human antagonistic faces ever associated with the Holocaust. Caroline Goodall gives a strong performance as Schindler's neglected wife, and Embeth Davidtz is genuinely moving as Helen Hirsch, a Jewish slave working who attracts the fancy of the monstrous Goeth. Throughout the years, Schindler's List has been widely celebrated as one of the most powerful, draining yet uplifting films in recent memory, and upon viewing it, this status is difficult to contend. While the film may toe the line of melodrama at times, and the running time may be enough to dispel some potential viewers, the blistering emotional clout and historical poignancy make Spielberg's labour of love easily worth watching for anyone willing to undergo the admittably difficult and draining watch. Out of all the second world war films out there, Schindler's List stands out as debatably the most engrossing and ultimately uplifting of the lot, proving that in the midst of darkness and despair, genuine human emotion can still be celebrated. -10/10","

"851222","17 January 2015","Greetings from Lithuania.To call ""Schindler's List"" a great movie would be a huge underestimating. This is simply one of the best motion pictures of all time. I know it sounds banal but truth is simple - ""Schindler's List"" is a masterpiece. No matter what are your believes, not matter what is your life experience or anything else - this is a monumental movie experience. Probably no other movie in my life grabbed my so hard, delivered me to the place and made me experience events so purely as ""Schindler's List"" did. This is a movie making at it's very best. Everything in this movie works on highest level for some simple reasons - to get the knowledge and to learn. Learn from our past, learn from our unforgivable mistakes and to witness a descent humanity in the most ruthless places of our times. I won't going to start to admire this movie craftsmanship. It's brilliant. Everything here combines to a one excruciating masterpiece. One who will experience ""Schindler's List"" won't going to ever forget it. This is a timeless masterpiece. And one of the most sticking things that ever haunted me was that this picture was created in Hollywoood, by Steven Spielberg who at the time was mostly known for mainstream blockbuster experiences. How could they come up with such an idea and most important how could they created this kind of a movie, which doesn't represent popular teams and tones is still beyond me. I guess, true art find it's way, and for this motion picture Steven Spielberg will be remembered forever.Overall, if you haven't experienced ""Schindler's List"" by now, do your self a favor and witness this masterpiece ASAP. I'm writing this review from a country which is neighboring country to Poland. I'm so grateful to a simple luck that i wasn't born and wasn't there when these unthinkable events have happened. And my honest sympathy for those whom it has ever affected.","

"Sirus_the_Virus","15 February 2010","Some people believe that Adolf Hitler was possessed by the devil. Well, that may sound ridiculous to some but actually not to me. There is no way someone could be so evil. There have been a couple of films to show how sick he was. One of them was The Great escape. another was the revenge fantasy Inglourious Basterds. Both terrific films. One film that I will never forget(those two aren't forgettable)is Schindler's list, which won best picture in 1993. Schindler's list is probably one of the best films i've ever seen. It has such a great story. It's at times very disturbing. Oskar Schinlder was a great guy. Excluding the fact that he was a part of the Nazi party. But he risked his life for the Jews, with knowing that he'd get in trouble. Schindler's list is a devastating film.Steven Spielberg has been making classic films for many, many years. He is a genius. I have only seen one of his films that i've disliked. Artificial intelligence. My favorite of his is Raiders of the lost ark. Then Schindler's list. The film may be three hours long. Sometimes when it's a three hour film I can't bear it anymore. Such as Transformers 2. But if it's Lord of the rings, or Gandhi, or Schindler's list, there is no way that I will call the length a flaw.Liam Neeson plays a great guy named Oskar Schindler, a business man in the Nazi party. He soon opens up a factory in Poland. When he realizes what the Nazi's are doing to the Jews, Oskar and his friend(the always great Ben Kingsley)hire Jews to work in the factory to keep them out of concentrations camps.Ralph Feinnes stars as a sadistic Nazi who really just kills anyone. For instance there is a scene when there is a Jew walking through the street and he shoots her. Embeth Davidz stars as his slave. Nazis were sadistic, power hungry, fame seeking bastards. Every time I watch Inglourious Basterds, I think, if only this were based on the truth. If only Hitler was shot to death inside a movie theater. But Schindler's list is based on a true story. Oskar Schindler was a great man. He saved the lives of about 1100 Jews. This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I think. This is a brutal film. And, unlike many films, it actually nearly got a tear out of me. That rarely happens. And when it does, it's either because the film is truly spectacular or because it's just a sad film. Well, in the Schindler's list case, it could really go either way.Schindler's list: A","

"Steffi_P","1 January 2012","One of the benefits of our modern day cinema (and by modern, I mean last forty-odd years) is that movies can be made with complete frankness. The more difficult segments of history can be recreated with some accuracy. Schindler's List deals with subject matter so sensitive, and tells one of the most important stories of the entire century, that the makers absolutely have to get it right, on every level. Thankfully, they did.Screenwriter Steve Zaillian has taken on the difficult task of adapting a work of non-fiction. Much of the picture is simply a series of vignettes, most not strictly necessary to the plot, the sort of material that has been cut for reasons of space in a thousand lesser pictures. But they contribute to an overall tone – each has its own meaning, and to cut one would make for a poorer film. Although it of course follows real events as closely as possible, great care is taken with the rate at which we are exposed to the magnitude of horror. The first two deaths we see – the one-armed man and the civil engineer – are painfully shocking. But by the time we get to the ransacking of the ghetto we are desensitised to the killing, immersed in this world where the ending of life is a casual act. Lines of dialogue which at first seem trivial gain resonance later on. When meeting with the black marketers Schindler tells them ""Nice things cost money"". Eventually he will be buying human lives.In evaluations of Schindler's List, so often the importance of the man who portrayed the title role is forgotten. Liam Neeson's performance perhaps doesn't stand out too much because it is very low-key, and the character is almost passive for all his significance. But this makes Neeson's work all the more impressive. He puts all of Schindler's emotion, all his thought, into this restrained façade. Schindler was a man who essentially spent the whole war keeping up a pretence, albeit for altruistic purposes, that he was a good party member and practical businessman, and Neeson handles this contradiction flawlessly. When he allows the floodgates to open in his final scene, the effect is devastating.Steven Spielberg famously offered this project to a number of directors before deciding to take on the job himself. It could have been disastrous – his direction is appalling in The Color Purple, his first real drama – but in the intervening years he had improved considerably. For Schindler's List he takes an incredibly indirect approach, his camera often separated from the action or just focusing briefly on hands and objects, as if the material is somehow distant and difficult to fully engage with. Despite this distancing effect, Spielberg proves himself a master at picking out the important detail in each shot. To give one example, when we first see Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, he is right at the back of a room with a dozen or so people in, but Spielberg has arranged everyone into diagonals so that our eyes are drawn straight to Kingsley. Spielberg's utter simplicity and lack of camera trickery are commendable. His careful pacing of scenes makes those all-important lines stand out, and emphasises the life in the people.And this – the life – is essentially what Schindler's List is about. I didn't really intend to comment on the issues in the picture because I wanted to discuss it mainly as an example of perfection in filmmaking. But like any movie Schindler's List is not without its detractors, and sometimes people do miss the point. Spielberg has been accused of sugar-coating the holocaust, of taking this horrible event in history and making an uplifting story out of it. Of course, the Nazis did many more terrible things which the movie does not show, and it does end upon a note of hope. But the truth is, Schindler's List is not the story of the holocaust. It is the story of Oskar Schindler, a man who saved lives. The tragedies that occurred in Europe are the backdrop to this story, and the realities that Spielberg offers us a modest window onto are nonetheless graphic enough to give it meaning. This is not primarily a picture about the evil that went on, it is about the good that existed in spite of that evil. And if ever there was something worth making a motion picture about, it is this.","

"emasterslake","30 June 2006","I didn't see this movie till recent. But I've been told it's violent and very well received back in 1993. I'm 17 so it was OK for me to see a movie like this.Anyways Schindler's List takes place during WW2. And those who attended history class would know that Adolf Hitler had total control in most parts of Europe and banned all Jewish activity and removed all the Jewish from their homelands. It was the grimmer moment in the entire Jewish history.A man named Oscar Schindler was a business man and a Nazi. Only he was different from other Nazis. He provides the Jews work at his company only if they have working experience. Schindler in secretly does not kill or torture any Jews. He finds the whole thing wrong in a way. But he doesn't adment it because he's might receive serious consciences if he were to say he likes Jews.He makes sure his Jews aren't killed or sent to the more lethal concentration camps by making a list of hundreds of Jews that he bought with his own money. With that list he could be able to grant their freedom by the time the war is over.This movie is very well made. Spielberg did a great job in recreating this time period. I can see why it was given an Oscar during the 1993 Accadmy Awards. It's also interesting that 3/4s of the movie is shot in Black and White.It's strongly recommended for any Spielberg collection. Just know this movie isn't for everyone. It has swearing, violence, and some strong nudity. It's not for kids so I'd recommend it for ages 16 and up or at least someone mature enough to see a violent movie.It might offend certain Jews or those who are offended by Nazis as well.","

But now, I have seen it and am so deeply impressed that I cannot express my utmost gratitude well. Spielberg is a genius here, as he always is. He made a strikingly great work, so deep and so tragic. Its black and white scheme made it even better and deeper. All who played there are truly tremendous. Neeson, Fiennes, Kingsley - just even them three made it so brilliant. This is a movie that must be seen and taught at schools as a great reminder of utter horrors of Holocaust. I am deeply moved to tears, especially by the final scene which is so good, so tender, so gentle and so Powerful. Need I say more? This is a masterpiece","

"aidosh94","18 June 2007","Steven Spielberg makes one of (if not the one) his greatest movies of all time. Liam Neeson gives a great performance as Schindler and the whole film is just powerful, amazing and sad but it doesn't matter because the movie is so good. Ralph Fiennes makes an even better performance as Goeth, a man who made everyone stare into the screen with anger and sadness and that is just what a movie is supposed to do-make you feel sad, happy, angry or effect you in some way. I read that someone thought it was overrated and bad, but I think it's a classic and it'll never go away. So if you want to see one of the greatest historical films ever made, then go see Schindler's List.EDIT: I wrote this when I was 12 or 13, and I'm so sorry about my AWFUL English... Ah, well just have that in mind when you read this. =)","

"SumanShakya","31 January 2016","Actually I had watched this film 13-14 years ago. But that time I got pretty distracted and couldn't grasp much of the film. After watching it again, I must say it's a remarkable film which comes once in a while. Based on the true events of the holocaust, the film is like a well written book which can serve as a quality time to anyone striving for a brilliant work of art.Well, many nice films have been made on Jews concentration camps like ""Life Is Beautiful,"" ""The Pianist,"" or the most recent ""The Boys on Striped Pyjamas."" Indeed all the movies were brilliant, but they saw holocaust through individual character. But ""Schindler's List"" gives a holistic account of the history for which the film stretches for over 3 hours and uses monochromatic colors to give the periodic feel. Despite the over-length, every scene of the film remains compulsively watchable till the end credits. Every scene presents a cinematic excellence in depicting the story of a greedy industrialist who saves over 1100 Jews from the concentration camps. His uplift of the spirit from greed to human compassion, seeing the atrocities of Nazis, is brilliantly realized. The bloodshed in the film starts with a single execution which slowly shifts to mass killings during the liquidation of ghettos showing the brutality done to humankind, which just leaves you horrified. The grit and the depressing environment the film creates is pretty touching and many moments of the film raises the feelings of humanity for which the film becomes a well felt heart touching saga. For focusing the story. the film keeps a low profile with much unknown cast and avoids sentimentality and gloss till the very end. Overall, the film remains a landmark for the ages to come; and it deserves to be archived as one of the immortal film makings of all time.Rating: 4 stars out of 4","

"jackasstrange","28 November 2013","So here we go in my 80th review, in this November 28th 2013, coincidentally the day of an American Holiday Thanksgiving Day. Nothing better in fact than watch a very good film in that special date for those who celebrate it, and for sure, Schindler's List is the perfect film. It's very cliché to say that, because as we all know it is a very popular and acclaimed film from both critics and audiences, and is widely regarded as one of The Greatest of All Times, but even with these accolades, i think i need to say it's a great film, because it has everything you can seek in a film. It's sad, it shows how the war can affect otherwise normal people as Göth_masterfully interpreted by Ralph Fiennes_ in wicked and psycho assassins, which believed so much in the Nazism that he turned into a disturbed man.But unlike Schindler himself says in the film's beginning, a war also can turn a 'bad' person in a 'good' one, perhaps. Schindler was a completely egocentric person, but after the vision of the girl in red which contrasts with the black and white scenario. She clearly has a specific allegoric sense, and so had the candles. Then he starts to help the Jews, and he really did everything that he could do to help them, until the war's end. And despite my despise for these conventional 'black and white' characters, this film works very well exploring these, i must say, one-dimensional characters. With an exception to Göth,of course, because he had various faces in the film, though all due to his madness.I don't need to say that the cinematography and art design were fantastic in this film. It Principal photography took place in Kraków, Poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it like a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. I highly recommend this film, if you haven't already watched it. 9.4/10","

"Bobson10","23 January 2013","""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.""'Schindler's list is about the true story of Czech born Oskar Schindler, a businessman who tried to make his fortune during the Second World War by exploiting cheap Jewish labour, but ended up penniless having saved over 1000 Polish Jews from almost certain death during the holocaust.'Steven Spielberg's best film, by far! His camera work in the film is unique.40% of this film is used with a hand-held camera. There were no steadicams or crane shots used. His efforts were to make it look more like a documentary and his effects were great! The black and white effect used only adds to the depression. The editing of colour throughout is very powerful, examples include the candles burning, the girl in the red coat and the ending sequence.The acting presented is amazing. Liam Neeson brings an Academy Award worthy performance to the screen. His transition from a greedy business man to humanitarian is marvellous. Ralph Fiennes is also great in the film. He plays Amon Goeth, an SS officer who is sadistic and psychopathic, frequently murdering his prisoners for fun. A performance not many can accomplish. Ben Kingsley is amazing portraying Itzhak Stern. He makes my favourite scene. As Stern figures out that Schindler is using his own money to rescue Jews, his face expression says it all. Very emotional.The Score in this film is magic. In my opinion, it's the music that brings out the most of the emotion in the film. John Williams is brilliant!Schindler's List will not only go down as the best holocaust film ever made but one of the best films in the history of cinema.","

What's really good about this movie is the acting. Liam Neeson proves that he can act and he should have won a Oscar for his performance as Oskar Schindler. Ralph Fiennes also gives a great performance and should have won a Oscar for his performance as Amon Goeth but since the academy doesn't give awards to actors that play as bad people is dumb. What I really liked about this movie is how the whole movie is shot in black and white it just makes the movie even better. While your watching this movie you feel really emotional inside. Everything about this movie is just perfect from the acting, cinematography, musical score, writing, and directing. This movie is intense, emotional, and apiece of art.

"Spleen","7 September 1999","Steven Spielberg was wrong about the subject matter of his own film.  It's no more `about' the holocaust than it's `about' Eastern Europe.  It's about Oscar Schindler.  More to the point: it's about an amoral small-time capitalist with neither more nor less compassion than most other people, who finds himself as surprised as anyone when cruel and unusual circumstances mould him into a hero.  It's about a man led to the path of morality as much by his belly as by his heart.  It's a study in the banality of goodness.  I don't know how many other people have used that phrase, but there's no better way of putting it.It's the job of documentaries, not fiction, to teach us about the past. `Schindler's List' is not a lesson about the what happened to European Jews under Nazi rule - at any rate, it's not a particularly good lesson.  It's fiction.  I'm not, of course, saying that it's false - I gather most of it is true.  Nor am I saying that it can't teach us a lesson of another kind. When Superman saves a thousand people we can always say, `That's all very well, but I can't leap tall buildings in a single bound; and anyway, Superman is supernaturally virtuous.'  When someone as flawed as Oscar Schindler saves a thousand people it's not so easy to make excuses.There's a good story here.  Many people do some of their best work in telling it.  I don't think that Neeson, Fiennes or Spielberg have ever performed better than they do here, and John Williams writes fine music in an understated style he hasn't used for a while.  But it's really the story that makes the movie.  Spielberg, in thinking that he's making a kind of documentary, sometimes lets the story down - every single use of colour is an intrusion, and anyone who's read the book will find that sections have been transferred flatly, with a palette knife, to the screen.  Probably this film has been praised a little more than it deserves.  Oh, well.  Excess praise will be washed away with time.One minor point: when the book was first published in Australia, it was called `Schindler's Ark'.  `Schindler's List' is the (inferior) American title.  Sadly, after the success of the film the book was called `Schindler's List' even here.  Spielberg could have called his film `Schindler's Monocle' - or anything at all - and publishers would have dutifully re-named the book.  It's a pity he didn't use his power to restore the original title.","

"lawprof","18 March 2004","It won't be very long before the last survivors of the Holocaust as well as their rescuers are dead.  Their children will, with varying degrees of passion and understanding, repeat stories long told or wonder about experiences barely hinted at.  Then that generation too will be gone and the dense record will largely interest those committed to studying history, a minority.Film can have much to say about the world that not so very long ago convulsed with the agony of a war that included among its terrors unprecedented state-directed genocide committed with, for its time,  cruelly efficient technology.  Steven Spielberg produced a masterpiece with 1993's ""Schindler's List"" and it will remain a painful, at times agonizing, recreation of a very special craziness.Winner of many awards including the Oscar for Best Picture, the cast brings to life an enigmatic and, probably, not very likable man, German small-time industrialist Oskar Schindler.  Schindler profited from the war and he was a skirt-chaser of extraordinarily ravenous tastes.  What set him apart was his rescue of some 1100 Jews from the jaws of the Nazi extermination apparatus. Compared to the tally of the murdered this seems a small number but every life is precious and Schindler did what he could.Why did he set about rescuing people destined for the gas chambers or death through individual murder or, simply, by overwork?  No one really knows including the survivors themselves.  One has been quoted as saying that everytime he asked Schindler about his motives during postwar encounters he got a different and incomplete answer.Perhaps Schindler himself never knew.  But results are more important than reasons.There have been some notable films about Nazis, concentration camps and genocide.  Some like ""Life is Beautiful"" reflect too much development of a star and seem almost obscenely clean, even with the killings.   ""The Pianist"",  a recent fine example, shows the suffering of a gifted and wounded man against a supporting backdrop of horror.In ""Schindler's List,"" the hopelessness of the victims stretches from frame to frame and the first senseless killings seamlessly lead to a growing orgy of dehumanization.  Liam Neeson is extraordinary as the German factory owner and Ralph Fiennes as the SS concentration camp commander is both repulsive and fascinating as a warped man whose violence ebbs and flows without any rational inciting events.Some dismiss Fiennes' character as one-dimensional and unreal but, in fact, any study of SS types who commanded those camps reveal the same split personalities: people who could be fine family men before setting off to work to superintend mass murder, stopping on the way to commit the occasional individual atrocity.The DVD release has been digitally enhanced and the sound is crisp. Spielberg declined to provide the usual extras found on most DVD releases, stating that his original film should speak for itself.  But augmenting the movie is a documentary where some who survived because of Schindler recount their experiences.  It must not be missed: some of these voices are already stilled-all will be soon.A very unusual item in the DVD edition is an envelope soliciting contributions to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive and to teach its lessons to young people increasingly remote from the war.  The solicitation is appropriate-I'm posting a check.Tonight was my third viewing, the first at home on DVD. An amazing, disturbing, brilliant film that will continue through the decades to be invaluable. 10/10","

"movieguy1021","16 April 2004","Eventually, I would have had to have seen Schindler's List. Not only was it a staple in modern filmmaking, but I'm also Jewish and have been taught all about the Holocaust. I like Spielberg, and I can sit through long movies (although I did watch the movie in three pieces), so I plunked this newly released DVD into my player and was treated to an adventure, the likes of which I had never seen before.Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a German during World War II. All he cares about is money, and runs a business while the height of the Nazi regime in Poland is taking place. He realizes that he can save money on hiring Jews instead of Poles to work in his factory (since the Jews would be taken from the concentration camps, they would not really require much, if any, pay). After some pleading from his wife and his desire to hold onto his accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kinglsey), Schindler decides to make a list of Jews to save from certain death to work in his factory.Quite obviously, this movie will have different effects on different people, much like the recent Passion of the Christ did. Those who had relatives who were captured by the Nazis, or knew someone, or were alive at the time, or anything of the like, would be much more affected by this film than others. I found myself horrified by many of the atrocities brutally shown, especially ones done by Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). It's amazing, how you can be so affected by gruesomeness done to characters you know nothing about.On a lesser side, I found many scenes to be unnecessary and uninteresting. They only added to the already obscenely long runtime. Also, the character of Goeth, when not brutalizing Jews, seemed to become perfectly normal and balanced. Goeth seemed duplicitous, and therefore somewhat unbelievable. Neeson was good, but Kingsley was excellent. One more thing that bothered me was the girl in the red dress. Filmed in almost all black-and-white, there's some sort of symbolism there, but there's no telling what it is.Overall, Schindler's List is an important film, and a tough one to get through, but what you'll get out of it will differ from what others will.My rating: 8/10Rated R for war violence and language.","

This is a documentary of real life events, a truly terrifying picture which chronicles The Holocaust, within the most destructive period of our time. A time that must never be repeated. Captured masterfully in black-and-white celluloid with hand-held cameras, Schindler's List follows Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who begins to feel concerned for his Jewish workforce, leading to an emotionally captivating story that evolves continuously as Steven Zaillian's beautiful screenplay culminates to one of Schindler's final heartbreaking lines: ""I could have got more out. I could have got more. I don't know. If I'd just I could have got more.""Liam Neeson showcases a raw talent as Schindler, performing skilfully throughout. Every line is delivered with absolute care and feels entirely realistic. His interactions with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) are some of the greater scenes in the film, most specifically the creation of the list. Kingsley has always proved himself an incredible supporting act. Ralph Fiennes also plays alongside Neeson as Amon Goeth, a ruthless and negligent SS captain who murders for sport. Eventually, Goeth is told that power is in fact to never kill, but pardon a man. It never truly connects with him, but continues his work with it in mind. This is one of Fiennes' greatest, most pre-eminent performances to date.The decision to shoot the film in black-and-white only catapults the 'documentary tone' that Spielberg sets out to achieve, and in doing so creates an eerie experience for viewers. There's one scene in particular that uses colour for a little girl's red coat, as she stumbles through a disturbing site of bloody murder whilst Schindler keeps a close eye. This scene essentially serves as the brutal realisation for Schindler, and becomes one of the most iconic scenes in film history. A simply breathtaking use of colour within a black-and-white picture. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski expresses his enduring adroitness with excellent execution.John Williams' haunting score captures the horrors of war as violinist Itzhak Perlman performs every single note with intricate skill. The main theme is pleasing to the ears but when paired with Spielberg's picture, it's painfully distressing, traumatic, even disturbing. 'Jewish Town' continues that same feeling, but explores Williams & Perlman's impeccable talent further. This is a fine example of the perfect film score.Verdict; It may be a tough subject and a difficult experience to bear, but Schindler's List is a film to be seen by all.Schindler's List – ★★★★ (8/10)","

"Vincentiu","26 January 2007","A very difficult film. Any definition is venturesome, any praise is strange or shallow. At final, it is not a movie or adaptation of an existence but a subtle form of catharsis. This movie is source of a special experience. And the causes are numerous:1) It is an artistic masterpiece. Light, images, acting, script and silence, nuances of tragedy and delicate suggestions are pieces of a fascinating approach. So, it is result of a deep and powerful sentiment and Spielberg is the gorgeous sculptor of its.2} The story is old and aching. The Shoah is not a Jewish or German problem or result of propaganda. The good and the evil are elements, in that crime, not of ethics or faith, education or fear, mercy or public image but seal of atrocious ambiguity. And this vagueness is fundamental part of our world. In fact,it is essence of its conscience. So, the irrational brutality of Goeth is only cliché. The bad Nazi, cruel, sarcastic and bizarre is rotten puppet of a death period. After ""The Night of the Generals"" this character type is absurd.3} Fundamental value of film is the subtle art of suggest a reality out of any description's form. Images are poor shadow of a crime without limit or reason. And this suggestion is represented by Neeson's acting; the metamorphose of an ordinary business man in a hero part of his mission.4} The interpretation of Sir Ben Kingsley is touching. His character is heard of a miracle and the tension, fear, expectation and force of gestures, the short words and the look transforms Itzhak Stern in conscience of fight for some people for who to survive is fragile dream.5} The option for monochrome image is essence of its perfect beauty. The mixture between ashes and human ash, between lead, tension and free cruelty of irrational monstrosity , plans of escape and lies gives form of a wold's fragile definition .6} It is a great masterpiece for the sensitivity of looking. The film is a remember and a decent homage for a special hero and for his strange war. But not story is important. The only virtue, the real virtue is the image of story teller's spirit reflected in each syllable of tale.","

"nickmesafilms","26 January 2012","Known to all audiences as one of the greatest movies ever made, ""Schindler's List"" is biographical drama of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand Polish-Jews during the Holocaust, and employing them in his factories. This could affect the lives of many Jews during this terrible event in history. With a 3-hour running time, a marvelous script, and a breathtaking directing duty from the legendary Steven Spielberg, ""Schindler's List"" is one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. Liam Neeson delivers his best performance as Oskar Schindler, and this guy really brings truth and charm to his character, and it lets you see that he has transformed into this iconic figure. Ralph Fiennes portrays a scene-stealing performance as SS-officer Amon Goth, with a cruel villainy to his character that is just awesome to watch on screen. Ben Kingsley, Embeth Davidtz, and Caroline Goodall round up the supporting cast, and they all create a powerful casting ensemble. Director Steven Spielberg succeeds once again, directing such a fine masterpiece, that led him to two Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture. This film may be lacking for the first couple of hours, but it does not change the fact that this movie is a sensational piece of work. Some moments make you furious, some moments make you cry, and this is the type of movie that you are going to feel bad about, but you'll still enjoy it. The art direction is sensational, the editing is superb, the cinematography is just masterful, and John Williams' score is completely breathtaking. But it's Spielberg himself that guides this movie. His directing has made a big impact on the face of cinema, and he improves once again, making one of the greatest films he has ever made. This movie is dramatic and heartbreaking, but this also a challenging and emotionally moving motion picture, and Spielberg never disappoints. ""Schindler's List"", in my review, ""an epic and heartbreaking Spielberg masterpiece"".","

"Lady_Targaryen","3 November 2005","I like Steven Spielberg's movies a lot,and this movie I can tell you it's one of my favorites and it is absolutely great. It's about the Holocaust,the second war, and a man called Oskar Schindler, who was a Nazi Czech business man who tried to make his fortune during the Second World War by exploiting cheap Jewish workers, but stays emotionally linked with his workers,using the factory as a place for the Jews hide from the Nazis. The beautiful thing about all that, is that this story is real, and Oskar Schindler saved 1.100 Jews from the Auschwitz concentration camp. The end is awesome and very touching, showing the real people and their correspondent actors.By the way, the acting of Liam Neeson Ralph Fiennes Ben Kingsley Embeth Davidtz are great! Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley really deserved an Oscar! :)","

"chrisbrown6453","17 June 2002","Schindler's List did quite well at the box office, while it guaranteed the maker his first Oscar for directing. Jane Campion edged him out for several of the year-end awards given by critics groups, but the Academy put him at the top of their ""A"" list for this effort. 1993 was quite a year for Spielberg. JURASSIC PARK went goofy worldwide, eclipsing yet another Spielberg megabuck effort, E.T. Schindler's List may never quite reach the same box-office stratosphere, but Spielberg can certainly be most pleased and proud of this film. Shot in glorious black and white, it is the heart-wrenching story of a group of Jews condemned to the Krakow Ghetto who are saved by a most unlikely guardian angel, a German businessman named Oskar Schindler. Herr Schindler is, at first, only interested in these people as cheap labor that can further enhance his bank account, but somewhere along the way he gains a measure of humanity and is soon taking substantial risks for ""his"" Jews. The movie isn't precisely clear about why this drastic character change takes place, but that hardly matters. The inherent drama of the turbulent situation carries us along for the full three hours, and you'll be hard-pressed not to shed a few tears during the journey. Liam Neeson does a stalwart job of filling the Schindler shoes, not skimping on the little character details while looming larger than life. It has been noted that Neeson has the presence of an old-fashioned movie star and as Schindler, he shows that he knows what to do with it. The real-life Schindler was described as a cross between Curt Jurgens and George Sanders.
Also quietly impressive is that Gandhi guy, Ben Kingsley, as Itzhak, a very clever accountant who is the brains behind the Schindler empire. Newcomer Ralph Fiennes has also copped some Best Supporting Actor awards for his nasty Nazi, Amon Goeth, who heads up the Plaszow forced labor camp. When bored, Goeth picks off unsuspecting prisoners with his rifle from the terrace of his villa. Chilling. The rest of the large cast has been carefully chosen, the script is intelligent, the music is sweeping, and that cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is a knockout. The complaints about Schindler's List are mostly minor. At one point Spielberg feels compelled to use a special-effects trick. It looks like a cheap cut-and-paste job. Couldn't the man who made dinosaurs walk the earth so realistically pull off this relatively simple stunt? The protracted finale also got on my nerves. After the movie climaxes, the director lets it drag on with a heartfelt but misplaced tribute to the actual survivors. Mr. Spielberg, your manipulation is showing.","

"Nazi_Fighter_David","21 January 2002","It's September, 1939. Oskar Schindler is a Nazi-Catholic industrialist from Czechoslovakia, a bon-vivant who realizes that a nice long war in Europe might be an excellent situation for making money... So in a great opening parallel montage, Spielberg depicts the personal journey of one man and the massive journey of one race...As thousand of families are forced to abandon their careers, properties and homes to live in overcrowded ghettos, the scene switches to Schindler, where he pays his way to get a fine table at a fancy nightclub in Nazi-occupied city of Krakow, the surviving gem of Poland's medieval cities...Drinking alone, he scans the strange clientele and slowly sets about casting his nets on the SS German officers... He quickly plied them with food, caviar and French wine... And as a magician, overcoming every resistance, he transforms the separate tables of the cabaret into one joyful drunken party of wine, women, and song for the Nazi officials...The two worlds come together when Schindler meets Itzhak Stern and offers him a deal... Since Jews cannot own businesses, they should work together... Stern's contacts can provide investors, and Stern's expertise can run the business, and Schindler will take care of the presentation...In those same scenes, Amon Goeth is introduced...Goeth is a flabby psychopath who comes to embody the evils of Nazi racism... He is in charge of the camp where the workers are housed and must be bribed and pampered if Schindler is to stay in business... Goeth's excessive cruelty is also part of the reason that Schindler is transformed from an opportunistic 'victimizer' to 'humanitarian.' Liam Neeson portrays Oskar Schindler, the businessman with irresistible charm - the charm of the same magnitude that saved hundreds of innocent people and brightened Schindler's reputation among critical historians... As movie gradually progresses, Schindler's perspective changes much as when he himself states that ""People die - it's a fact of life.""Neeson's flexibility as an actor is impressive... His performance is built on a combination of self-confidence, indecision, and doubt... His character is always evolving, yet always convincing... His transformation from 'war profiteer' to a ""righteous"" man is adequately slow and well developed... As the war draws to a close, Schindler decides unexpectedly to evaluate his life... He turns over his gains into a noble cause - and virtually takes his workers away from being swallowed up by the Holocaust... In one of the film's most touching scenes, Schindler goes to Auschwitz and fights for the freedom of the wives and children of his workers...Ben Kingsley plays the role of Itzhak Stern, the timid gifted accountant, and the silent partner wary of his employer and the enemy... Stern (spared from the horrors of the holocaust) is also Schindler's good angel... He occasionally reminds the audacious man that he could get in a lot of trouble if his true motives are ever discovered... Kingley delivers history's judgment of Oskar Schindler in a touching moment: 'Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.'Ralph Fiennes brilliantly portrays Amon Goethe, the complex study of a sadistic true monster... He is a heartless and cruel killer, with a complicated, twisted personality... Stripped to the waist and overlooking the prison yard, he leaves his mistress Ingrid (Beatrice Macola) in bed to shoot arbitrarily, with his scope rifle, slow-moving Jews from the veranda of his high villa...Goeth despises Jews, yet he inexplicably falls in love with a shy Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz). Rather than allowing himself to touch her, and nearly committing the capital crime of kissing her, he remembers that he is supposed to hate her, and beats her ruthlessly for seducing him...Goeth is a man to despise... But the full scope of his atrocities are not entirely shown... Spielberg shows carefully as much of the horror as the screen can bear...The savage scenes are difficult to watch... Spielberg's camera pans to the pillar of dark smoke rising from the chimney stack into the frightening sky of Auschwitz, and to the lines of Jews unknowingly lead toward the gas chambers...Spielberg captures the terror of the Nazi reign in the terrifying dramatic moments when stunned women and children are mistakenly sent to Auschwitz... The disturbing images of arbitrary murder are harshly realistic...'Schindler's List' assaults the viewer with lasting images of Jewish prisoners announcing their names as they are registered, given work assignments, or separated into ""essential"" and ""non-essential.""Spielberg focuses on children and uses them both as victimizers and victims... In a powerful way to personalize the slaughter without a single word, Spielberg colors the coat of a little girl as she is invisibly making her way, aimless and alone, through the chaotic destruction of the Krakow ghetto... (It's almost the same shade as the jacket worn by the young protagonist of Spielberg's 'Empire of the Sun', in a similar situation when he's alone in a mob and trying to find his way home).'Schindler's List' is a tribute to those who lost their lives in the Holocaust, a dramatic recreation of that dark, frightening period during World War II... The horror is alleviated, slightly, by Janusz Kaminski's stunning Black and White cinematography... The lack of color reminds us of German Expressionist films, and allows Spielberg to be explicit without becoming tastelessly graphic... John Williams' tragic and somber, almost unnoticed score adds to the melancholy tone...Spielberg's great visual moments - when, in a scene, Schindler joins the Nazis on the platform as they fire the cold water at the cars on the desperate, suffocating people inside... 'Schindler's List' is an outstanding movie... It has an important role in adding credibility to the Holocaust, and in Thomas Keneally's fact-based novel, Spielberg finds the right balance of redemption and sorrow.. He makes us watch and feel the extermination through the actions of Oskar Schindler...","

"DennisLittrell","19 April 2000","Steven Spielberg on the holocaust. Naturally the kids are cute even as they are diving into the excrement-filled waters of the latrine to hide from the Nazis... Schindler, played believably by big, handsome Liam Neeson (he was the guy Whoopi Goldberg was panting over at the Oscars last month) is a sweet womanizer who exploits Jewish labor in his factories and then feels guilty about it and ends up saving the lives of eleven hundred. Ben Kingsley plays his accountant with precision and his usual subdued intensity. We have again all the Nazi horror, in some ways worst than ever, and rightly so. Here we see a lot of the random shooting of people. The Nazis just use them for target practice or blow their brains out just to be doing something. The cattle cars are there and the gas ovens and the Nazi psychopaths and all the rest of it, although Spielberg adds some touches like Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi who kept a Jewish woman he was interested in but couldn't love or even rape, but could only beat. And among the guards who are herding the Jews along are a couple who smile at the kids, as though Spielberg is saying, 'here is this juxtaposition: the horror of the most degraded and inhuman acts known to humankind, but look even the monsters think the kids are cute.'We humans ought to have our face rubbed in this at least once a decade. Still I think the concentration camp bits from Sophie's Choice (1982), to which Spielberg owes something, were better. But maybe that's faulty memory. And filming the whole thing in black and white and then turning it all to color with the shot of the actual Jews (now middle-aged) that Schindler saved from the Nazis was a bit stagy, although I have to say showing that one little Jewish girl's red dress (the only bit of color in the movie until the end) was a striking touch: we see her in the red dress when she hides and then when they dig up the bodies we see it again.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)","

"jboothmillard","17 March 2005","The first film from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park) expressing the passion of his Jewish religion (the second - Oscar winner - being Saving Private Ryan) is a brilliant look into the horrific incidents in the Holocaust, based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally. Set in the Nazi German concentration camps of World War II, filled with thousands of innocent Jewish people, where greedy, unsuccessful businessman Oskar Schindler (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Liam Neeson) hoping to make profit from the Jewish slave labour manufacturing. Later we are introduced to one of the lead villains, overseeing the progress of the camp, the evil Amon Goeth (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ralph Fiennes). As time goes by, more and more Jews are trying to escape capture, torture and death by the Nazis, Oskar sees how much pain and suffering these innocent souls are going through, and starts having changes in heart. So with the help of friend and almost colleague Itzhak Stern (BAFTA nominated Sir Ben Kingsley) they begin to type a list (hence the title) for all the Jews he can afford to buy and take away to another camp for a new manufacturing business. He manages to ""evacuate"" approximately 1,100 victims, and he becomes the unlikely hero (after not doing much earlier) by releasing all of them. Also starring Caroline Goodall as Emilie Schindler, Jonathan Sagall as Poldek Pfefferberg, Embeth Davidtz as Helen Hirsch and Malgoscha Gebel as Victoria Klonowska. There are horrific and memorable moments of realistic suffering, torture and death, a hideous real villain and a great unlikely real hero, moments of colour (i.e. the beginning, the girl with the red coat, and the ending) and a teary ending with many survivors paying their respects at Schindler's grave. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Best Sound, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up Artist, Best Production Design and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture, and it was nominated for Best Original Score.

"Thanos_Alfie","12 August 2013","""Schindler's List"" is one of the best directed films of Steven Spielberg. It is the true story of Oskar Schindler a businessman who becomes a savior of the Jews despite the barbaric Nazi reign.All starts when Oskar Schindler builds his factory into a refuge for Jews taken advantage of the dealing that Jews had from Nazi. So he began his profitable business but while he continues it and sees and considers what Nazi do to Jews he changes his factory into a refuge for Jews.I think the performance of Liam Neeson is his best performance of all times. This film it can likened with another movies such as ""Life is beautiful"" and ""The Pianist"" which are also very good movies.","

"werefox08","3 September 2012","Although there are a lot of harrowing images in this excellent movie, I have a feeling no film has ever really shown the true graphic horrors of the death camps. I am sure that movie...will be made someday. There so many Jewish people being murdered in this fine motion picture, but,...in the end it is about a brave man being totally psychologically transformed. Months of seeing human beings being brutalized and getting to know them (his factory used the Jews as cheap labor) as individuals, made Nazi Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) change dramatically. This is not the usual Steven Spielberg fare. He directs this with a deft touch. The holocaust should NEVER be forgotten...and man should have learned from it. Unfortunately since this catastrophic human disaster there have been more cases of ""ethnic cleansing"". ""When will we ever learn ?""","

"arahansehrawat","1 September 2017","Schindler's genius is in bribing, scheming, conning. He knows nothing about running a factory and finds Itzhak Stern, a Jewish accountant, to handle that side of things. Stern moves through the streets of Krakow, hiring Jews for Schindler. Because the factory is a protected war industry, a job there may guarantee longer life. The relationship between Schindler and Stern is developed by Spielberg with enormous subtlety. At the beginning of the war, Schindler wants only to make money... and at the end he wants only to save ""his"" Jews. We know that Stern understands this. But there is no moment when Schindler and Stern bluntly state what is happening, perhaps because to say certain things aloud could result in death.","

"baumer","5 July 1999","Human beings are the only species that kills for sport and hunts for pleasure.  We may be the only species ( next to a cat ) that takes joy in killing and torturing another person or animal.  Why God gave us the capacity to experience these heinous emotions and desires is beyond me. But for whatever reason, we do have them, and the Holocaust is one of the darkest periods in our existence as human beings.  There certainly are other dark times but this one is the most talked about and famous.  And before I saw this film, I knew the Holocaust was horrible, but when you can put visuals to the words, it gives you a whole new appreciation and understanding of what is one disgusting display of inhumanity towards a people.  And from a man that gave us films like Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, many may have not expected to see a masterpiece like this. But no one should ever be surprised at what Spielberg can accompish.Schindler's List gives you the horror right in your mind.  It paints pictures in front of you and you cringe with every stroke of cinematic genius that is presented before you.  I felt sad and disgusted to watch the horrors before me.  It made me sick to see that humans could be so cruel. Do we not have any compassion towards the living?  Apparently not.  And this film shows that, along with Mississippi Burning, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan and even pictures like Boyz N The Hood, we are a sad creation and one that whoever is the supreme ruler of us has got to be angry at the way we turned out.This is one of the most important films ever made and it also one of the most disturbing.  I walked out of the theater and when we drove home there was four of us ) not one word was uttered for at least a half an hour.  It was like it took us that long to process what we had just witnessed.  When the converstion did start, it went deep into the night and early into the morning.  It will provoke that kind of reaction from most everybody.As important and as brilliant of a film as this is ( I rate it a ten out of ten ) I only saw it once at the theater and then only through the most persistant of begging, once more on video four years later.  It disturbed me too much.  The images were too real for me and it gave me nightmares for a few days later.  What Spielberg has done here is not only make an important film, he has taken a subject that causes so many people pain and he has opened it up for the rest of us to understand.  And for that, no Oscar can ever repay him for his contribution to society.  I know I am a changed person because of this film.  And to me, Saving Private Ryan could have almost been an unofficial sequel to Schindler's List.  They both have opened my eyes to the horrors that mankind has caused.Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan are proof that Speilberg is the king of Hollywood.  I sincerely hope he makes an Indy 4, but I hope he continues to make films that make us think.  Because he is damn good at those ones too.","

"sharky_55","19 September 2015","Spielberg once stated that Schindler's List is not about the millions that were killed during the Holocaust, but rather about the one thousand that were saved. It's a very important thing to consider when looking at some of the criticisms levelled at this great film. There have been documentaries that have attempted to capture the atrocities of the Holocaust but even so none come close to the unflinching and systematic mass murder of the event. Schindler's List doesn't attempt to provide an substantial and unbiased view of it. It is a story about one man in particular and his absolute good. Even so, the film does attempt to place itself within the reality of the events and create some sense of authenticity. Apart from the powerful bookends which are drenched in colour, the black and white documentary approach serves its agelessness and heightens the intensity of some scenes; the first look we get at the enigma of Oskar Schindler, catch-lights hitting his twinkling eyes at the party, or when a little boy attempts to hide in the underground box full of sewerage. Hand- held is also used intensively and to great effect - the rounding up of naked Jews, the extended liquidation scene, scrambling around the camp in madness in avoiding a psychopath with a sniper rifle. Spielberg doesn't overdose the film with visual tricks but shows it for what it is (the lack of storyboarding aided this), making those little touches all the more effective - quick match cuts to show the various inept secretaries that are hired anyway, Kingley's distant voice-over as Goeth executes lined up boys silently and mercilessly, and the most powerful motif of them all, the girl in the red coat, a symbol of innocence lost and atrocity committed. There are two exceptional performances here. The first is of course Neeson, who brings to the table a great charisma and pragmaticism that later dissolves into sympathy and great courage. We first are charmed like the German officers at the party (I love the great touch of the officer moving forward to get closer to Oskar in the photo, obscuring the pretty girl he was initially wooing), and through voice-over and a photo we receive those charms again through the lavish gifts of champagne, caviar and sardines. Spielberg does not create a moment of realisation or change; it is a gradual and subtle process that Oskar goes through. He is not the morally pure and idealistic man we look for in a Hollywood production such as this - he initially hires an entire group of secretaries not to save them, but to further his womanising and marital affairs, and when a one-armed man comes to thank him for saving his life, Neeson's face is struck and visibly confused; we wonder if he has ever been the receiver of such sincerity and gratitude. But that changes when he realises the gravity of the situation (""He was a metal press operator""). Oskar's front is of course the affable German business man, concerned only about profit, but in glimpses he shows his true humanity and courage in front of the Nazis: a long kiss on his birthday, a determination to see worker's thirsts quenched, and in that final teary-eyed heart wrenching monologue, a complete reversal of his ambitions. John Williams' iconic violin theme is stirring and most evident here. The other is Fiennes' Goeth, who takes a despicable monster and adds tiny tinges of humanity that make his character all the more terrifying. His introduction is telling, a faceless POV in the back of the car before we reveal him, not some intimidating figure, but an irritated man with a cold: ""Ja, why is the top down? I'm f*cking freezing."" Another one of these moments is a brilliant scene where he corners Helen in the baseless, shivering and terrified. Goeth ignores this, constructing a rather tender conversation in his mind, and we witness a insatiable conflict in his mind, unbelieving that he has fallen for a ""jew bitch"". He almost gives in, but his Nazi sensibilities come back to him and he strikes her. This segment is brilliantly inter cut with kisses of another location, the modest Jewish wedding and the lavish birthday party where Oskar kisses many. This man is truly barbaric, and even a clever appeal to his ego from Oskar (""I pardon you."") does not satisfy his cold murderous streak. What Fiennes does is give us a tiny bit of insight into a man like Goeth, because to us it seems inexplicable that such a man could do such sadistic things and be instrumental in genocide. And so, he loses Helen over a game of 21. They bargain over the life of these essential jew workers, and Goeth's question to Schindler is perhaps a moment of realisation of what he must do. One little moment in the montage of compiling the list is a overlooked appearance from another Righteous Among the Nations, Julius Madritsch, who save thousands of Jews himself. I am struck by how his story and many others could similarly be rightfully portrayed as a compelling act of bravery in the face of such evil, much like Oskar Schindler's. His story was almost never told; a fateful encounter between writer Thomas Keneally and a Schindler's Jew in Poldek Pfefferberg was the basis of a book and later this film. Pfefferberg's own words are particularly telling about this great man: ""Schindler gave me my life, and I tried to give him immortality."" And in this film, he has achieved it.","

"hall895","10 July 2012","Oskar Schindler did not set out to be a hero. He set out to make money. He was a war profiteer, making money off of the misfortune of Poland's Jews. They were cheap, easy labor. But somewhere along the way things changed. Schindler saw what was happening all around him. The extermination of a people was underway. And in these circumstances a hero was made. For Schindler it was no longer about making money. It was about saving Jews. His Jews. Amidst the darkness of the most unspeakable of horror there was a small light shining bright. Yes, the number of those who were saved pales in comparison to the number of those lost. But this story, and this film, shows us that there can be something good even where all seems so impossibly bad. Even in the worst of circumstances there is room for hope. There is room for a hero.Setting the right tone for this film seems an impossible task. You have to celebrate those who were saved. But you must also honor those who were lost. Steven Spielberg walked this fine line wonderfully. He told his uplifting story of Oskar Schindler. But the bigger picture was never lost. The horror of what took place comes through very clearly. Spielberg does not just tell the story of those saved, he makes it vividly and brutally clear just what they were saved from. The pain, anguish, horror and terror is all very real. Seeing the greatest evil the world has known on display is enough to make you lose your faith in humanity. Seeing the bravery and heroism of Oskar Schindler restores that faith.Spielberg was fortunate in that he had three terrific performers to work with. Liam Neeson played Schindler so beautifully. Here was a character who evolved so much over the course of the film and Neeson was pitch-perfect each step of the way. War-profiteering Nazi or heroic savior of Jews, whatever the moment called for Neeson nailed it every time while maintaining an air of mystery. Who was Oskar Schindler really, why did he do the things he did? He was an enigma who Neeson portrayed wonderfully. Ben Kingsley played Schindler's accountant Itzhak Stern. At first Schindler and Stern have very different motivations. But a bond is formed, a friendship blooms. And Stern plays his part in helping to save his people. A quiet, yet determined, presence whom Kingsley personifies so well. And then there is Ralph Fiennes portraying one of history's true madmen, the disgustingly evil Amon Goeth. Any story of a hero needs a villain and Goeth, as played chillingly by Fiennes, is as villainous as they come. Perhaps the scariest thing about him is that there are moments of humanity, kindness even. But in the blink of an eye the moment is gone and the homicidal monster is there before us. Kingsley is very good, Neeson is terrific but Fiennes absolutely takes your breath away. He makes this monster his own, an acting performance of the absolute highest quality.The three stars certainly play a big part in the success of the film. But Spielberg makes such great use of so many performers. Some play characters who we get to know a little bit. Many are nameless, just part of the multitude being led to the slaughter. The hordes in the ghetto and in the camps convey the magnitude and the great sadness of what went on. Spielberg holds nothing back in portraying the manner in which these people were dehumanized. And the specter of death always looms. It's a film of over three hours in length which does not seem nearly that long. It grips you throughout, never lets up, never lets you go. And there are some moments which are nearly unbearable, the tension unlike anything you've ever seen. One scene in a shower may well have your heart beating through your chest. And you're just watching, people actually lived this. This was such a challenging story to tell and Spielberg tells it so well. The Holocaust is an odd place to look for a hero. But here a hero was found. And Oskar Schindler's story is one we can all remember when we are ready to give up hope for this world.","

"Hessian499","28 October 2001","Excellent film, and probably the best movie made in the 1990s. Schindler's List is a somewhat long film and definitely not something for small children to see, but it is an intense story that will still be relevant 100 years from now. Filmed in black and white (an effective idea by Spielberg), the Holocaust is show in unsanitized form, and you do not forget the images once you see them. Instead of just showing footage of the camp, Spielberg digs deeply into the minds and psyche of both the prisoners and the Nazis and we learn what their motivations and hopes are. By looking deeply at the Nazis, they come across as complex individuals and not just faceless monsters, something that had not been explored previously in other films about the Holocaust; they are still portrayed as incredibly evil as they were in history, but Spielberg does a good job of explaining their psychology to us, which adds to the understanding of the Holocaust. Not a pleasant film to watch at all, but a movie that must be seen.","

"sickofenjoyingmyself","10 March 2015","I can't believe I waited until the age of 29 years old to finally watch a movie I had been planning to view for years but never got around to. I knew that the story would exert an emotional toll on me but I finally found my chance to watch it through last week and it was worth the wait. This is magnificent and emotional viewing. Based on an inspiring true story that is enough to restore one's faith in mankind. The acting all round is incredible. Neeson is understated - although I have read that he wasn't entirely happy with his performance in hindsight. Kingsley was even more understated. Ralph Fiennes was simply incredible. Totally twisted, believably merciless - he portrays exactly what you would expect of a debauched, unapologetic and excessive Nazi. The overall mood is extremely sad. Some of the scenes that depicted actual events that happened in our world, by human beings - are utterly gut wrenching, heartless and terrifying. The horror of the mass shower scene was an unforgettable experience - by not showing what you expected to see - it seemed to create even more empathy with the helpless fear of the situation. To tackle such historical atrocity is a monumental task indeed. Schindler's list shows us every side to the events that shook, and still continue to shake the world. The horror, the senselessness, the bravery, the hope, the fear, the courage, the evil. The greatest purpose of all that this exceptional movie serves - we must never forget what happened. There are some things that can never be forgotten or forgiven. And there are some people, like Oskar Schindler, whose actions carry a weight that will never be forgotten by all of those who's lives were saved. A remarkable movie about an inspirational man.","

"leplatypus","31 March 2012","This movie is about ordinary people showing the best of humanity or unfortunately the worse. As my favorite writer, PKD, said holocaust wasn't only Hitler and his pals but began foremost with those thousands of anonymous Germans, Polish, Ukrainians, French that operated the camps, the trains, opened the doors and close them, brought the lethal gas and so on. Everyone would contribute even small in the process was as guilty as their original planners. Shoah is about individual morals and value and it was up to every one to choose the path to be a killer or a righteous. The movie is brilliant for that because you see that thousands of anonymous killers and one brave soul who repents. Sure, it's greed that leads Oskar to those families but it's their suffering that makes him change. From that point of view, i don't think that the girl who wore red is an error as other people think because she symbolizes his borderline. From this moment, Oskar is touched and is on duty: Liam becomes really irresistible of empathy and courage. Next, some french media consider a bigger flaw that the women's convoy is only lead to shower and not death chambers. Well, that's the proof that they haven't understood Spielberg's sensibility: he doesn't direct a documentary but as always, a movie about hope, about this little flame that still burns in the darkest hours. So he didn't have to show those woman dying as well as he could mix a lot of atrocities that surely hasn't all happened in the real Schindler's story but happens really during the war: killing disabled, killing for fun, etc... In that way, Fiennes and Liam delivers unforgettable performances, the one as an unforgettable pit of darkness and the other as a force of life. That's why my eyes were full of tears at the end because to see this strong oak finally crumble was too much. Pairing: ""Empire of the sun"": another war, another tragedy, another hope....","

"nairtejas","1 July 2013","Astounded by the facts, grueling scenes & short scripts between the sequences, I find myself in an awkward situation where instead of thinking about which movie to watch next, I am introspecting about the purpose of my life. Seriously, this film makes it a point that you get emotionally inspired.Steven Spielberg, as always, takes up a sensitive topic and carves it to perfection. Not taking in account the long running time (which is actually pretty fair) & the imbalance of narration, the story of Oskar Schindler saving a bunch of innocent Jews from the clutches of callous German Kommandants strikes a visual chord mentally, emotionally. The heart-aching depiction of cruelty on Jews, rampant corruption during World War, slavery & the magnanimity of Schindler, his friendship, his aura is all well filmed. The music almost backs it up, with wonderful screenplay & cinematography.Liam Neeson is terrific. I have always loved his performances; this one makes me respect him more & more. Ben Kingsley is very very good, especially with his demeanor. Supporting cast is amazing. In fact, the whole crew should get a standing ovation for the hard-work of digging up the facts. The final sequences made me cry.BOTTOM LINE: A 9.3/10 for this must-watch, characteristic film. One of the most emotionally touching films.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"ketgup83","15 December 2010","Schindler's list was an astounding work of cinema which was depressing and emotional but at the same time was backed by powerful performances and intelligent direction. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Oskar Schindler is a German Businessman who hires Jewish people in Germany to work in his factory during World War II. During the tenure, Schindler realizes that the Jews are brutally abused, tortured, misbehaved and murdered. As the ill-treatment on Jews, Schindler tries to help these people with his wealth, powerful friends. Later when Germany untimely surrenders , Schindler is forced to quit but he leaves behind wonderful memories of helping the Jews. The film was a masterpiece. The astounding piece of work could only be achieved by Steven Spielberg. The great director not only tells emotional story about the cruelty suffered by the Jews but also the showcases that money is not everything. The way a business tycoon helps his workers despite the ill-treatment they were suffering was eye-catching. Though the running time of the film was 3 hours but it will keep you engrossed . Direction was fantabulous. Cinematography was jaw-dropping. Same goes with the sets. Talking about performance, Liam Nesson essays the role of Schindler with T. The actor not looks good but comes up with a brave performance. In supporting , Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes acted their part with equal justice. So overall, I was completely moved by the film. It has all the ingredients to make a good dramadialoggood background score.","

"Phil_H","24 August 1999","Although I didn't give Schindler's List a ""10"" rating for the IMDB, in fact I gave it a ""9"", I must say this: Schindler's List is the best movie ever made.The horror of the genocide is made clear, as well as the potential humanity of onlookers.  One powerful message--that people can make a difference. Good people can, and do, save lives everyday.There's a tag-line for the film, it's from the Talmud, ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.""  If so, then Schindler just saved the world 1200 times.  He saved it for you, for me;  for all of us.I have seen many films, fiction, documentary, and otherwise that deal with the horrors of the Holocaust.  Nothing moved me as this has.  I've seen Schindler's List many times.  I love it.  It never fails to move me.We need more people like Schindler, we need more movies like Schindler's List.","

I feel compelled to watch it annually and still can not appreciate what it takes from an actor, a director, a cinematographer to participate and place themselves in such dark and terrifying places. The acting is simply mesmerizing and Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth goes beyond the embodiment of a Nazi. You can actually see the development of evil as a duty. Difficult to not feel every moment yet more important to never forget this film that recounts The Holocaust on a scale unmatched.","

"nadrojh","22 July 2017","Schindler's List is a great drama about the holocaust. It is both well written and directed. I haven't read the book or done much research. However it does tell a touching story of a man trying to save life in a very dark time in history. Steven Spielberg did an incredible job directing. There was so much detail in each scene. I liked the use of black and white it gave this sad tragic story a dark and gloomy tone. It also has a wonderful ending. It has a large wonderful cast with incredible performances by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes. I was surprised by the amount of negative user reviews I seen. Schindler's List is a great drama about a tragic time in history. It isn't a movie you can watch over and over, but it is a movie that should be seen. It ties with Saving Private Ryan as Steven Spielberg's best work. It is also one of the best movies from 1990's. It is a great movie.","

"lagudafuad","4 September 2012","Schindler's List tells the tale of a German industrialist Oskar Schindler (28 April 1908 – 9 October 1974) who was credited to have saved over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust.The movie is based on the book Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally. Steven Spielberg both directed and produced this movie, and has been received widely as a classic.The thing that catches your eye when watching this movie is the cruelty of war itself, there are just mainly losers no winners, only those who happen to be in-between that suffers, the men behind it sit behind a desk. Spielberg depicted such cruelty in the Camps.A scene where a Jew who made hinges was moved from where he is working to go shove coal and then when he was done he returned, Amon Göth (Ralph Fiennes) queried him for not meeting up to his regular toll of hinges and immediately had him arraigned to be executed, for something that was not his fault. That scene touched me.The movie was shot in Kraków, Poland for seventy-one days. Shots were done in real life locations, though the Płaszów camp had to be reconstructed in a pit adjacent to the original site, due to post-war changes to the original camp.The plot of the movie is direct; a German businessman named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) in Poland sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using bribes to win military contracts, and bringing in an accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory.He then hires Jews for the cheap pay, but later after witnessing the cruelty they face in the Nazi Camps, he then tried to get as much Jews away from the Camps to his factory, using all his savings to take care of them.The movie is not so bad when it comes to acting, but the main hat dipping should go to the Screenplay and the directing. The Screenplay and the script had to be perfect in other for us to be able to get the feel of what the Jews were going through. Also the directing had to be top notch so as not to get carried away by the suffering or the cruelty but to understand why a German will like to save the Jews.Although we know that much has been done by Liam Neeson (Taken), Ralph Fiennes (Harry Potter) and Ben Kingsley (Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time) over the years, but they will be fondly remembered for their role in this classic.Take a 3 hour break from your busy schedule and watch this movie. It is one of a kind.","

"jose-cruz53","16 October 2012","This film is a very solid offering from a not so solid director, Spielberg, who made some solid films, such as E.T. and Raiders of the Lost Ark, but never managed to attain greatness, until this film. Easily the best film he ever made, Spielberg showed that he is also able to direct serious stuff besides escapist adventure films. I would put this film among my top 50 favorite films.This film is technically flawless and shows how sophisticated Hollywood filmaking had become by the early 1990's. Though I would question the use of black and white in the film: color is good and the Pianist showed it can be used in a WW2 tragedy film. However, this film is not the best WW2 film ever made either, Grave of the Fireflies, by Isao Takahata, a film detailing the suffering of two children to survive in Japan in the final months of WW2, is easily superior to this one and if you think this film is sad, thy watching Takahata's masterpiece.","

"ShelbyTMItchell","28 March 2013","Probably one of the best films that I have ever seen. Really haunting but true. Along with sad but it is about the human race along with how hard these people in Germany had to deal with the brutality and harshness of the Nazis! By having thousands of them work for Oskar Schinder in his factory and hiding them. As that was at the time an overlooked thing before the movie was made. As how thousands were saved from the death camps of Germany.Steven Spielberg proved he could direct the best pic ever in his career after the Academy voters did not take him for real at the time. Only thinking he could do blockbusters. But with this film, he shows the point of view of WWII Germany. At the time of the Third Reich. Plus him being Jewish really makes it authentic.It is shown in Black and White as Spielberg says that if there was color, it would not be a historically realistic as it would had been. Glad that he kept it in B&W! Liam Neeson gives an outstanding performance as the protagonist and war profiteer Oskar Schindler. Who turned his greed into humanity by saving lots and lots of Jews from the Nazis and Hitler. As he felt compassion on them.Ralph Fiennes turns into a haunting performance in his breakthrough role of the main antagonist, Amon Goeth as he shows no mercy to those people that are under his command. He steals every single scene in the film with his evilness.Ben Kingsley does a great job as Neeson's right hand man. As he shows compassion and sympathy as kind of a spokesman for his people and an accountant by trade.This movie needs to be seen through all generations. And that it is nearly 20 years old but seems like only yesterday that it was made! Very good acting, writing, and makes you feel like you are there!","

"Dodger-9","16 January 2001","In the same week that ET opened in America, Steven Spielberg read Thomas Keneally's Schindler's Ark, the book based on the true story of one man who rescued more than 1,000 Jews from under the noses of the Nazis.
Intrigued by the subject, the film rights were snapped up and the result was the most talked about movie of the Nineties.Schindler's List rarely fails to stir the emotions. As with all of the cast - especially Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes - Liam Neeson gives the performance of a lifetime as the suave businessman Oskar Schindler, spurred on by the brief that as many people as possible should see the movie - and not just from a commercial point of view, as Neeson recalled at the time of release.`I remember Steven saying Don't take this wrong, but I want everyone in the world to see this film,' and I knew exactly what he meant.'It goes without saying that the Holocaust was such an horrific event that any director would have to feel mature enough to tell their story without letting sentiment get in the way. So, 10 years after he first read the book, the master movie-maker was ready to tackle the most important film of his career.He had a self-confessed reluctance to confront the Holocaust and his own Jewishness as a subject. Following his more human' dramas such as The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun, the project was still very much in his mind, but his own involvement would be purely on a production level. After offering it to fellow film directors Martin Scorsese and Sydney Pollack, they both turned it down and Hollywood's favourite son was left to condense the novel into a three-hour black and white movie.Having successfully fleshed out many of his childhood fantasies and with events in the Balkans at the time mirroring those of fifty years earlier, 1993 was exactly the right time to address the matter.So keen was Spielberg to make the film, he left the Hawaiian set of Jurassic Park before the film's completion and flew to Poland to start filming.Old friend George Lucas was left to edit the dinosaur blockbuster while Steven watched the footage on descrambled satellite transmissions.Both films went on to achieve widespread acclaim, for different reasons. If JP was the sort of a movie an overexcited child would make, then SL was that of a seasoned film-maker at ease with his craft and intent on delivering something extremely adult.Schindler's List received 12 Oscar nominations, including the elusive Best Director gong which Steven eventually picked up from an Academy that had ignored many of his movies on the grounds that he had been rewarded enough.Tackling a drama in which six million people ended up dead was not for the novice film-maker - It was for the brave of heart and a director that could tell such a stark tale without alienating his audience from the outset.Indeed, only Claude Lanzmann had delivered anything that came close with his epic film Shoah, a nine and a half hour documentary about the Holocaust which wowed the critics in 1985.For his movie, Spielberg was blessed with a polished screenplay by Steve Zaillian, a young writer who went on to direct his own movies such as the John Travolta vehicle, A Civil Action, and who has just spruced up the dialogue for Silence of the Lambs sequel, Hannibal.Needless to say, this not the sort of movie you curl up with on a Saturday night with a box of chocs and a six pack. It's a harrowing film which has lost none of its power either on the small screen or in the eight years since its release.","

The movie is not afraid to be highly brutal and it does an amazing job showing us the ugliness of the concentration camps. All movies of this genre should not be afraid to have this element of brutality and Schindler's List does it perfectly. It does a great job making us care for Schindler and I can tell that Spielberg really cared for him and his actions. It's a very powerful film and the fact that this was based on a true story only strengthens the emotional power. The fact that it was shot in black and white undoubtedly gives it more power and emotion. Saying this movie was expertly shot would be an understatement. I've never seen a film shot better then this. This is a one of a kind film and we may never see it duplicated. It hits all the elements perfectly and succeeds in every way. This is one of the best movies of all time and it must be watched.","

""Schindler's List"" is one of the mature, adult dramas.It is a 3 hour long epic of a film, shot in beautiful black and white. The black and white photography works perfectly with the emotional John Williams score and tough subject matter. For some reason, the images of snowy areas were really beautiful to me, and I can't explain exactly why this minor element added so much to the film for me.Spielberg explicitly shows the brutality of the Nazis, and how awful the Holocaust truly was. In this film, the shaky cam actually works to the film's advantage! It isn't over the top or distracting in any way, and makes the film feel like a kind of gritty documentary at times. It actually adds to the film, rather than ruining it!This film is just a masterpiece on every single level. There is great acting, music, cinematography, and so on...I know why the film is so universally loved. While still being brutal, ""Schindler's List"" is a very touching and powerful piece of cinema about a truly great man.

"gavin6942","4 November 2014","In Poland during World War II, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazis.Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself. Indeed, the biggest criticism the film gets is that it came from Spielberg, well known for his sentimentality. Had another director made the same film, it would probably be considered flawless.One can wonder about the casting of Liam Neeson as a Moravian German, when he clearly is not. But with such a strong acting ability, this can be overlooked. The casting of Ben Kingsley was brilliant, even if he is not Jewish, and it is a shame this role is not the one he is best known for. Somehow Ralph Fiennes got a supporting actor nomination, but not Kingsley? The choice to film in black and white makes sense, as Spielberg wanted a ""documentary"" feel. Does the infusion of red take away from this? Some might say so.This film racked up a slew of awards, including several Oscars, and this is well-deserved. Despite its critics, this will no doubt go on to be considered one of the greatest films of all time, and easily the best to address the Holocaust.","

"AaronCapenBanner","18 September 2013","Steven Spielberg won a well-deserved Academy Award(as did the film itself) for directing this emotionally shattering, dramatically devastating film about opportunistic businessman Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson in a superb performance) who goes into business with the Nazis, and Amon Goeth(Ralph Fiennes, unforgettable performance) the death camp commandant who supplies him with imprisoned Jews for his factories. Ben Kingsly plays Itzhak Stern, his secretary who helps Schindler have a moral awakening to the evils of the Nazis, and who later spends his fortune aiding them, eventually shielding them from extermination, saving over 1100 lives.Masterpiece is among the finest films ever made, so deeply moving and wrenchingly does it portray the death camps and what the Jewish people had to endure(aided by the exquisite John Williams score), and Amon Goeth personified evil as he indifferently shot the prisoners, or abused his maid.The ending to the film when Schindler breaks down, and the Jews are liberated is powerful enough for several films, but the Coda at the end is so surprising, yet so fitting, that it remains the most emotionally moving ending ever. A stunning achievement for all concerned, especially Mr. Spielberg.","

"futures-1","24 January 2006","""Schindler's List"" (1993): I see this Monument repeatedly. It's brilliant and powerful, from start to finish. YOU should see it first, in it's entirety, if you're contemplating your children being exposed. Spielberg made his own ""parental warning"" introduction, when it aired  unedited - on t.v. (a gutsy and triumphant moment for television). I would WANT my children to see it, as long as we had some preparation first, and PLENTY of discussion time after wards. Of course, this is an emotional and horrific story, scene after scene, full of dark insights at every turn, but it is the spiritual growth of Oskar Schindler  NOT an admirable man when we first meet him  that becomes one of the inspiring forces. Liam Neesom was great in this role, which helped make ""Schindler's List"" one of my Top Five for supreme Character Studies. You will also see a typically subdued Ben Kingsley, and a brilliant, frighteningly evil-yet-torn, Ralph Fiennes. The music is not overwhelming, but present and effective. The camera work and lighting for this black & white work of Art are flawless. The use of a few tiny moments of color (aside from the start and finish), aren't really necessary, and a little overly poetic, but aren't bothersome. During the film, I often want to vomit, or cry, or scream. I'm glad I feel these things. Steven Spielberg never has to prove anything to anyone ever again...even if he makes another ""E.T."" or ""War of the Worlds"".","

This movie just gives a glimpse of the possible effects if the power is vested with some insane person with a mindless hatred towards a group of people just because of their birth. I had not judged Hitler to the fullest before seeing this movie even though many were condemning him to be the cruelest dictator the world has ever seen. After seeing it, I am convinced of the fact that he was really so. The fact that 6 million Jews were massacred during the world war-2 just because they were Jews is a shame on the entire humanity.The movie gives an account of the polish Jews during the Second World War and how the protagonist, Oscar Schindler saves 1200 Jews from being gassed. The cinematography is simply brilliant. It gives a sense of timelessness to the movie. Also, not to forget some wonderful performances. All factors make the movie very realistic. No wonder it is one of the best movies in many lists and deservedly won the academy award for the year 1993. Steven Spielberg will be remembered as an iconic director even if all of his other movies are discounted.In the days where negationism of the Nazis' atrocities is getting stronger and the killings are being justified, this movie is a harsh reminiscence of the black era of Europe.","

"nunculus","27 October 1999","The critic Terrence Rafferty put it best: SCHINDLER'S LIST has a primal emotional power that hasn't been felt since silent film.
Those who prefer the post-structuralist beard-scratching of Claude Lanzmann's unbearable SHOAH to this movie are denying the potency of great populist art. Like Dickens and Griffith, Spielberg uses melodramatic techniques to make ideas palpable to a mass audience. In America at least, public perception of the Holocaust will be forever changed. You can carp that the audience's experience is synthetic, Disneyish, but is a fictional re-experiencing of these events worse than an abstract and remote noodling over them? Is it worse to represent the Holocaust in fiction than to leave it as a concept--and, as history bears out, a deniable one?As a work of filmmaking, it ranks with the greatest. In LIST, Spielberg arrives at a point--shoulder to shoulder with Scorsese --as the most dexterous and gifted of filmmakers working today. Scene after scene displays an offhand, unplanned-feeling mastery of the medium that staggers the imagination in its power. The cumulative effect--as in the best of Spielberg's earlier work--is of a long and sustained, almost unbearable cry of loss. Intellectuals have come to so despise Steven Spielberg, the mogul of Century City, that they have become blind to Spielberg the craftsman and artist. (Spielberg's smarm while receiving his first Academy Award didn't help this perception.) SCHINDLER'S LIST is the only film I've seen in my adult life where the screen disappeared; I was no longer aware of the construction of the movie and entered into it as spontaneously as a child. Surely Spielberg will never again find material that engages him so profoundly. But this film, far dwarfing its aspiring successor SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, places Spielberg at the first rank of film artists.","

"StevePulaski","4 June 2011","For a movie as monumental as Schindler's List, I believe a review should be conducted in a different style. Normally, my reviews consist of multiple paragraphs, summarizing the plot and my thoughts on the film. This time I want to give five reasons why Schindler's List was easily one of the most powerful and breathtaking motion pictures I've ever seen. It goes above and beyond anyone's expectation, and cements itself on the list of greatest films of all time. Here's why.1. Acting. No one could write about Schindler's List and not talk about Liam Neeson's Oscar worthy performance as Oskar Schindler, the business man from Czechoslovakia. He plays it with power and full force, grade A acting. Still shocked his leading performance didn't win him the Oscar in 1994.2. Storyline. Instead of focusing on one of the survivors, or a fictional story for that matter, Spielberg chooses to focus on Oskar Schindler, a rather unsung chapter and character of The Holocaust. Oskar Schindler worked for the Nazis, and is famous for using his great wealth to buy hundreds of Jews to make them work in his factory. It wasn't much, but it prevented death, and they would make bowls for the Nazis. Even though the film goes into a subject, some may not know, the storyline is definitely one of the strongest points.3. The end sequence. I don't want to ruin the final scenes in the film, but let's just say, it's one of the most effective and well done scenes in film history.4. The film's desire to ""show it all."" When Holocaust movies are made, so try to water the film down by not showing the terrible treatment of innocent Jews. This one doesn't. Despite the event being gruesome, tasteless, and ignorant, no movie should subject itself to water down the scenes. Unless it's PG-13, and I doubt many Holocaust movies are. Schindler's List isn't all about the gas chambers and things most of us already know. We witness two of the worst things possible; (1) innocent people taken out to the yard and being shot in the head with absolutely no feeling on the guard's part and (2) we see the heart-wrenching scenes of peoples belonging getting tossed off balconies like garbage. That part I almost couldn't bear to watch.5. The complete carelessness for human life. Face it, the Jews and many other races were dehumanized come time of The Holocaust. Life didn't matter to anybody. You could tell a Nazi officer that you just killed sixty thousand Jews in one day and they wouldn't flinch, yell, smile, or object. They would say ""Good work."" They wouldn't take into consideration you just killed sixty thousand mothers, father, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, and worst of all, children of both sexes. One scene in the film, right before a woman is shot in the head, the camera zooms in on her to show her frightened reactions, her pale face, and her clearly nervous behavior. Spielberg most likely did that to remind viewers that the victims in this movie were people and they were innocent people with their own feelings in life. Dehumanization lived in The Holocaust.Schindler's List currently ranks number nine on the American Film Institute's (AFI) list of one hundred greatest American films ever made. I am a firm believer that if this wasn't in Spielberg's hands, it wouldn't touch that list. Thankfully, we get one down to Earth and very vibrant Holocaust movies that manages to accomplish what it should. Just an all around amazing film.Starring: Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Caroline Goodall, Jonathan Sagall, and Embeth Davidtz. Directed by: Steven Spielberg.","

"sme_no_densetsu","17 September 2012","Circa 1993, Steven Spielberg was arguably the biggest name in Hollywood. The world had just seen ""Jurassic Park"" become the third of his films to take over top spot in the list of the highest grossing films of all time. Then, for an encore, he delivered ""Schindler's List""; the film that finally brought him Oscar recognition.The story is based on a factual novel by Thomas Keneally about a German businessman who moves to Poland during WWII in the hopes of making his fortune as a war profiteer. He thrives with the aid of Jewish slave labour but as the war progresses he becomes increasingly concerned about the safety of his work force. Eventually, he resolves to sacrifice his wealth in an attempt to shield his workers from certain death at the hands of the Nazis.The screenplay by Steven Zaillian is a strong one and it ended up resulting in an Oscar win. The tone can be grim at times as the film unflinchingly portrays the nightmare of German occupation. With a runtime of more than three hours, the film is somewhat gruelling early on but you eventually get so wrapped up in the story that the time passes quickly. Zaillian should also be commended for not portraying Schindler as a man without fault; rather, he is an unlikely hero.The cast also rises to the occasion. It's no surprise that the always dependable Liam Neeson landed an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Schindler but it is surprising that this is his only nomination to date. Meanwhile, Ralph Fiennes, in his breakout role, basically stole the show as Nazi commandant Amon Goeth. Also deserving of high praise was Ben Kingsley, whose low-key performance spoke volumes.Visually, the film is exceptional. The black and white cinematography of Janusz Kaminski is stunning and Spielberg's direction is impeccable. Both individuals were justly rewarded with Oscars for their work. Meanwhile, the sets & costumes were also top notch and helped to lend the film a feel of authenticity. Also worth mentioning is John Williams' Oscar-winning score.In the end, while ""Schindler's List"" shows exquisite care in every area it is ultimately the film's emotional impact that elevates it above the pack. It'd be a stoic individual indeed who isn't moved by this film in one way or another.","

"evanston_dad","10 February 2009","""Schindler's List"" was THE movie of 1993, and nothing came close to touching it in acclaim. It felt like the movie Steven Spielberg had been waiting years to make, and despite his previous efforts at making movies for grown ups (""The Color Purple""), this is the first movie that suggested he was maturing as a film maker.So does it hold up after all these years? Mostly. But is it a typical Spielberg movie? Most definitely. The first 3/4 of the film are compulsively watchable and entertaining, if you can consider brutal and graphic scenes of concentration camp violence entertaining. Spielberg uses a near-documentary style that fits the material perfectly, and using black and white with only occasional splashes of color feels like an inspired decision. But boy is that last quarter of the film schmaltzy, and has Spielberg's gooey fingerprints all over it. I don't know that something as horrific as the Holocaust needs a lot of emotional embellishment, but Spielberg just can't help himself.However, I forgive Spielberg in this particular case. This was obviously a story that meant a great deal to him, and I'm not sure it's fair to expect him to remain emotionally distant from it. He tells his story with a great deal of passion, and for the most part he tells it very well.Grade: A","

"neil-476","7 July 2011","Schindler's List comes about halfway in Spielberg's cinematic directing career (to date). It isn't his first (or his last) serious movie, but it is his best and, notwithstanding the enormous impact his entire output has had on the movie industry, I would go so far as to say it is the film he was born to make.Spielberg does the impossible, in a number of ways. He takes one of the most appalling periods of how vile man can be to his fellow man and, without losing any of the emotional and visceral impact of that inhumanity, wrings something inspirational and human out of it - we watch fascinated, moved, devastated, and - if we are even halfway human ourselves - improved by the experience of watching the story unfold.This film is brilliant in so many ways, not least of which is the fact that the protagonists - Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes' Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern - are no one-dimensional caricatures, created for the single purpose of delivering plot developments. No, they - and all the characters in this wonderful, harrowing film - are real people, neither all good nor all bad.Watch it to see a truly gifted director exercising his art at the very top of his game, not that Spielberg has ever been anywhere else.","

"dy158","21 March 2011","1939 Poland. Polish Jews from around the country were being relocated to the Krakow Ghetto. Meanwhile, ethnic German businessman Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) had also arrived at the Krakow Ghetto, hoping to make a fortune as a war profiteer.Bribing high-ranking officials to build a factory for the production of army mess kits, having a Polish Jew in Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) who is an official from the Krakow's Jewish Council as his accountant and administrator in his factory. Stern would also be credited for typing the list of names eventually famously known as Schindler's list, the Jews who would come to survive the Holocaust because of his boss Oskar Schindler. Schindler had originally hired Polish Jews instead of Polish Catholics because of cheap labour, but he soon realises the horror of what some of his workers were going through. It is in view of SS Lieutenant Amon Göth (Ralph Finnes), who at the concentration camp, oversaw the massacre (which eventually came to be known as the Operation Reinhard in Kraków) where those who were protesting or appeared uncooperative were to be shot.Oskar Schindler who saw what was going on from the hills overlooking the area with his mistress, become increasingly affected by those whom he call 'his' workers. Mindful of his friendship with Göth, Schindler brides him to build a sub-camp for his workers in order to prevent any more random execution.There is a reason why Oskar Schindler will always be celebrated for what he did for the Jews he had managed to save during the Second World War, despite the various faults he had as a person. Acclaimed film director Steven Spielberg, who based the film on the novel 'Schindler's Ark' written by Australian novelist Thomas Keneally (which the inspiration for the work in Poldek Pfefferberg, who is one of the many Schindler Jews was the one who decided to bring the story of Oskar Schindler to the wider audience), has make the film such that we are being transported back to the actual war years itself with the black-and-white images. That is with the exception of the opening sequence and what happens after the war ended where it is in colour.Liam Neeson played well in his role of Schindler, while Ralph Finnes perfected the role of SS Lieutenant Amon Göth, to the extent it was rather convincingly that it could be really Göth himself.While it is a film depicting the horrors of the war and how one ethnic German decided to go all out to save as much as he could despite his Nazi connections, it is also a film which is still relevant in the times we are living in apart from the fact that the Holocaust denial is still alive in certain quarters and neo-Nazism has not really gone away.","

"OllieSuave-007","8 September 2015","This movie is difficult to watch as it, in detail, expresses the sheer horror and grisliness of the Holocaust. From the forced relocation of the Jews toward the ghettos to the terrors of Auschwitz, the persecution of the Jews is a centerpiece of this film and it will resonate in your mind long after this movie is over. This movie also centers around the life of Oskar Schindler, played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, as a money-hungry German businessman who employs Jews to work in his factory, but ultimately grows concerned for the well-being of the Jews as he witnesses their merciless persecution by the Nazis. His mission in turning his factory into a salvation for the Jews throughout WWII becomes a driving force for the plot and builds up the suspense and tension, making you eager to find out what the aftermath is by the film's end.Ben Kingsley gave a great performance of Itzhak Stern, the Jew who ends up being Schindler's trusted assistant and right-hand man, and Ralph Fiennes gave a haunting portrayal of the evil and sadistic Amon Goeth - an ultimate villain you would love to hate. And, all the supporting actors and extras who portrayed the Jews gave a heartfelt performance; even as actors, you really sympathize with them as they gave such a realistic and heart wrenching portrayal.Janusz Kaminski did a good job on the cinematography, capturing the aura and tension of World War II; John Williams gave a stirring music score with a beautiful violin solo by Izak Perlman; and Steven Spielberg did a nice job directing a well-paced film.It's true that some people criticizes the accuracy and historical facts of the film and the overly intensiveness of the plot elements, but, it is no doubt an impactful film about the Holocaust and the courageous deeds of a man who sought to save many.Grade B+","

"ToldYaSo","3 August 1999","I don't have to tell you that ""Schindler's List"" is an extraordinary and important film. Unanimous praise and celebration of a multi-award winning cinematic masterpiece should make it abundantly clear what a powerful film it is. To say nothing of Steven Spielberg's remarkable achievement of delivering in the same year the greatest box office hit to date with ""Jurassic Park"" and then the Academy's best picture and director Oscars. But everyone knows about that already.I saw this film at a second run cinema in my neighbourhood, which basically sold out each show of ""Schindler's List"" for the week it was running. When my wife and I entered the theater, there seemed to be only one pair of seats available in the whole place. Only after we sat down did we notice the guy in front of us was proudly brandishing a tall cowboy hat. We figured out quite quickly why our seats were available and thought we ought to explore our options. I very politely leaned forward and asked him if he was going to wear the hat during the show. With a friendly smile, the kind man in his mid-thirties assured us he'd remove it when the picture began. True to his word, he took off the hat when the lights went out. Rarely have I ever seen a theater audience so transfixed on the images before them. Complete devotion of attention from every patron. Except one. When the ""dude"" in front of us grew tired of the film, some twenty minutes into it, he attempted making out with his girlfriend who briefly complied but ultimately succeeded in pushing him away. A number of future attempts were met with decreasing levels of success. Clearly the subject matter on screen was far from romantic.Weeks later, art imitated life on an episode of ""Seinfeld"" when Jerry's friends and family are outraged at his similar behavior which was a result of having no privacy while his parents stayed with him.Back to our friend ""Howdy Doody"", who has failed in his amorous advances during a film about one of the most chilling, harrowing subjects in the history of mankind. When his attention span gave out, and I imagine some five year olds could put him to shame, he rested his head on the back of the seat and stared at the ceiling. He would periodically sigh loudly, a declaration of his utter boredom. Not surprisingly, he drifted away and soon began to snore.I did nothing of course, and resigned myself to the fact that I'd have to watch the film again. This unfortunate sort of thing is the downside of seeing films in the theater, which I am by and large a huge supporter of in general. You never know what ""Buckaroo"" you might be sitting behind, but my advice to you is simple. If you ever spot a cowboy hat, relocate.","

"sddavis63","3 August 2009","This movie must be the best piece of work dealing with the Holocaust that I have ever seen. The only criticism I can find myself making of it is that it was a little bit confusing in the first hour or so, but even that was probably appropriate as the movie portrays a time of chaos anyway. The first thing that one notices is the decision to film the movie in black and white. That was a brilliant decision. Somehow, it gives the story greater power. The brutality of the Holocaust is obvious, the sadistic nature of the SS is portrayed brilliantly, both in depictions of actual events and by Ralph Fiennes in his portrayal of SS officer Amon Goeth, the confusion and uncertainty and desperation of the Jews is palpable. Everything is raw with power. I would have liked some greater explanation of the impact of the little girl who provides the only splashes of colour in the movie (she's dressed in red) on Schindler. She's hardly the only child he sees suffer. Why her in particular?Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Itzhak Stern, the Jewish accountant recruited by Schindler to run his business is appropriately low-key. Here was a man who saw an opportunity to help his fellow Jews through Schindler's company and who quietly took advantage of it. Which brings me to Liam Neeson's portrayal of Schindler. He did a great job - completely believable as he portrays Schindler's evolution from a businessman who just wanted to make money and who brought Jews into his factory for no reason except that they were the cheapest labour available to a man determined to protect his Jewish workers from the insanity and horror of Auschwitz. The closing scene, as he breaks down crying out that he feels he should have saved more people, is one of the most powerful and moving scenes I have ever seen in a movie, especially as Stern quietly comforts him and says ""no - you did so much"" and the other Jews he saved rush up to embrace and comfort him. It was also moving to see the Schindler Jews honouring his grave at the end of the movie. Schindler provides the inspiration here. Yes, it's inspiring that he saved 1200 Jews, but the inspiration goes beyond that. As the story makes clear, Schindler was largely a failure at everything he did in life, both before and after the war. And yet, this man - who was (I hate to use the word, but it's pretty much true) a loser - managed to rise to what must have seemed an insurmountable challenge and accomplished something great of historic proportions. If a man like Schindler could do this, surely others can do it too - not with respect to the Holocaust anymore (thank God!) but with some of the other issues in the world today. This is truly a brilliant piece of work. 9/10","

"Jonathon_Natsis","13 March 2013","Schindler's List is the kind of once-in-a-generation film that comes along and earns truly universal acclaim. The tale of Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party who saves well over one thousand Jews during the Holocaust through his cunning and selflessness, is a timeless exhibition of exactly why the very medium of filmmaking was invented. Approaching its 20th anniversary, Universal Sony has converted the original film into high-definition, allowing a new generation to experience its soaring story and visceral intensity.Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a man who considers himself a businessman first and a Nazi second. In the throes of WWII, he sees opportunity in hiring Jewish POWs to work in his enamel factory. With the help of trustworthy accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), he develops a godly reputation among the Jews despite originally being apathetic to their struggles. Naturally, his actions raise the curiosity of some high-ranking German officers, including the sadistic Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes).The legacy of Schindler's List stands tall two decades after its theatrical release. The film took home seven Oscars at the 1994 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay, while Neeson and Fiennes were bested in the Acting categories by Tom Hanks (Philadelphia) and Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive) respectively. Today, Schindler and Goeth are considered arguably the finest moments of either man's distinguished career. The Blu-ray conversion is virtually faultless at every turn. It is one thing to infuse a visual sense of wonder to a screen already populated by giant sharks, prehistoric beasts or cuddly other-worlders; it is quite another to invoke that same awe to a sombre tale filmed in monochrome, but that is precisely what has been achieved with this restoration. The update beautifully renders some of the most harrowing shots ever put to celluloid, including the massacre set to Bach and the first glimpse of Auschwitz; its steaming, monstrous pillars resembling a most ironic monolith of human evolution. The famous Girl in Red- for many, the emotive highlight of the film- is given new and ironic life through touched-up footage keeping her dress from fading into its surroundings, as was the case with the original negative.For such a powerful piece of cinema, the mastery of Spielberg's direction is his ability to peel back as opposed to going for the jugular too early or too often. The film expertly traverses a near-impossible pitfall of melodrama. As he did with more contemporary histo-drama Lincoln, Spielberg's ability to blend the emotionally challenging and the humanistic is unmatched, in what remains not only his most personal project, but perhaps the most personal film of any A-list director ever.The end result is still a depressing and, at times, highly disturbing piece of art, but one that concurrently remains an absorbing character study of the highest order. Schindler is not a wholeheartedly compassionate man; for him, it's all about the Benjamins- or in this case, the Reichsmarks- and he is offended- nay, enraged- that his workers would have the audacity to call his factory a 'haven', until his perspective on the war is forever changed. Likewise, Goeth, the man who kills Jews from his balcony with the same indifference as a man reading the morning paper, is the same one that secretly lusts after his Jewish maid. Kingsley's Stern, then, just may be the most emotionally integral character, acting as the catalyst for Schindler's eventual change of heart while playing the role of the unshakeable moral compass and most accessible window for the audience into the lives of those persecuted. It is this story of flawed good versus flawed evil that humanises these once mythical creatures. Appropriately, it isn't until the final half-hour that the immensity of their actions are realised in one of the most memorable, heartfelt endings of all time, in which Spielberg breaks every rule of conventional narrative filmmaking at once in order to pay his final respects. The Blu-ray comes complete with a series of special features, including Voices from the List, a documentary featuring testimonies from some of the 'Schindler Jews' who survived the Holocaust, as well as a story on Spielberg's USC Shoah Foundation. The intentions of Universal are salient here, as their features keep in line with the director's original intent to minimise publicity or self-servitude, to the point where he even refused payment for his work, citing 'blood money' as the deterrent. However, trivia buffs interested in some of the more allegorical tidbits of production (including the alleviation of on-set depression through Spielberg's screenings of Seinfeld and Robin Williams sketches, and the time a survivor trembled with terror at her first sight of Fiennes because he reminded her too much of the real Goeth) may be satiated by a 16-page companion booklet, featuring behind- the-scenes information on the incredible stories around an incredible composition.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.

"filipemanuelneto","8 September 2015","This film tells the story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Polish industrialist who collaborated with the German war effort, after the invasion of his country, by keeping working in his plant many Jewish prisoners. Aware that keep them working was to save their lives, Schindler hires as much as he can, going against his own interests and even raising suspicions among the Nazis. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film also has the participation of Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes. Based on a true story, the film screenplay is from Steven Zaillian.There are some movies that are so good and symbolic that ultimately overcome the art of cinema itself and become part of the heritage and memory of Humanity. This is one of those movies. There isn't any negative note to do: the cast exceeded expectations, the script is excellent, the costumes and scenarios are historically accurate. The cinematography deserves special positive note, with interesting camera angles and a very clever use of black and white. In recognition of this merit, the film won seven Oscars (best film, best director, best adapted screenplay, best cinematography, best art direction, best editing and best original soundtrack) and was nominated for another five statuettes (Best Actor, Best supporting actor, best costume, best sound and best characterization).The story told in this film is the living testimony of a sad page in world history, but that doesn't end in the past. The Holocaust ended decades ago but there's still genocide and ethnic cleansing in other parts of the World. If this film brings a message of compassion and humanity, this isn't only for some people, but transcends the issue of Jews or Germans to reach all those in this World are persecuted for their faith, ethnic or other perverse motivations.","

"Red_Identity","2 July 2008","Well, first of all, this is not my usual type of film. I don't like watching such realistic films, since they really depress me. But since this is a universally acclaimed Oscar-winner, I decided to see it.This is a very realistic film. It deplicits the horror that Polish Jews went through, and I have never seen a film with such power. The film, I was glad, did not start off suddenly with the Jews, and throughout the film, we are able to look into characters' emotions and minds. A lot of character are seen in this film, and they are given development, so we can actually care about them. There were a lot of actors involved in this film, and the main actors, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley, all do great jobs. They each make their characters unique. They each give their whole into it.The film has a lot to deal with. It really is a 'grand' film. The productions and the cost of all the actors and stunts must have been hard. In those scenes, scenes that we are able to see how disturbing Jews lived, those scenes are amazing. There are a lot of powerful ones, and we can surely distinguish them. The cinematography is simply amazing. Some of the best I have ever seen, the use of the camera, and the pacing etc. This is a very technical achievement as well. It really did look like we were witnessing real persons being tortured.Overall, this is simply a masterpiece. Yes, I thought it was a bit long. I actually felt a little restless in parts, and sort of dull, but I still recognized the achievement, and although I couldn't really follow in all the dialogue, I still appreciated it. That is what a masterpiece is. A work or art, a work of realism to give the audience. Everyone should see this film. You cannot help but feel a little distraught for all these people. The ending scene, with the actors walking with their real-life character portrayals, was simply emotional. It really gets to you. It is simply Steven Spielberg's greatest work he ever made.","

"thesouthfamily2-552-707097","15 January 2014","""Schindler's List"" is described as a film about the Holocaust, but the Holocaust supplies the field for the story, rather than the subject. The film is really two parallel character studies--one of a con man, the other of a psychopath. Oskar Schindler, who swindles the Third Reich, and Amon Goeth, who represents its pure evil, are men created by the opportunities of war.In telling their stories, Steven Spielberg found a way to approach the Holocaust, which is a subject too vast and tragic to be encompassed in any reasonable way by fiction. In the ruins of the saddest story of the century, he found, not a happy ending, but at least one affirming that resistance to evil is possible and can succeed. In the face of the Nazi charnel houses, it is a statement that has to be made, or we sink into despair.The film's ending brings me to tears. At the end of the war, Schindler's Jews are in a strange land--stranded, but alive. A member of the liberating Russian forces asks them, ""Isn't a town over there?"" and they walk off toward the horizon. The next shot fades from black and white into color. At first we think it may be a continuation of the previous action, until we see that the men and women on the crest of the hill are dressed differently now. And then it strikes us, with the force of a blow: Those are Schindler's Jews. We are looking at the actual survivors and their children as they visit Oskar Schindler's grave. The movie began with a list of Jews being confined to the ghetto. It ends with a list of some who were saved. The list is an absolute good. The list is life.What is most amazing about this film is how completely Spielberg serves his story. The movie is brilliantly acted, written, directed and seen. Individual scenes are masterpieces of art direction, cinematography, special effects, crowd control. Yet Spielberg, the stylist whose films often have gloried in shots we are intended to notice and remember, disappears into his work.","

It's almost impossible for me to be choked up in a movie. What made this film even more powerful than the content is that it was filmed in black and white. It had a powerful effect on me and most other viewers.This movie is about the transformation of a war profiteer and how he goes from a self-centered businessman to a rescuer of Jews during the second world war.The acting is unbelievable. I thought Liam Neeson was okay in the first ten minutes then he really brought his acting skills to another level after that. Ralph Fiennes was great. It was very easy to hate his character.Steven Spielberg is a marvelous director. All of his movies I seen were great ones and this may be his best. John Williams provided a mesmerizing score that will haunt my mind for a long time.Overall, this is a emotional movie. This makes me hate Hitler and his SS pigs even more for what they did to these poor people. I rate this film 10/10.","

"jaddison383","12 December 2007","This is a film that will be remembered forever. There's not many films that can boast that, but this film definitely can. It is truly one of the greatest films ever made.Oskar Schindler started off the same as most of the men of his Nazi party: He loved women, good wine, and making money. He started a factory in the middle of the war and made money using Jewish slaves as workers. He sold parts to Nazi armies, eventually becoming one of the nation's wealthiest men. As he began to be invited into the inner circle of the Nazi's, though, he began to see the horrors of what was really going on; He began to see the horror of himself. And he began to try to save the Jews.Shot in stark black and white with rare glimpses of color, Schindler's List is a true masterpiece. Steven Spielberg completely recreates what is one of the darkest times in human history with startling reality and shows a new generation exactly how terrible it was. At the same time an uplifting story, a horror film, and a dramatic saga, Schindler's List will forever change you. It is a not a lighthearted film to be enjoyed on a Sunday afternoon- it may disturb you. But it is a must-see for everyone so that we can better understand what really happened in that terrible war. Superb film-making is all around in this film. A must see! 10/10 stars! Jay Addison","

"MattyGibbs","30 December 2012","This is simply one of the best films ever made. It is heartbreaking, depressing and uplifting in equal measure. The story itself is simple but beautifully realised and the acting is incredible. Liam Neeson, Ralf Fiennes and Ben Kingsley are all magnificent but there is not a duff performance throughout this film. This is a long film but it never gets boring and there are memorable scenes throughout. I am not a big fan of Steven Spielberg but it is difficult to see how this film could have been bettered by any director. This film stands as a brutal reminder of the horrors of war but also the incredible bravery and compassion of a few men.","

I bought this film after seeing it, that's how good it was.","

"didi-5","25 January 2005","The story of Oskar Schindler, adapted from Thomas Keneallay's book 'Schindler's Ark', was brought to the screen by Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson gives a strong and powerful performance in the lead role, bringing a dignity and gravitas to the man who saved the people on his list from certain death at the hands of the Nazis.The film is in black and white, with the exception of the red dress of a small girl we follow in the Jewish ghetto, and a real-life coda at the end where the people saved by Schindler pay their respects to him. Was Schindler a great man, a humanitarian, or motivated by gain and greed? The film seems firmly in the first camp and in its other characters portrays certain stereotypes - the sensitive Jew played by Ben Kingsley, the sadistic SS man played by Ralph Fiennes.It doesn't flinch from showing the worst of the Holocaust, and rightly so. But - as the story unfolds and the small amount of people on the list are saved - there is hope within the unspeakable terrors of anti-Semitic propaganda. Along with 'The Color Purple', this is Spielberg's strongest work.","

"ChristianUnchained","23 April 2013","This is one of the most challenging films to review. Not because it's complex or difficult to follow, but because it is quite simply one of the most intense films I have ever seen and the level of emotion is...quite unlike most movies of today. Widely considered Steven Spielberg's crowning achievement, Schindler's List is a powerful, utterly devastating and raw glimpse at the horrors of the Holocaust. It's also a profound character epic, transforming a man who prides himself on leisure and his bountiful fortune into one who sacrifices it all to save the lives of many.The first element of note is the phenomenal cast. Liam Neeson leads as Oskar Schindler, and is tremendous. A real, raw, and emotional performance. Ben Kingsley plays Itzhak Stern, a troubled Jewish accountant who helps Schindler in his character transformation. His performance is also incredibly genuine, ever representing some of the best casting in film. Rounding out the fantastic cast is Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, a sadistic psychopath with nothing but hate for the Jewish people. It's an awesome cast that carries emotional weight and intensity, but written with that signature Spielbergian style. Right off the bat, you can also see the Schindler's List is in black and white. This visual style is striking and refreshing and adjusting to it is remarkably easy. The way the film is shot is more intimate and personal as compared to other Spielberg outings, and the black and white really augments the experience. The sets are recreated with such incredible attention to detail; Everything from the Ghetto at Krakow to the terribly disturbing Auschwitz, Spielberg simply doesn't take you to these places but puts you in them, creating a sense of tangible immersion in these places. John Williams also composed the score for Shindler's List, and is among one of his most original works to date. Straying away from the big and boisterous action packed scores he usually composes, the score for Schindler's List is a more subtle and emotional score, and I was taken away by the beautiful music (the theme is especially memorable).Being a Holocaust film, Schindler's List has no shortage of intense grit and violence. It's worthy of note because of the brutality of it all, recreating some of the darkest moments of human history with nothing held back. I cried more than a few times during Schindler's List because of these scenes; it's so emotionally poignant and it gets the point across with almost blistering intensity, and if not for the transformation of Schindler the entire film would fall apart. But because of the striking visuals, intimate and strong performances, and that Spielbrgian branded style, Schindler's List shines as a near-perfect balance between intense violence and story.I will say that Schindler's initial transformation seems rather sudden, but when between the rock and the hard place that Oskar Shindler was in I can see his change of heart. Other than this seemingly dramatic change of character, This film is a masterpiece. It's all just so incredibly disturbing, powerful, emotional, intense, and violent that Schindler's List becomes ingrained into your mind. And that's a good thing. While all films that win Best Picture are credible in their own right, I can safely say that Schindler's List rises above most for one simple reason: Schindler's List is an important film. In a time when people are denying the Holocaust even happened (for some foolish reason), Schindler's List is a graphic and raw recreation of an event in history that should never be forgotten. Brilliantly casted, well conceived, directed, shot and tremendously powerful Schindler's List is a masterpiece film that, now in 2013, has stood the test of time and will undoubtedly remain a classic for ages to come.Blu-Ray Review: Picture quality is surprisingly good, with only one or two moments with obvious visual flaw. The audio is as good as it can be. It isn't laser sharp, but isn't distracting either. In terms of a remaster it's awesome. The packaging is in a nice collectable box, and a 3 disc set (2 DVD's - parts 1&2) and 1 Blu-Ray. Digital Copy included is both iTunes (gladly it's HD) and UV.","

"White Dolphin","14 January 2001","How people can call this movie 'horrible' or rate it with 1 star is really beyond me. If ever a movie has captured the cruelty and inhumanity of the holocaust this is it. Horrifying scenes such as a woman being shot to death for construction mistakes that weren't her fault, a man taken out to be killed but the gun won't fire and has to hear the officer try to see what the problem is so that he can shoot. And so many many more scenes that will stay in your mind for a long long time.I didn't cry in this movie. I haven't cried in a movie since I was a kid. But this movie had a huge impact on me that when I went to sleep the night I saw this movie the images kept rolling in my mind (quite like the impact the botched execution scene in The Green Mile had on me).I saw a review before me (a few pages back) which said that Israeli people are probably the most aware about the Holocaust. But I don't believe that's true. At least not to the younger generation. One of the huge mistake people make (including many many Israelis) is that the Holocaust was only against Jews. I personally find it a disgrace that the Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel and the famed Holocaust Museum in Israel ""Yad Va Shem"" refer only to the figure 6,000,000. When over 11,000,000 people fell victim to the crimes of the Nazis. But hey I'm rambling here. I think this movie definitely captures the torture that the Holocaust victims had to go through.The movie is in black and white, with only one girl in a red dress who is shown trying to save her life from the Nazis by hiding under a bed. We later see this same girl's body taken to be burned- showing us that she obviously didn't survive. That got to me most. I don't think much of Steven Spielberg as a person. In fact I don't even think that much of him as a director but he did a magnificent job on this movie. I'm, sure that it will become one of the most well remembered movies of all time. People know the figures, the numbers, the years but to see it for yourself just makes you feel so happy that you were not a Jew/Gypsy/Black/Homosexual/Deformed/Handicaped/Left-Handed/Communist, etc. at that time. I think everyone should see this movie.
Although I think it is the most powerful movie ever made, and deserves the number one spot on the IMDb top 250 (over The Godfather, and The Shawshank Redemption) it's not a movie I would see multiple times. Perhaps once a year when it's shown on Holocaust Memorial Day, and even that can be to much. It's the type of movie that it's enough to see once and sticks in your mind. 10/10.","

"Cocacolaguy912-2","9 July 2007","This film, along with Amistad and perhaps a few others, show that Steven Spielberg is not just a cutesy, non-brutal, gentle director as some of his films make him out to be. This film is not cliché or heartwarming. The truth is that if you are going to make a film about something as horrifying and terrible as The Holocaust, you have to be brutal. And Spielberg was necessarily brutal. What's depicted in this film is extremely upsetting, and I wish not go into detail fear I upset myself and furthermore upset you. It's not gory or bloody like a war film, (although there are some scenes that boarder on gory), but rather, as you may have guessed, emotionally brutal. I am not a Jewish individual, but I can honestly say, just as a human being, this film upsets me. Schindler's List is extremely well made, with excellent performances, and shot in black and white which I felt set the bitter, old tone.This is not for the faint of heart, but certainly a very essential, moving film.One a final note, a praise Spielberg for two things. One would be for making this film for absolutely no money, and also for not turning it into a ""German hate"" movie.","

"BadWebDiver","7 March 2002","I rank this as THE best drama story ever. When it got released, I was chatting with a co-worker in the staff room who said: ""I know I should see this movie, but I don't think I could handle sitting through two hours of watching people suffer in the concentration camps."" and I totally agreed. If only we'd realized how great this film tells its story.I think a scene that best demonstrates this film is the Train Rescue scene. I can just imagine a lesser production putting a heavy-handed sentimental moralistic sob speech right in the middle of it (which would have turned Oskar into a very quick martyr for sure). Instead, the characters are trying to cope with the immediate concerns of the situation. They're almost in a state of self-denial about the implications of what's going on; and it's left to the unspoken sequence at the end to bring home the emotional impact. As Alfred Hitchcock said: ""A good filmmaker doesn't tell you something, he shows you something"".Another aspect that makes this film work, and one I don't think gets acknowledged too much, is it's effective use of dark humor. Examples include the Chicken Thief scene, and Oskar negotiating with the Aucshwitz Commandant. (I also reckon the sequence where Goeth tries out Oskar's ""benevolence is power"" idea, and decides it doesn't work is humorous - but that may be just me!). This film almost has the personality of a Hogan's Heroes episode - and I mean that as a sincere complement.It reminds me of a Yiddish joke I heard about a Nazi sympathizer and a Jewish businessman who bump into each other on a street corner at the start of WW2. The Nazi sympathizer snaps ""Schweinhund!!!' and stalks off in a huff. The Jewish businessman brushes himself off, tips his hat, and murmurs; ""And **I'm** Goldberg.""But the thing that really makes this film work is the fact that is plays on the viewer's expectations. The film is made for people who have seen WW2 documentaries, and think they know what happened. The prime example is the shower scene (which I think is more psychological than PSYCHO). This film works because it doesn't preach at you, it plays the situations and asks you to respond to them. And I think that's the secret of great storytelling.","

"MaxBorg89","7 December 2005","Prior to making Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg was known for Close Ecounters, E.T. and the Indiana Jones films - not exactly the kind of resumé studios would trust when searching for the ideal guy to direct a Holocaust drama. Then again, Scorsese passed on the project because he felt only a Jewish filmmaker could get it right (plus, he was still recovering from the controversy surrounding The Last Temptation of Christ), Billy Wilder said he was too old (but he did contribute to a first draft of the screenplay) and Roman Polanski stated he just wasn't ready to face his childhood nightmares yet (he did nine years later with The Pianist). Spielberg received a lot of criticism before the film was released, purely because of his back catalogue. Of course, it is now a fact he proved everyone wrong with what can be considered the best, most affecting of his serious movies.Based on Thomas Keneally's bestseller (deftly adapted by Steven Zaillian), the film tells one of the most amazing true stories of our time, one that stands out as a testament to courage and selflessness in a time as brutal and inhuman as World War II. The story is that of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who first came across the ""Jewish situation"" in Hitler's Germany when he decided to employ Jews in his factory in order to save money. He wasn't an outspoken anti-Semite, nor did he oppose the Nazi regime - to him, it was all about business. Case in point: when he first meets his new assistant (Ben Kingsley) and the latter says he's a Jew, Schindler's matter-of-fact answer is: ""And I'm a German."".The famous list doesn't enter the game until much later, when the cynical businessman witnesses the horrors perpetrated by the SS, particularly the stunningly cruel Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), and decides to use all his power and influence to save as many innocent lives as possible. His actions, which could have cost him his life had he been discovered, will go down in history as one of the most extraordinary events of all time.If told the wrong way, Schindler's story would have ruined Spielberg's career. Luckily, the director made the wisest choice possible, opting for a documentary-like approach to the material: the film is shot in grainy black-and-white, as if it were a newsreel from that period, and the realism is most evident in the concentration camp scenes - Spielberg doesn't linger on the violence or sanitize it, he just shows it exactly as it was. The one element in color in the whole picture (a girl's red dress, reminiscent of Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now) isn't a concession to the somewhat cheesy sentimentality that is occasionally present in Spielberg's filmography, but a tool to highlight the tragedy of it all. The sobriety of the direction is reflected in every other aspect of the picture, most notably John Williams' Oscar-winning score and the three main performances: Kingsley's talent was never in doubt after Gandhi, and Neeson and Fiennes will probably never do better than here (although both have managed to get pretty close, thankfully).This painfully real film is a precious means to remember the past and think thoroughly about one of the worst things that ever happened to people, an atrocity mankind hopefully won't repeat, not even in a thousand years. It's a look on the past that serves as a warning for the future, and as such, its power will never diminish.","

"AmyJenson1995","22 January 2017","The Holocaust has been one of the most awful and tragic event of the History of humanity. It will always remain a stain in our legacy, a true proof of how despicable and monstrous we, the human race, can be.That's the main reason why the Schindler's List should be praised. It goes far beyond the cast, the awards, the revenue it produced. This movie has been made so we cannot forget and repeat the same atrocities. While more and more survivors of this tragedy are passing away, taking with them their testimonies and there are still people who dare ignoring that those events truly happened, The Schindler's list and its message will always remain for everyone to see.So I won't review the movie like a simple piece of art. Sure Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes or Ben Kingsley are awesome in that movie and they sure each should have received a so well deserved award for their performance but that's not the most important. The only fact that they are part of this movie should make them proud. If through it, they could help prevent that such horrible tragedies like the Holocaust happen again and save millions of lives in the process, it's definitely worthier than any Oscar or Golden Globe on your shelves! So thank you Steven, Liam, Ralph, Ben and everyone who made this movie a reality. Let your message be spread and shared from generations to generations. So we could never forget and say never again!","

"neal-57","8 July 2006","Despite Thomas Keneally's excellent book and Steven Spielberg's awe-inspiring film, many people still avoid the story of Oskar Schindler and his famous ""list,"" because they fear reading about, or watching, the Holocaust. They shouldn't, though, because this is a story where the ""good guys"" win--German industrialist Schindler and the more than 11,OOO Jewish workers he kept safe in his Brinnlitz, Czechoslovakia factory, while their brethren were being systematically slaughtered all around.A number of viewers find it difficult to accept that the film is liberally laced with humor. But why shouldn't it be? Humor is one of the most effective weapons with which man on earth is armed, and, for the oppressed, humor can literally mean the difference between survival and destruction.Some of the more humorous moments in ""Schindler's List"" include: ...The scene in which Poldek Pfefferberg (for those who haven't noticed, the same Pfefferberg who, as an older man, first told the Schindler story to author Thomas Keneally) and his fellow black marketeers are arguing about the quality of the merchandise: ""That's not my problem,"" ""That's not his problem,"" et cetera....The scene in which Wilhelm Nussbaum and his family have been thrown out of their luxurious home and relocated in a ghetto hovel: his wife remarks ""It could be worse,"" Nussbaum thunders ""HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY BE WORSE?!?"" and then, as the OTHER new residents of these wretched quarters come filing in politely, he sees exactly how it can be worse....The scene in which Schindler holds auditions for a secretary: applicant after applicant is gorgeous but can't type for beans (hilariously, he shows one how to return the cartridge!)while the final candidate is a cigarette-smoking battle-ax who types with effortless efficiency--and in the next shot, he has hired them all! ...The scene in which Emily Schindler tells her husband that she'll stay with him in Krakow IF he can guarantee that no doorman or maitre d' will ever mistake her for a mistress, followed by an immediate cut to her departing on the train--the cut is so abrupt, it's almost slapstick....A similar scene in which Schindler is seeking permission to search a trainload of deportees for his manager Stern: he takes the names of the officer and the NCO who are blocking his way, assuring them that they will soon be serving on the Russian front, and CUT, the two Germans are shouting for Stern! ...The many scenes in which Oskar pours drinks for himself and the taciturn Stern, then ends up drinking them both--scenes which, of course, set up the poignant moment when Stern finally shares a drink with Schindler--just before Schindler makes his fateful decision to draw up the List.And, lest the viewer object to ""manufactured"" humor in a serious story, three scenes are taken verbatim from fact: ...The scene during the clearing of the ghetto when Poldek Pfefferberg is trapped by Goeth and his officers and salutes them, declaring that he has been ordered to clear the passageway. Goeth is so amused by the ""little Polish clicking soldier"" (Poldek had, in fact, been a Polish officer before that army was wiped out) that he allows him to live....The scene in which Goeth accuses Rabbi Levartov, the hinge-maker, of being a slacker, and drags him outside to shoot him, only to have not one, but TWO guns misfire, after which Goeth stalks off in disgust and the Rabbi is spared....The scene is which the women from the Schindler factory have been mistakenly sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Clara Sternberg is ready to give up and throw herself against the electrified fence. Mrs. Dresner tells her friend, ""Don't do it, Clara! You'll never know what happened to you!"" Again, a human life is saved.These scenes are sharp, and funny, and add immeasurably to the power of ""Schindler's List."" Such is the quality of this story that the viewer is compelled to IDENTIFY: with the hero, the victim, and, yes, even the villain.The hero, at first reluctant but later coming to embrace the role, is Schindler, played with avuncular warmth by Liam Neeson. The victim is embodied by Ben Kingsley as the Jewish accountant/manager Itshak Stern. Kingsley virtually ""becomes"" Stern, just as he ""became"" Mohandas Gandhi in that outstanding biopic. And finally, Ralph Fiennes is so incredibly effective as the villain, the sadistic Nazi commandant Amon Goeth, that he lingers in the viewer's memory much as the real Goeth haunted the dreams of his charges (and may still).When I first saw the film, I wondered why Spielberg had followed up the scene of a shirtless Goeth shooting prisoners at random from the balcony of his villa, with a scene of him walking to the toilet and urinating. Why, I wondered, did we have to watch the man taking a whiz? Then it came to me that the key word is that question is ""man."" Spielberg is graphically demonstrating that the Nazi commandant is NOT some demon from the depths, NOT some alien creature from another world, but a MAN. A man who has a pot belly, as so many of us do. A man who has to pee, as we all do. And a man who kills without compunction, AS WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF DOING.This may explain why so many, to this day, deny that the Holocaust ever occurred: they don't want to admit, they CANNOT admit, that they themselves are capable of such evil, so they desperately deny the truth they find so unacceptable.That's the true glory of Fiennes' performance: he reveals the beast that dwells in all of us, and must always be guarded against. Because the beast denied is not the beast vanquished. It merely waits, and watches, and observes the opportunity. It is always ready to emerge again, in any government, in any nation, in any people. Constant vigilance is required to empower the cry of the Holocaust survivors: NEVER AGAIN.","

"Coxer99","25 March 1999","An intense and moving motion picture that shocks, astounds and amazes in all of its 3 hours and 17 minutes. Liam Neeson is superb as Schindler, a womanizing bastard who profiteered off the sweat and tears of countless numbers of Jews at the start of the 1940's. As time went on, he saw the demise of the Jewish to Nazi rule and took a stand to save as many as he could. He ended up saving 1,100 Jews and he is considered, to this day, a savior. Neeson's transformation throughout the course of the film from Nazi supporter to Savior of the People is a poignant journey of soul searching. When you watch the piece, you may wonder, ""Is he changing because he's out of money? Does money truly matter at this point anymore? I think many would agree that Schindler had an awakening and that saving the people and himself was his destiny. He found peace with himself and with God. Steven Speilberg gives us a story that he has never imagined he could bring to us. He brings real life horror. A horror many people cannot confront as a survivor, let alone as an actor. Every actor should be commended for their courage in telling this important story. I am not Jewish, so all I can feel is sadness and sorrow for the tragedies that took place, but I cannot the anguish the countless families have felt for decades over the loss of parents, grandparents and children alike. With an intense screenplay from Stephen Zallian and cinematography and art direction that is the finest in years. Ralph Fiennes is outstanding as the Nazi soldier who treats Jews as cattle. The scene where he awakes, picks up a rifle and commences firing on a Jewish woman standing alone is true horror. Through the course of this film, I turned my head away countless times, not knowing what made people do what they do. Was their hope? Hope. That seems to be the key word in describing this movie. Hope is what Oskar Schindler gave 1,100 Jews. He gave them hope. He gave them life!","

"MovieGuy109","2 August 2011","Schindler's List was the first film by Steven Spielberg since Jaws I can genuinely call a masterpiece. Schindler's List is the highlight of the 90's, a touching look into humanism and a frightening look into the Holocaust. Filmed in Black and white (a very good decision from Spielberg) and as grand as Hollywood's most classic works, Schindler's List claims itself at the top of 90's filmmaking. All three leads are magnificent, especially Fiennes in his most well acted role yet. The depiction of the concentration camps is raw and gritty, not glazed over and stylized. A triumph for Steven Spielberg and the cast and crew. It is certainly the most impressive Spielberg film and perhaps the best film of the 1990's.","

"matlefebvre20","3 September 2006","For the last thirty years or so, Steven Spielberg has been the greatest star to shine in the film universe. He is already claimed as being the greatest filmmaker of all time even if he still have time to make other movies.And of all of these last thirty years, one of them must be especially highlighted: 1993. It's by far the greatest year of Spielberg's career. First, he broke the bank and revolutionized modern cinema with ""Jurassic Park"" which became (and still is) the most successful film of his career. It was the summer's highlight.And for Christmas, Spielberg came out with his crowning achievement: ""Schindler's List"". Based on a true story (yes, a TRUE story!), this extremely dramatic and ultra-realistic tale of a Nazi businessman who saved 1,100 Jews during Holocaust ultimately ended up with seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and a well-deserved Best Director Award for Mr. Spielberg.The first aspect of the movie that strikes the viewer is the filming process. ""Schindler's List"" is mostly shot in black and white, because it matched with Spielberg's ideas about World War II. He said that the only images that came to his mind when he thought about WWII were in black and white. Thereby, the movie brings a very adequate mood which is fueled by fear, sorrow and the most inhuman cruelties and dark feelings that are parts of this abominable war.But even if black and white is the most prominent filming process, colored parts appear in short, but crucial moments. The greatest example is the little girl with the red coat. She becomes the catalyst of Schindler's altruistic efforts. She is first spotted during the liquidation of Krakow's ghetto and then, Schindler sees her, unfortunately dead and about to be incinerated by the SS officers.The main force behind ""Schindler's List"" is the depiction of the Nazis' cruelties and racist gestures made to the Jews. And also the Jews' efforts in order to stand and flee from these absurd and inhuman moves. This idea is particularly shown in the ghetto's liquidation scenes which are the greatest, hardest and most harrowing pictures of the movie.""Schindler's List"" is also a success because of its three leading actors. Liam Neeson is Oskar Schindler, this Messiah-like figure who used his recently-made fortune in order to save his people. Neeson's performance is extraordinary and we can feel his inner transformation throughout the movie. He is perfectly depicted as a greedy man, but also as a restless seducer and womanizer. Ben Kingsley is Schindler's Jewish assistant Itzhak Stern and he delivers his greatest role apart from Gandhi in the eponymous movie. Finally, there's Ralph Fiennes' unforgettable performance as Untersturmfuhrer Amon Goeth who is the main representative of the Nazis' horrors and his attractive physique hides a wildly devilish nature, which fuels each one of his atrocities.Because it runs for about 200 minutes (three hours and twenty minutes), the movie includes several sub-plots which either highlight some passages of Thomas Keneally's novel or show other Holocaust-specific pictures, such as the 'selection' in Plaszow's camp.Out of all the movies made in the last decade of the 20th century, ""Schindler's List"" is probably the greatest, followed by Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"". This is only a 'probable', but some things are surer. For instance, this is undoubtedly Steven Spielberg's greatest picture, which is somehow ironic because Spielberg is known for his blockbusters and action-filled movies. So, it's ironic to see that such a war drama can be considered as Spielberg's definitive masterwork.But, in a sense, only Spielberg could have done a movie like this. He is a Jew himself and the Holocaust can only have more effect on him than any other filmmaker. Roman Polanski did well too with ""The Pianist"", but Spielberg's vision and direction were just superior. From now on, anyone could try to make a movie about the horrors of the Holocaust, but nobody will ever measure up to one of the most unforgettable true stories of the century: ""Schindler's List"".","

"Movie-ManDan","17 October 2014","Steven Spielberg is arguably the best film director ever. He may have done some bad movies, but his resume is chalkful of some of the most timeless things to every lay your eyes on. Enter Schindler's List: the true story of a crude nazi-party member (played here by Liam Neeson) that saved the lives of over a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. Spielberg outdoes himself using every trick up his sleeve and more, to the max. The movie is black and white to get an old feeling and the filming in general is dynamic and hauntingly real. So it is a feast for your eyes. The acting is uncanny with everything being character driven, which are the best movies to see. As a brutal Holocaust film, it is difficult to watch. As a movie about a bold hero, it is a major triumph. Many different emotions are felt at very high degrees, happy and sad. Very few movies made this well that can carry you through over 3 hours can make you truly sad and truly happy by the end as a major accomplishment. None of these few movies are Spielberg's. Yeah ET and Indiana Jones were masterpieces, but a funny-looking alien and an invincible archaeologist can't be taken as seriously and, simply, aren't quite as good. With the general movie-making being superior, its seriousness sets it apart from Spielberg's other classics. Because this is Spielberg's best, it is evident that this would be one of cinema's best in general. Top 20, heck, top 10! If somebody calls Schindler's List the best movie ever, I would not disagree.4/4","

"Digory","27 August 2012","1993 was a great year for Steven Spielberg. Just after the release Jurassic Park, he followed with Schindler's List. I'm not a huge sucker for biographical movies, preferring sci-fi and fictional in general but once in a while there are a few instance where biographical films catch my attention. It's been around for a while and I've heard great things about the movie, not to mention the awards and making it to movie lists. It was only until I found a copy of the film in a video store that I considered to finally watch it.As with biographical films, I was prepared for a slow-paced movie that might bore me. With a 3-hour running time, I felt it was going to exhaust me by the end of the movie. It was not the case, however.I've read of how bad the concentration camps are but how they are depicted in this film was far worse to how I imagined them. There's a sense of despair throughout the movie but Schindler's display of selflessness and humanity showed me the power of kindness in the midst of evil.Acting was great all throughout. I was fascinated with the black- and-white approach but I do understand that it was a way of making the violence a bit tolerable.Having seen it I can really say this is classic that deserves the praise it got. This movie showed me, on both extremes, the tendency of good and evil men. A powerful movie that should not be missed.","

"Oscar85","23 March 2000","To sum up Spielberg's masterwork in one word is a nearly impossible task, but I have come to the conclusion that Schindler's List is perfect. Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler is truly great in recreating the role of a modern day Moses. Making this film all the more compelling is John Williams' perfectly composed original musical score. This film deserves all the awards bestowed upon it, especially best picture by the National Board of Review and the Academy and the Academy Award for best director Steven Spielberg. It deserves all these awards and more. Schindler's List is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. Spielberg will remain an immortal filmmaker through the work he put into this film.","

"shikhargupta-05613","27 August 2017","You might not have heard about Oscar Schindler but you will definitely want to know more about him after watching the movie. He is credited with saving the lives of more than a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. He was named Righteous among the Nations by the Israeli Government a few years after the end of the Second World War. Righteous among the Nations is awarded to those non-Jews who helped Jews during the Holocaust in various ways such as providing them food or shelter, arranging escape out of Germany and German- occupied territories, etc.Schindler's List is based on a 1983 novel, Schindler's Ark. It tells the story of the efforts of Oscar Schindler, a German, to help Jews during the Holocaust. Played by Liam Neeson, Oscar is not an easy character to comprehend. It takes you time to fully understand who he is. He is a person who might come across selfish to you at first. He is an opportunistic businessman. He comes across as one who, even during the wartime, is trying to find opportunities to make money rather than worrying about people's lives. But deep inside, he has a heart bigger than the most and at a time when Jews were struggling to find a helping hand, he helped more than a thousand Jews. He is not a person who will give you sympathy for you are going to lose someone close, but he is one who would take actions to save your closed one and not tell you when he does. You can see this in the movie when a Jewish lady approaches him begging to get her parents out of the concentration camp and into his factory. At first, he not only denies her help but also lashes out at his assistant showing frustration how his for-profit factory has come to be known to people outside as a charitable harbor for Jews. But you can hear the pain he feels for that lady and all the other Jews in his frustrated voice. Later in the scene, the lady's parents are shown being escorted out of the concentration camp into his factory.The movie starts with how Oscar Schindler, in the midst of the Second World War, sets up a factory manufacturing pots and pans to supply to the German army. Oscar hires a Jewish accountant to manage the factory. While the account runs the factory enormously profitably for Schindler, he hires many Jews who would have otherwise ended up in concentration camps. By getting German SS guards to believe that they have the important skill sets required for the factory, he cleverly sneaks many Jews out of the concentration camps.As Oscar is setting up his factory, the German SS is brutally evicting all the Jews out of their houses and moving them to ghettos and later to labor camps. As Oscar and his wife helplessly watch eviction of a ghetto from a hill overlooking it, he realizes the dreadfulness of the war and that he needs to look beyond the factory profits and help the Jews. The atrocities that the Jews face will touch your heart. In a scene of a labor camp, as little children are being taken away by German SS guards from their mothers, a child runs away to hide. He tries a few places including outhouses but finding them occupied by other children, he dives through a toilet seat in a toilet pit to hide. The fear of life on the face of the little child as he settles in the toilet pit will bleed your heart.As the war progresses, the state of the Jews worsens. The SS plans to exterminate all the Jews and hence gradually starts moving them from labor camps to concentration camps. Oscar's pots and pans factory are not considered important enough for the war effort to continue employing the Jews anymore but he is determined to keep the Jews in his factory, by now called Schindler Jews, from the concentration camps as he devises a new plan.Despite the dark and sad story-line, the movie has many snippets of humour. As Oscar's manager is cleverly hiring Jews in the factory by keeping the SS in dark, he also hires an old man without a left arm as a metal polisher. The state of the old man is sad and the act of the manager is kind. But the subtle humour in the situation is difficult to miss when Oscar comes to know about the old man and frustratingly asks his manager how the old man is useful for the factory.Overall, Schindler's list is a heart-touching and a powerful movie that will force even a cold heart to warm for a moment. The movie is engaging and will keep you engaged for the entire three hours. It is a must-watch. I give it a rating of 9 out of 10.","

"MartianOctocretr5","27 September 2009","One of the finest productions ever put on film; also one of the most difficult films to watch that you will ever experience.It pulls no punches; therefore, it conveys just what a horrifying evil World War II's Nazi Germany really was. The reality of just what hatred and bigotry can influence one person to do to another is shown as ugly as it really is, and it's truly painful to see. The atrocities of this perverse dictatorship could easily be dismissed as a fluke of a violent era, but this film's underlying theme warns it could happen again.Spielberg outdid himself in this brilliant work. The hopelessness that must have been experienced by the victims of this vile time are captured so well on every level. The acting is superb: the psychotic Nazi colonel was a standout. Liam Neeson is memorable as the guilt ridden German businessman Schindler who endeavors to rescue political prisoners right out from under the Nazis' noses. The many Jewish people targeted and viciously abused in concentration camps are ably portrayed by the cast with strong conviction.Explicit scenes of ruthless killing and other abhorrent violence are not withheld, and this film is a rare case where such brutal honesty is appropriate and effective. There were scenes where I had to look away; I could almost feel the kick, the punch, the spit, the bullet. It was painful empathy for the terror of those in peril, and witnessing the many disgusting indignities they endured.It's a guarantee this is not a pleasant watch; some of the imagery may horrify you, especially with the realization that these things depicted actually took place. You will see the lowest and most detestable behavior by people imaginable, and it will stick with you. However, it is a necessary precautionary message. This was Spielberg's finest hour.","

"asticht","11 March 2004","When I first saw Schindlers list in the theater when it first came out, I was left stunned and emotionally drained. Now with the release of the film on DVD I am still in awe of the precision and accuracy that it portrays of the atrocities committed by the Nazi's during the second world war.  Stephen Spielbergs decision to make the movie entirely in black and white was pure genius and shows why he he is as successful of a director as he is.  This film is such a departure from other films that Spielberg has made and is a testament to his sincere embracing of the storyline and content of the story.  While this film is long by most standards, nearly twice as long as most contemporary films, it does not drag and keeps the audience rapt attention.  It is the type of film which comes along once in a great while which truly captures the imagination of the audience.  The subject matter makes this film one which one truly cannot express as an enjoyable film, but on a higher level it is insightful and inspires one to really see how one person can truly change the world, at least their part of the world.  Oskar Schindler was a scheming war profiteer who had no interest in any part of world politics, the winds of war were blowing in his direction and he took full advantage of it.  As the war progressed and he became a witness to the horrific acts committed by the Nazi's against the Jews he became to see the Jews in a different light to what the political propaganda was saying and he developed a conscience which ultimately led him to expend vast sums of money in bribes and political favors to protect his workers in his factory, initially under the guise of needing to keep trained workers in his factory to maintain production, but eventually because he could see how his workers people were being made to suffer and were being brutally murdered simply because of a misguided political doctrine.  Acting in this movie is superb, Lliam Neeson was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of Oskar Schindler and ultimately lost the award to Tom Hanks portrayal of a dying HIV positive lawyer in Philadelphia, this was truly one of those times when the Academy had a very difficult decision to make as both actors justifiably deserved the award.  Ralph Fiennes was nominated as best supporting actor for his role as the homicidal concentration camp Kommindant Amon Goeth, he ultimately lost the award to Tommy Lee Jones for his work in the Fugitive. Surprisingly one actor who did not receive a nomination, but should have would be Ben Kingsley who deservedly could easily have won the award for his portrayal of Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern who cooperated and assisted Oskar Schindler in running his Enamelware factory and ultimately used his intelligence to manipulate the system to encompass as many unskilled laborers as possible into Schindlers factory, persons who otherwise would have gone to the death camps as they were primarily musicians, writers and teachers, all who were considered high priority execution material by the Nazi regime.  This is a truly remarkable, emotional and moving film that will easily stand the test of time and remain a classic for years to come, it would be highly recommended and should be mandatory viewing material for all high school aged students who wish to graduate, as this film is not just a depiction of the events of World War II, but is also a reflection of the inner monster that lives within all mankind, hatred, and how there also lives within us a capacity to do great good for our fellow man.","

"IrisNo11","16 July 1999","""Schindler's List"" is one of the best movies of all time according to the people who write the reviews for this site, which isn't a big surprise.  I happen to be one of those people who voted 10, but some didn't enjoy it and I know a few people who wouldn't watch this movie, which is understandable due to what this film is about.This is a truly brilliant film, and I think it's the best film ever directed by Steven Speilberg.  It's powerful, it explains a lot, it has a solid cast. Liam Neeson gives a brilliant and Oscar-worthy performance (it's disappointing that he lost) as Mr. Schindler himself.  What I thought was interesting was how every bit of detail was explained and how the movie is black and white rather than color (which is a terrific idea if you ask me). There are a lot of interesting things about this movie, and that's number one reason why I loved ""Schindler's List"".  This movie never fails to amaze me!There is not one part in this film that I dislike.  I can't say anything bad about ""Schindler's List"".  If you see this movie, you might just be as impressed by it as much as I was! :o)","

"FrankBooth_DeLarge","20 December 2004","Schindler's list is a film that really handles the horrors of the holocaust, gives you a deep look at it, and almost makes you feel as though you're there with the characters. It is depressing as you see what people had to go through in the concentration camps.Two other excellent elements of the film are the fact that it has the best on screen hero ever, and one of the best on screen villains ever. The best on screen hero is Oscar Schindler because of how he sacrifices profitable business to save innocent people from the wrath of Hitler. One of the best on screen villain ever is Ralph Fiennes character. Ralph Fiennes character is one of the Nazis who has no heart and kills for sport. The key to having a good villain is having them be as heartless and horrible as possible. That's definitely what this character succeeds at.This film is excellent and will have an impact on you unlike any other. If you haven't seen it, see it now.","

"saadgkhan","4 June 2012","Schindler's List – CATCH IT (A+) Schindler's List is a 1993 film about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. (Wiki) Three hours long black & white movie is remarkable in itself. As the whole time you feel like you're in that time zone and not watching a movie but a history in told in the most brutal natural formal way. I was completely surprised when read on end credits that it's direct by Steven Spielberg. The director who mostly directs big fantasy movies from years. Liam Neeson portrayal of Oskar Schindler as the cunning but sweet hearted man is magnificent. This proves why this man is so well respected and maybe now he has moved to Action (decent) genre we all know what exactly he is capable of. Ralph Fiennes as egoistic Nazi is as despicable as despicable his actions were. In other words he was Incredible. Ben Kingsley is a legend. Overall, even though its 2012, when I finally saw this great Oscar winning movie it's totally worth your three hours.","

It is, undeniably, an extremely moving and powerful portrayal of the holocaust. The story is an incredible one and it is told beautifully in this film.'Schindler's List' is an intense watch from start to finish and is inevitably packed with emotion. There are some brilliant individual scenes - the slow motion shot of the girl in the red coat comes to mind as particularly powerful and a great piece of filmmaking, though there are many others.It isn't my personal favourite holocaust movie - The Pianist still holds that accolade, but 'Schindler's List' is still an excellent film and one of the top must-watch war films.","

"TheUnknown837-1","13 October 2007","While this is not my personal favorite out of all of Steven Spielberg's films, I do have a powerful appreciation for ""Schindler's List"" and I do credit it as the best Holocaust film ever made and probably Spielberg's third-best lifetime achievement and every time I watch some of the film's most graphic and heart-wrenching or even just plain disturbing sequences, I can understand the director's emotional weaknesses he had during filming of the project and he had every right to be so. I find it amazing that somebody who needed so much emotional assistance from friends and family could pull off a film with such amazing detail and craftsmanship. It just comes to show how much of a genius this man really is.""Schindler's List"" is a film that stretches at least close to, or even over, three hours in length. At times there are instances where I think maybe the film could have dealt with just one less conversation between stars Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) and Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), but once I get down to the last fifteen minutes of the film, I know it couldn't have been any shorter than it is. But ""Schindler's List"" is not just a film about displaying the unjustifiable tyranny and suffering caused during the Second World War, but it also explores the man who saved 1100 innocent lives: Oskar Schindler, who began caring about nothing but himself. Schindler as we first see him in the film, is married, yet he is a womanizer. He bends the law to profit during the war, he initially cares next to nothing about the Jewish people being tortured and shot by the Nazis. He's nothing more than a unsuccessful businessman who suddenly sees an opportunity to make a name and fortune for himself by benefiting from the suffering of others. And yet, as we go on later in the film and learn to understand him, the man is totally transformed, as indeed he was in real life. And he ends up giving everything he has and forced to lead the rest of his life alone and without success, to save the lives of over one thousand innocent Jewish people whose people were being tortured and killed just for being Jewish.While Oskar Schindler is definitely one of the greatest heroes...both on screen and in real life, Amon Goeth is undeniably one of the most horrifying villains of all time. Here, he is portrayed unbelievably convincingly by Ralph Fiennes. The character of Amon Goeth, as well as the entire Nazi party in the film, symbolize the vile cruelty that the biased Nazi party in real life would place upon their prisoners. We see a scene in the film, where they not only kill them for fun, but also make experiments out of their prisoners. Such as lining up a few men against a wall, sticking a rifle barrel to the stomach of the nearest one, and seeing how many of the men behind him the bullet will still strike. And then afterwards, walking up with a pistol and ruthlessly killing the survivors. Amon Goeth is even more terrifying, in some scenes, he shoots at workers for no apparent reason other than to kill time. And yet while the film explores the cruelty of Goeth, it also explores the other sides of him and how he could still be a friend and even a reasonable businessman who other Germans. The friendship that develops between him and Oskar Schindler never steers in a wrong direction, as one might expect, and they remain good friends throughout the entire film, despite their differences in outlooks upon the Jews.The music score, composed by masterful John Williams, is one of the finest scores ever composed for a film. Masterful films gets masterful music scores to go along with them and heighten the tension or drama or whatever is necessary for a scene. The opening scores of the film, as they mostly revolve around Schindler's first dives into success, are cheery and intriguing and later on, as the emotional parts begin to arrive, the soundtrack becomes heart-wrenching powerful and sad. The last fifteen minutes of the film are truly amazing and simply rips one's soul apart. And with William's amazing music in the background, you cannot ignore it or refuse to take it seriously.""Schindler's List"" is filmed almost entirely in black-and-white and it seems most appropriately that it is. I personally can not imagine what it could have seemed like in color. Well, maybe I can, but I cannot imagine it being as pure and artistic with color. It was meant to be black-and-white, because it was meant to be as much like a documentary as possible. And by using actors and actresses who are talented, yet mostly unknown names to the public, it brings more convincing appearances to the film.This is one of the greatest films ever made. And nobody else could have done it any better than Steven Spielberg himself. He did not live in a concentration camp or experience the suffering the Schindler Jews did, but he knows enough about it and brought his visions to the screen with absolute perfection. ""Schindler's List"" is a film that will never be forgotten and will probably never be overpowered by another Holocaust film in drama or purity.","

It is the traces of sentimentality that actually make it bearable - we watch the film not to relive the Holocaust, but to bear emotional witness to it.

"jarius","15 February 2002","We need more films like this, there can never be too many. The history of mankind is filled with gruesome crimes that too many have forgotten but hopefully we will not forget the Holocaust. In the next ten years we will lose most of the people that have a personal memory of the horrible ordeal that was WWII. At the same time we have a growing number of historical revisionists trying to rewrite history. (The revisionists are a part of ""historical school"" trying to deny the existence of the holocaust.)As a film this is not a perfect one. In truth it is maybe a 7/10 but what makes it important is that it makes an important moral/ethical/historical discussion easily accessible. Even the most uninterested student of history can take in the importance of remembering  just how horribly cruel we humans can be. But it also shows that we can all make a stand for what we think is right and not only for what is right for us. The core of the entire story just shows that in times of cruelty, humanity can still prevail.This is the final proof that Spielberg is a man with a big heart, not only a boy who loves fantasy.","

"TheNorthernMonkee","21 June 2005","SPOILERS Sixty years is a long time. When you compare the world today with 1945, so much has changed. People complain about multiple different things which really are quite petty. In contrast, all those years ago, the World was in a terrible state. Millions dead, countless cities destroyed, humanity took itself to the verge of extinction. Through brutal and inhumane methods, vast quantities of people were wiped off the Earth. One of the biggest groups of people to suffer were those of Jewish faith.Detested by Adolf Hitler due to a belief that they were responsible for the decline of the German power, Jews were slaughtered in huge numbers. Not all Germans followed this route however. Through the work of German 'heroes' like Oskar Schindler, some were saved. Telling the story of Schindler's list of Jewish workers, Steven Spielberg's 1993 film is not easy watching. At over three hours long, it is a powerful black and white piece which shows the brutality of the Nazi extermination of the Jews. It is an amazing piece of work which is understandably shown in schools. Just like Spielberg's later ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Schindler's List"" reminds us of parts of the war and it is a film which is crucial to the future development of the human race.As the German war machine spread across Europe, Hitler's army began to spread his beliefs across the land. Rounding up Jews and putting them into ghettos, the Nazi party began the slow process of wiping out a race of people. German industrialist Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) hated these events, and under the excuse of manufacturing for the war effort, he set about saving as many as he could.From the first moment to the last, it is hard not to be taken aback by this film. Ironically beautiful in a well shot black and white form, it recreates the ugly side of human nature. Whether it's Ralph Fiennes Nazi commandant or the misguided child spitting at the passing Jews, ""Schindler's List"" is not afraid to show this nasty side of humanity.Successful at the Oscars with awards for best film, director, adapted screenplay and others, the one disappointment is Neeson loosing out to Tom Hanks in ""Philadelphia"". Hanks was outstanding in that film as a man with aids, but throughout every scene of this film, Liam Neeson displays the finest acting he has ever done. From the first moment of exploitation of high ranking Generals through to his heartbreaking final scene, Neeson is outstanding.In terms of acting, Neeson is not alone in his quality. The amazing, and perhaps even more powerful, thing about ""Schindler's List"" is the way in which every single individual on the screen has you believing them. From the main characters through to the random five second Jew, every person on that screen is wonderful. You watch the actors playing a difficult role, and they do it so well, that it just makes the film even more powerful than it already is.One of the most crucial aspects about ""Schindler's List"" is the sense of the numbers. In any film where genocide is committed, it is incredibly easy to loose track of the numbers and become dehumanised to the suffering. Steven Spielberg shows throughout this film how aware he is of this. In the clearing of the ghetto though, Spielberg gives his clearest indication of bringing the individual back into focus. As the film progresses in black and white, during the ghetto scene, Spielberg has a little girl in a bright red coat running along innocently. This girl, this child, is trying to escape the danger, and both the audience and Schindler notice her distinctively. Spielberg focuses on this girl and then half an hour later we see her body amongst a pile of the deceased. We're reminded, brutally but crucially, that these are not just statistics but individuals with lives, families and dreams. We are shown that all this waste of human life is terrible, and that little girl stops us from ever growing numb to the vast quantities of dead.The issue of the Holocaust is not an easy topic to portray. If it is badly written, the story looses it's meaning slightly, if we are just shown large numbers of corpses we become desensitised. Steven Spielberg knows this. In ""Schindler's List"", Spielberg has created a masterpiece. Beautifully written and acted, the film is particularly powerful because it manages to use an attractive method of filming to show something truly terrible. From the first five minutes through to the conclusion, ""Schindler's List"" is an amazing piece of work. It is powerful, it is moving, and to try to prevent something like this happening again, it needs to be shown regularly in schools. Like a small number of films, ""Schindler's List"" is a masterpiece which reminds us of events we should never forget.","

"Chuck-149","8 September 1999","""Schindler's list"" ranks in two categories of films: The best movies in cinema history as well as in that category of movies whose subject is what people want to see transfered to the screen.  What I mean by that is this: The story of ""Schindler's list"" is how a Nazi works against the rest of the Nazis by making sure that all the Jewish people he can find will not be killed in concentration camps but work in his factory instead.  In other words, it's an anti-war and anti-Nazi movie.  And it's great.  Liam Neeson is excellent as Oskar Schindler, the one Nazi who doesn't want to see the Jewish people persecuted during WWII.  Ben Kingsley is very good as well as Iztak Stern, the Jewish man who Schindler employs to run the factory.  However, Ralph Fiennes performance is absolutely masterful.  His role is a crazy Nazi officer in charge of a concentration camp and he does a great job at it.  In fact, I believe he should have won best supporting-actor in ""Schindler's list"".  Moving, touching, and incredibly realistic, this based on a true story movie is a true gem and honor for cinema history and it's quite understandable that it is found among practically every movie-buff's top ten list.  It also has the great advantage of having been directed by another one of the masters, Steven Spielberg.  You've got to see it.","

"Lee-107","17 March 2002","After the release of 'Saving Private Ryan', Spielberg, in one of his interviews said that the purpose of a ""war"" film was to disenchant people from war, to show it so horrifyingly that no one would ever want a repetition of what happened in WWI and WWII. Spielberg's purpose in 'Schindler's List' which he made five years before 'SPR' is much the same. With calculated detail he drives home the horrors of war constantly. A third World War may not have the Nazis but there will always be someone who will be equally brainwashed and equally cruel as the Nazis were to the Jews. I've seen war films before(the series 'Escape from Sobibor' which I think was the most vivid), but Spielberg manages to show war in 'Schindler's List' with such a  menacing tenacity that you actually have to look away from the screen in some of the scenes. The story of Oskar Schindler starts in a very film noir style(especially the sequence of him in the bar), giving us the impression of him as a typical smooth-talking manipulative lady's man. But this is a very initial primary impression of a man who might be manipulative and a womanizer but whose humanity totally overshadows any of his vices. Liam Neeson is truly classic and magnificent in his portrayal of Schindler. His facial expressions(when he's on horseback, staring as a whole town is driven to ruins because of the Nazi atrocities), his whole demeanor, his voice, make Schindler one of the best characters ever portrayed by an actor. Liam Neeson deserved an Academy Award that year as much as Tom Hanks for 'Philadelphia' did. Sometimes it's a good idea to have a tie for the Oscar and give the Award to both! Because one actor's performance is just as good and commendable as the other's, especially when you have an actor like Neeson playing so complex a character as Oskar Schindler... Ralph Fiennes(who is so spectacular in 'The English Patient'), also gives a charged performance as Amon Goeth. His feelings for Helen, the Jewish girl who works for him are portrayed sensitively.This movie leaves you with images, you remember the camera tracking behind Neeson and into the bar, you remember him looking at the destruction of a whole town watching from a hilltop, the Nazi soldier playing Piano as people are getting killed, the doctors and nurses mercy-killing their patients so that they'd be dead before being shot by the Nazis, the little boy who saves the life of his fellow prisoners by his clever repartee to Goeth, the beautiful scene between Helen and Schindler in the wine basement, the boy running and hiding in a sewery, the girl in red escaping and hiding under her bed...images that linger long after they are seen. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is awe-inspiring! He treats us to a visual poetry in black and white, the way he did two years later in color in 'How to Make An American Quilt'. Spielberg's decision to use black and white is laudable, it suits the subject perfectly. Even where he has used color - showing the little girl's red dress, the yellow tones of the candle burning when the rabbi is chanting in Yiddish - the effect is poignant and symbolic.To say that 'Schindler's List' is a memorable film would be to understate its majesty. It is an altogether breathtaking cinematic experience!","

"petarmatic","5 March 2014","I wanted to write something meaningful about this film what it was not said before. I really do not have anything to add. Everything was said already. I should of given it 10/10, but I only gave that to one film and that is Nicija Zemlja. I know, may be it should of been reverse but it will have to stay that way.I am so angry with my parents. That they brought me to this world. I am even more angry that I fathered Theodore and Ian. I so much agree with Branko Lustig, God does not exist. Why do we repeat same mistake over and over again? Create children in such numbers that they will become adults and then die either by violent death or in bed? I am so angry, that each night before I go to bed I yell Heil Hitler and Sieg Heil and Deutchelland uber alles. My neighbours think I am crazy, but I am not. I am just so so angry! Inevitability of dieing is always there. From the moment I learned about this world I knew we will all perish sooner or later.So many books were written and films made about Holocaust and WWII that there is not much to add. That word Endoslung is the word. The final solution! After we clear Germany of that pestilence, we will live in peace and have plenty. We will rise our Ariyan children and be happy, we will not work much, Eastern Europeans will work for us in our Lebensraum and peace will prevail on Earth. But it is interesting, those Ariyan children would grow up and die, where is religion in all of that? Nazis did not have the time to think about that. Croatia is closest to what we have to that so called perfection. But you know what, I would rather not live in that perfection, if that is how perfection looks. If those shits refuse to come to Branko Lustig*s screenings and they are afraid of the truth which he is now spreading like mantra: God does not exist! then I do not want to be part of that perfection.Next time you put your penis into vagina and start doing that fantastic thing, I want you to think of Hitler or even better Himmler, I want that cold face to spoil your sex every time! There is no hope! We will all die, and our children will and their children will too. There is no God! Fairy tale!Heil Hitler! Sieg Heil! Good night and good bye! For ever!","

"jdkraus","8 May 2005","Truly, the best movie ever made! I movie that everyone should see if you don't like this movie, you should see a head doctor! it is a fabulous cinematic, that is winner of seven academy awards, including Best picture and director! Warner spoilers! This movie takes place in Germany, in the mid 1930s, before the Jews are being forced into the concentration camps. it is about a German wealthy citizen named Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson), who bribes many German officers to help him with his cause to make money. from all of his bribing, he ends up with a clever Jewish accountant named Stern (Ben Kingsley) who helps start his factory of making pots and pans.The plan succeeds, having over 350 Jewish workers, but suddenly the peace is ruined by a corrupted and ill-minded German officer named Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), who sends his Nazi goons into the ghetto of where Schindler's and countless other Jews are held. This is among the most powerful scenes of where the little girl in the red jacket is witnessed. for more than fifteen agonizing minutes, the Jews are rounded up, taken from their homes, and mercilessly shot, and among the captured is Stern (Ben Kingsley).Oscar witnesses the horrors of the Nazis against the Jews hatred, and feels obligated to save them in any means necessary to rescue as many as he can, not just for money, but for life! Truly, a magnificent and powerful film that reveals our inhumanity to one another and how much evil and hatred consumes this world. it is captivating and powerfully moving. It is among my top five favorites list of films I have seen in my short life. The ending, I guarantee will leave many in tears...","

"Theflyace","7 February 2014","Candles slowly burn during the Shabbat in a Jewish household. After many hours of burning and illumination, the flame goes out and gives off ominously rising smoke and reveals the black and white image that snuck in as the candles shrunk. Such is the tone that is set for the rest of the film Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg's tribute/justice to the millions of Jewish people slaughtered during the Holocaust.This particular chapter of the Holocaust is the portrait of the mysterious Oskar Schindler, and his actions during the war in Poland. We see him begin as an opportunist businessman, who wines and dines with the Nazi higher ups in exchange to receive funding for a factory he wishes to profit from. For both parties, Jews are considered ""cheap labor,"" therefore Schindler hires Itzhak Stern to handle rounding up a workforce in his new factory. Stern is really trying to save as many people as the ""Herr Direktor"" will allow from certain death. Over the course of the film, something changes in Schindler that drives him to save ""his Jews"" because he begins to realize the atrocities being committed around him, and that he must make a difference, even at the risk of losing his life in the process.Every actor in this film is perfect, no matter how big or small the role is. Liam Neeson gives his best work here as the complicated Schindler. It could have been a stereotypical ""revelation"" motivated performance, but Neeson never condescends to a perfunctory level. He is complimented in his performance by Ben Kingsley as the loyal and determined Stern. The actor who steals the film is Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth. He, like Neeson, has the hardest task of any actor, to give humanity to someone who is morally reprehensible on paper. His is one of those performances that was robbed of the recognition it deserved.Much like the film The Shawshank Redemption, this film delves into the souls of the people in the middle of a dark situation. Schindler himself is an enigma. here we have a man who begins thinking about only himself and his money, but realizes what his actions mean in the big picture of what's going on. As the film progresses, he begins to care about the people he has saved, and pours every ounce of energy and every cent of his money to make sure that they do not suffer the same fate as those who couldn't be saved. The character of Stern acts as his moral compass, convincing his boss that what he is doing is right. He does not always agree with his boss' logic, but works to make sure no one is killed or taken away to the ovens. The evil incarnate character Amon Goeth, is also conflicted by his feelings about this whole affair for one reason. He too hates the Jews with a brainwashed passion, but ironically falls in love with his Jewish housemaid. He struggles to come to terms with this fact while still managing to shoot Jews at random for sport.Director Steven Spielberg and writer Steve Zaillian take a really smart approach to the material, by not making the characters one-dimensional or motivated by a cheap cliché. We are never really clued into what makes Schindler change his mind about his workers until the very end of the film, which is a brilliant storytelling masterstroke.There is absolutely nothing glamorous at all in this film, which lends its greater sense of verisimilitude. The cinematography is in black-and-white, as it should be. If it had been in color, it would have been all wrong. Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski shoot this like a documentary, lending itself to far more realistic shots and actions than a straightforward drama. The violence is truly gut-wrenching and sickening, but again, it is an accurate view of what happened in real life. The disturbing image of bodies burning and the billowing smoke from the Auschwitz chimney won't leave one's mind for years after seeing this film. The girl in the red coat is the most haunting image from the film, as the filmmakers wished to convey the confusion of how people didn't even know this was happening, even though it ""stuck out like a girl wearing a red coat."" Spielberg knew just when to add color to the film, the moments when there is true despair or hope at the end of the filmThis film is made all the more haunting because of the first-rate score by John Williams. Backed with the violinist Itzhak Perlman, Williams delivers one of the best scores in eternity, and one that is never overblown. Both use their beauty to convey a dark passage in history, but most importantly, to highlight the success of the people saved. At a first glance, it would seem Spielberg was the wrong man to make this film, as his focus in his early career was on entertainment films and escapist images. With this film, we see him blossom into a true artist. He does not mince images or words in this film whatsoever. He presents the events depicted like it was, stark and hopeless. Spielberg so poured his heart into this material that it was reported that he sobbed every day during filming, but wouldn't relent in telling this story. This film is the greatest achievement in his career, not only in terms of Oscars and recognition, but his transformation as an artist.","

Anti-war, selflessness, love, sacrifice, family, friendship. Almost everything is in it.The cast and acting is beyond any possible criticism. The direction superb and the music a masterpiece.Some scholars of the holocaust disagree about its authenticity, but if the intention was to make a statement against war and touch a wider audience.Overall don't miss it. And prepare for a unique emotional ride.","

"Horst_In_Translation","27 January 2019","""Schindler's List"" is an American mostly English-language movie from 1993 that won Best Picture that year and took home another six Oscars including one for director Steven Spielberg, for whom it is probably still his career-defining work and with everything that he has under his belt like Jaws, Indiana Jones and much more, this means quite something. This film we have here runs for over 3 hours and I was lucky enough today to catch it on the big theater screen on the occasion of a very special day here in Germany. And what can I say. It was a feast. If that is an appropriate term given the heavy subject. I already wrote in the title of my review that this is of course a movie about the Holocaust. And it does not even try to hide the horrible deeds done by the perpetrators back then. Which means you have several occasions where you see people being shot in the head from the nearest distance and killed in cold blood for what their religion is. But it is also an uplifting movie as the man in the middle of it is Oskar Schindler, a manufacturer who saved more than a thousand Jewish lives during these perhaps darkest days in German (global) history. He is played by Liam Neeson and this is also his career-defining performance today without a doubt. Ralph Fiennes was around the age of 30 when he played the main antagonist here, Amon Göth, and Ben Kingsley, already an Oscar winner back then, is also on board and he looks so different compared to how he looks today, almost older you could say.By the way I did not know this film was based on a book in fact. It's really been a long long time since first time I saw it. But it is as good 25 years after its release as it was back then when I watched it for the first time. I must say I was not too touched throughout the movie as I hoped I could be and as I know many others were, but the last 20 minutes or so are heart-breaking stuff. I am talking about the moment when Schindler starts talking to his ""employees"", the guards I mean with that, as well as the Jews when he says he will be the hunted from now on. And then there is this powerful march with the haunting music at the very end before the film switches into the now, well into the early 1990s you must say, and we see the survivors, the Schindler Jews, and their offspring too and this idea of how Schindler did not only save these men, but saved entire generations and future children is so incredibly touching that there is no way your eyes won't get wet. I think my entire cinema could have finished drought in Africa when the closing credits rolled in. And lets not forget John Williams' beautiful beautiful soundtrack / main theme that is among the saddest tunes you will ever hear during a film and I know now already it is one that will never leave my head and ears. It was probably before watching this film the one thing that I have come across many times over the last years/decade and which I remembered better than anything else from this film.I was also glad to see parents with their children in the audience today, kids that were not even close to being born in 1993, so the film's message is carried on to the next generation. Well, what can I say. The Holocaust subject here in Germany is one that is very dominant today also in modern culture and there are constantly new exhibitions about this topic and also many new films still being made. And not just in Germany obviously. But I am pretty sure that none of these will ever reach the icon status of Schindler's List. Other really touching moments for me included the moment Kingsley calls the list something like ""ultimate goodness"", when we see earlier on the shoes and jewellery taken from Jews before their journey into destruction, the dead girl in the red dress etc. The latter is one you could talk about for ages and write an entire review about in my opinion. What is her significance? Well.. I would say this only use of color before the jump forward in time near the end is intended to emphasize that there is an individual human being behind every face and even if they don't stand out thanks to shining garments, we still should not forget that. Be it the one-armed men, the woman who knew so much about construction or everybody resting down there below Göth's balcony. They all have their stories and their loved ones and they all should not have died. It is very difficult in the presence of these sheer numbers of Jews being killed back then, but we shall not forget every one of them deserved to live. And every one of them has their own story. If we lose our empathy and become numb to what happened, then all is lost. And it is merely numbers that mean nothing to us.Okay, I mentioned Göth already. Fiennes was nominated for an Oscar for that portrayal and many today say he should have won instead of Tommy Lee Jones, but not having seen the latter's movie, I will not discuss that in detail. But I think it is a surprising loss, even with TLJ having the momentum given how much they loved Schindler's List. Like with the scene I mentioned some lines above, I also think that Göth could have deserved his own review. It is so difficult to say what this character is and what he is not. There is no 100% description, it is all about the shades. Very fitting the house keeper's description that you never knew what would happen next with him and how you could calm him down. Is he an opportunist? A sadist? A psychopath? A racist? Probably yes to all that, but then there are these moments when deep down inside him he has affections for the Jewish housekeeper before reality bites and he starts attacking her violently. The scene when he tells Schindler that he wants to take her with him is telling enough, only to say he should shoot her in the head in the nearest forest. Maybe this is the closest he can get to love? Tough to say. The relationship between Göth and Schindler is also interesting. I do think he looks up to Schindler for his success with women, his whole aura, his talent to entertain and he wants to be like him instead of being an alcoholic and gambling addict. Not many would have gotten away with the hose scene really, but Schindler does with the high-profile Nazis trying desperately to convince themselves that he is just torturing the Jews in the wagons. Of course he is not and they know. But they do not have the will and charisma to oppose him. The very first scene at the table when Schindler invites the Nazis over is already very telling, who is the man in charge. But he needs them too. Without being an NSDAP member, there is no chance for him to thrive and save a single life.And finally, lets look at the character transformations. Some brief words on Göth first who believes he is some high-appointed ruler about who lives and who dies thanks to Schindler's influence. There is no real goodness in the former. It is all make-believe and when he realizes he shoots the boy in cold blood. But about Schindler, there is a lot more to say, also when it comes to his wife and of course his heartfelt final speech about how he could have saved more. At some point, it was never about prestige, about reputation or about business anymore. Let alone about money. He gives it all away for his fake factory. This is when he turns into the good human being, which also has a lot to do with Stern's influence for sure. So yeah, this is a really long movie, but oh so rewarding and also for me a definite contender for best film of 1993. Don't give up on it if greatness is not achieved on all occasions early on. What is waiting for you is absolutely worth it.Of course, due to the cruel imagery, this is not a film for the very young ones, but even if it is extremely serious and will break your heart on more than one occasion, there are also really many moments, surprisingly more than I expected where this film will make you smile. These include basically all Schindler's exchanges and interactions with women, be it the ones sitting on his desk typing or the ones who want to see him or all the other ones attracted to him and the other way around. Or one other scene that stays in the mind very much for me is when he is looking for Stern at the train station and how these resilient Nazi guards help him quickly after being worried about their own future and having fear of being sent to Russia. So yeah, there is probably at least a dozen scenes more that stay in the mind and that I could write a whole chapter about and you will recognize these scenes when you watch them or maybe you will think of completely different scenes than the ones I mean, but that is perfectly fine though. I will spare you all that. But I will not spare you the words that this is an absolute must-see from the historic and emotional perspective and unless you really really hate Holocaust movies for whatever reason, you should watch this one. Actually, even if you do, you should watch it because this is the one film that can change your mind. Go for it if you really haven't seen it so far and with that I am of course speaking in particular to the younger readers. There's a reason this is so high on the imdb top250. And rightfully so. If you are lucky enough like myself to get into a big screen showing, then do not miss out under any circumstances. A gigantic thumbs-up from me for Schindler's List.","

"saytosandeep","26 July 2013","There are good movies, fantastic movies, mind blowing movies and then there is Schindler's List. It tells you the story of the time of holocaust during World War II and how one businessman Oscar Schindler (played by terrific Liam Nesson) becomes concerned about his Jewish work force after witnessing the massacre. It's black and white except the one last scene because there was no point of using colors till that point. It shows we the people can be nice and can be evil without giving a thought to the reason. It is as graphic as it can be while showcasing the horrors of war. You need to be really stone hearted if not moved by this emotional, horrific portrayal of war times. Ralph Fiennes as ruthless German and Ben Kingsley as Jewish business manager of Schindler's factory give knock out performances. But the movie belongs to legendary director Steven Spielberg's unmatched skills of directing the whole story with such uniqueness and conviction that is hard to believe. Schindler's List surely tops my list of top movies.","

Not because it is a bad film, quite the opposite is true, it is a very well made film with top notch acting, directing, everything. But it's content is so disturbing and some of hte violence so graphic that I couldn't sit through it again. There type of films show the true horror of war rather than the romatasized or comic book approach that leads successive generations of young men to think that war is a glamorous career, when in fact wars are full of evil and horror as this film so aptly depicts. And at last Steven Spielburg got an Oscar, something he should have had many times before since he has produced some of the best films ever in my opinion.","

The acting is phenomenal and Spielberg may be rightly accused of being manipulative, but any film that can move 80% of an audience (I attended an opening night showing) to tears is incredible. There's a technical kudo: review the tracking shot Spielberg used when the Nazis invade the city (Schindler's on horseback on a date)... an astonishing achievement (superior to famous 1962's The Longest Day tracking scene...). I also love some of our foreign friends' opinions vis-a-vis our treatment of Indians, the Ludlow Massacre, etc. (inarguably horrible chapters in U.S. history). But that's akin to saying a British film stinks thanks to the Crusades. This is an outstanding film and certain scenes still resonate in my head (the child in the latrine, Schindler's end-of-film breakdown... or how I never could seem to pronounce Ralph, Rafe... Raphe... Finney... Finez... oh, forget it). This rates a 10++++ (and I hated 1941 and had a difficult time with Empire of the Sun...)","

"funsterdad","25 April 2017","A fellow reviewer started his review of ""Schindler's List"" almost on the defensive, with an assumption that others might be critical of his determination of this film as one of the greatest, that he would place it ""up there"" (my words) with ""The Godfather"" and ""Citizen Kane."" I'm going to contend that ""Schindler's"" is not only among the greatest, it goes down in historical terms as perhaps one of the most important films ever made. This truth-based story is most compelling, holding this viewer's interest intact throughout for 195 minutes. Liam Neeson does a most incredible job as the hero/anti- hero, Oskar Schindler. A super cast also includes Ralph Fiennes, a perfectly played antagonist, and Ben Kingsley, in the first role following his Oscar-winning performance as Gandhi. It took this viewer quite some time before realizing that the character of Itzhak Stern was indeed played by the masterful Kingsley.The cinematography is key to the story telling, filmed in a crisp black and white to recapture the era and help accentuate the mood. Credit is due Steven Spielberg, as he eventually adds in a few small elements of color which give us hope. The atrocities committed by Nazi Germany against the Jewish race is a history that cannot ever be overlooked and/or forgotten. To that end, ""Schindler's List"" is a very important film that can help generations to come to develop greater empathy for their fellow man. I can't begin to emphasize how important this film should be to any serious film viewer.","

"kechhh","18 March 2013","This movie was ugly and grotesque, in other words, perfect for what the film was trying to achieve.The movie depicted vividly and well the dehumanization of the Jews at the hands of Nazis during World War 2. The ugly scenes, massacres, and killings helped at least give you a feel of the terror and fear these people must have felt at the time.Usually, I don't find movies based on true events to be as interesting, but this was an exception. The final scenes where they show the real life Schindler Jews visiting his grave was touching and helps solidify the realities of what happened.One issue I had was the movie being in black in white - I felt it was unnecessary and the same feelings could have been achieved with a color movie. Related to this, I felt the red dress girl was overkill and also unnecessary. Finally, the final scene of him crying didn't seem to be that realistic - perhaps a bit overdone to me.Other than those issues, I felt the movie was great and done well.","

"charchuk","8 January 2008","Finally watched it. And, even with everything it's been hyped up to be, I was still impressed. I thought it worked best when it was just focusing of Schindler, and showing his growing reaction to the horrors around him, rather than outright showing the atrocities, but you can't really fault Spielberg for showing bits like the Ghetto liquidation scene, or the shower scene, because they're so powerful without really being manipulative at all. The only bit that really falls into emotional manipulation is the final scene with the rocks, which really took me out of the movie and was obviously a personal, not artistic, choice by Spielberg.I was also very surprised at how technically superb and inventive the film was. I expected the powerful impact, but I didn't expect some rather creative shots like the piano playing during the liquidation, or the distant shadow at the top of the long staircase. It's really a beautifully shot film, which is refreshing, because Spielberg could have easily gone for a gritty, raw feel and probably still got the same effect, but the near-noir like set-up made the on-screen horrors even more unbearable, due to their glamourized feel.The acting is almost uniformly excellent, from Neeson's gradual growth over the film, to Fiennes' unredeemably evil yet almost sympathetic villain, to Kingsley's quiet nobility, and Embeth Davidtz's rather underrated turn as Amon Goeth's housemaid. It's really a shame that the film won no acting Oscars, as it truly deserved some, especially Fiennes for his tormented performance. The story is not the typical ""exposition-build up-climax-denouement"" but I liked that, as you really didn't know where the story was heading next, and it gave the whole thing a sense of danger and desperation, much like what the characters would feel.This was probably the most well-known and well-received film that I hadn't seen, and now that I have, I have to say I'm not disappointed, though I don't know how many more times I'll be watching it. It really takes a lot out of you. Furthermore, despite how much I loved it, it's probably not even in my top five Spielberg films, which is really a testament to how many superb films he's made.","

"policy134","15 December 2008","You can't really find anything that is as powerful, thought-provoking and tragic as seeing this superb film from the director, often accused of dealing with more flashy projects. Even so, as tragic as the subject matter is, it is not a depressing film.We see Oskar Schindler (a brilliant performance by Liam Neeson), con man and war profiteer. He likes the finest things in life (good wine, women and most of all money) but a metamorphosis occurs where he simply doesn't care about any of it and loses everything in order to save his workers, who happen to be Jews. He is himself a member of the Nazi party.On the other hand we have Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes in a part that defines evil), the ruthless leader of the death camps where Jews are killed left and right, simply to terrorize the living Jews who mistakenly believes that the Nazis operate logically. He is stupid, alcoholic and a miserable human being. Fiennes plays his part with absolutely no redeeming qualities and the scary part is that you can't figure him out. A bizarre sequence between Schindler and Goeth illustrates this point, where Schindler tries to explain true power. We think that Goeth will take the advice of Schindler, only to learn that Spielberg goes the other way. Quite schocking.Both Schindler and Goeth pay for their actions and you can't really say that either of them is a hero or a villain. Spielberg doesn't want us too root for anyone, he mainly shows us what happened. Of course, many people consider Schindler a hero but Liam Neeson never plays the hero. He simply seems to have lost interest in all what he held dear in the beginning.What is so fascinating about this movie is hard to explain. It doesn't have one glamorous moment and there are many horrifying scenes. Maybe it's this: It's a depiction of triumph of the human spirit (sounds cliché, doesn't it?) but it is nevertheless true.","

"braddugg","19 September 2014","A masterpiece that is profoundly humane and indeed tragic yet hopeful.'Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.'I finally made it, I cannot ever see the whole picture at once for it's brutality that was displayed, but yesterday night I did it gone through the film at length and just took a water break and the 3 hour long saga made me cry even an hour after it was ever. I am emotional and certainly have deep feelings, I cam to restore them again with very film. It made an impact and it re emphasised the value of the life a human, I know what a loss means, I have gone through that, I just can't bear any untimely losses anymore. Here, they are organising a crime of execution of poor souls.I wrote the film is in English, though 40% of it is German and Polish.It's about Oskar Schindler, a Nazi man man who saved more than 1100 Jews from the holocaust of the German Army. 6 million Jews were killed them can you imagine how much it is, 6000000. That is, a whole race was being eliminated and this man stood up against all odds, and saved 1100 of those. Now, this did happen and Oskar Schindler is one of the few heroes who must be revered for what he done to Jew community specifically and to humanity at large. I can say that I am now happy to be reviewing a masterpiece that shows a world of a different kind, a world that I never knew of, but it happened to exist in the world ward 2 under Hitler's regime. A world where they call you names, just to kill you, where people are not afraid to be dead either. This was what Taliban had did to those in Afghanistan.Now cinematically it's flawless, it's 3 hours but no editing is needed, any cut would demean the value of a life of a Jew, it's best the way it is, cinematography, sound, music, set design and art direction are sublime. Now, what' great is you have nearly thirty thousand people working on a film and they themselves make a world that is real in every sense. The actors everyone of them is just so real. We watch history and many epic films but this one is something else. It is by far the greatest documentary made on war. I cannot say anything about the genius of Spielberg, I am no worth even to utter a word of single word of praise. About the film, I can say this much, you might not like to watch it many times, but if you did it once, it's highly unlikely to forget anything about this film. By the way, I loved Itzhak Stern played by Ben Kingsley, he is more a hero here than anyone else. It's not about applauding the team for such a masterpiece, it's about thanking them for what they have done to humanity by depicting history the way it was. They brought us a story that teaches us value of a life, what more can you ask. I am speechless and even a 5/5 rating seems so less, to this masterpiece.Ah, it's aching me even now as I write this in the joy of pain. Salutauions to the heroes who have saved lives and our only little tribute we can give them is by knowing their story, so please watch this film.Those, who have seen this, they may better know where it comes. For those who have not, here is a scene from the ending of the film.","

"fredericksmith1952","9 February 2012","This amazing story is, in my humble opinion, the epitome of Spielberg's work. To bring a story like this to the screen is nothing short of magnificent. It would be difficult to single out a particular actor for their contributions, since the film is so cohesive and unified. You are immediately drawn into the action, you are watching the events unfold as if you were there. Liam Neeson's performance as Schindler is dynamic and compelling. At first he appears the opportunist and war profiteer, but his growth through the film lets you feel his compassion. Ben Kingsley's quiet and steady demeanor throughout the film compliments Neeson's. Ralph Fiennes is the quintessential Nazi camp commandant, unhappy to be where he is, ruthless in his orders, and totally without compassion. He is a soulless man who cannot feel love or hate, simply disdain for the Jews, as if they were cattle. There are so many scenes in this film that speak to your soul, but perhaps the most important line in the film occurs near the end. ""If you save one life, in time you save the world."" The violence and cruelty of the film make it unsuitable for those under 14, and between 14 and 17, I would use sound judgment. A definite collectors item, and if they haven't shown this to your teens in high school, they ought to. This is a reminder of the inhumanity man can reach if he has nothing to stop him.","

"punctate","3 September 1999","I thought I would watch the movie again before I reviewed it, which is easy since I have it on tape. I have seen this movie a number of times and it still impresses me. Schindler's List is Steven Spielberg's most extraordinary movie. It's the true story of Oskar Schindler a business man who saved over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. It won 7 Academy Awards inaddition to a number of other awards including the Director's Guild. The Cinematography for this movie was brilliantly done, it was truly haunting. This film had some of the best performances I have seen. Ralph Fiennes did an excellent acting job when took on the character Amon Goeth. Amon a man who likes his Jewish maid a little too much, he seems to be quite disturbed and also is quite brutal. Liam Neeson acting so also excellent he really played the role. Oskar Schindler is a member of the Nazi party who is a womanizer and a war profiteer. He character changes very much because he knows what the Germans are trying to due the Jews. The scene where the Germans remove the Jews from the Ghetto is disturbing and well directed. The unearthing of the bodies scene is haunting and disturbing. The ending of this movie brings a tear to my eye everytime. An extraordinary film with a compelling story and stunning score. 10/10 for this masterpiece. Number 9 on the AFI's 100 greatest movies.","

Fiennes portrayal is absolutely frightening as he steals each scene he is in in this remarkable film.The ending will tear at your heart as those saved place stones on Jewish graves.A positively memorable Holocaust film with memorable detail depicted.

"jmhammerstein-980-842586","4 November 2016","Schindler's List is a wonderful movie. It's about the holocaust and it focuses on a man named Oskar Schindler who was a NAZI during World War 2 and came to feel compassion for Jews and saved some of them from being killed in the holocaust. It is mainly a movie to show the horrible reality of the holocaust to educate people about it. It is mostly in black and white which is a very unusual and wonderful thing. Color in it includes the red dress of a little girl that is killed and at the end. The dress is seen as red when the girl is walking outside and when she is dead with everything else in those shots in black and white. The movie has a lot of very disturbing scenes. The most disturbing to me was when one of the particularly cruel Nazis tries a number of times to shoot to death a Jew for making hinges slowly and the gun won't shoot. Schindler's List is an amazingly good and very important movie.","

"Doylenf","25 April 2001","Words are not enough to describe the overall impact of this powerful film about a profiteer (Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler) during World War II who uses the Jews as cheap labor in his factory until he decides to save over 1,000 of them from death in the gas chamber. Nor are there enough adjectives to describe the performances--especially Liam Neeson as the enigmatic Schindler, a complex man who ironically becomes a saviour of Jewish souls. Although lengthy, it never once loses tension or interest and the decision to use black and white photography was a wise one, considering that all the war footage in the '40s was seen only in monochrome. Ralph Fiennes gives a masterful performance as the chief Nazi villain and should have won a Best Actor Oscar for his work. The John Williams score has a haunting quality--his main theme is a fascinating example of his uncanny ability to connect with the material he was scoring. As powerful a film as ever emerged about World War II, this film will undoubtedly increase in reputation as the years pass, fully deserving of all the praise it reaps. So real that some of it is difficult to sit through--but no serious minded filmgoer should miss it.","

"blackmamba99971","17 March 2017","Steven Spielberg has brought us the most in not the most important film to date. A tale of the holocaust where Jews had been lied to about the relocation programs during the Nazi occupation. Liam Neeson who plays Oscar Schindler. A man on a quest to help Jewish people from certain death while the SS regime uses the lie in order to implement what would be called; ""The Final Solution."" A horrendous policy where Jewish prisoners are transported to concentration camps only to be executed because of their race.It is Oscar himself who spares the lives of some eight hundred Jewish political prisoners as he becomes the go-between for both the German Nazi party, and the Jewish community. Using a factory as a front he employs the same eight hundred people waving his contract of absolute immunity towards the German Reich. Yet not all German officers believe that he is a genuine compatriot to the cause which results in an investigation from both the allies, and the Nazi party.I found this to be the most excellent and highly informative adaptations from one of the best film makers of all time. It injects horror, despair, anguish with the distant light of hope at the end of the rainbow. The vision to this movie held me spellbound watching the horrible acts against the Jewish people as they are processed, stripped of all humanity and finally imprisoned with only the hand of the Grim reaper out waiting for his next soul. It wrenches your heart while witnessing vile acts from a people who were once close neighbours to one another.The real hero of this film is Oscar. Without him eight hundred people would have died in the same concentration camps as their families did who could not attain freedom if for only a few more years during World War II. Ben Kingsley who played Itzhak Stern was brilliant as was Ralph Fiennes who played his sadistic role as Amon Goeth. With these three seasoned actors alone Schindler's List will live on as the most undisputed war film of the century. I highly recommended this film to all ages who must understand that war is the only evil on this earth, and those individuals involved or creates a war must atone for their sinful crimes.","

"domino1003","22 January 2004","**********POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!**********To this day, this film has made an impact on me. It shows how the one man can make a difference.Oskar Schindler(Wonderful performance by Liam Neeson)is not a saint: He is a lousy husband, a womanizer, drinks too much, and has no luck in business. Poland provides the stuff of his dreams. He opens a business and makes money, he has a nice house, nice clothes and money. Unfortunately, it comes at the expense of the Jews of Poland. He uses their labor (They don't get paid for the work they do for him) and their homes(A Jewish couple was forced to leave their home, which Schindler eventually takes).Amon Goeth (A Chilling Ralph Fienes)arrives to create a forced labor camp outside Krakow and proceeds to ""liquidate"" the ghetto. This part of the film is incredibly brutal: men, women and children are shot to death throughout the ghetto as a little girl in red (Equally chilling, since the film is in black & white)wanders through the horror. What Schindler does at this point in time, watching the little girl in red, is to become a hero. He begins to use his wealth and power to save the Jews that are working for him. However, when the labor camp is closed and the Jews are marked for Auschwitz, he comes up with a plan: Buy the workers. With the help of his accountant Stern (Brilliantly played by Ben Kingsley), he creates a list of the workers, a list of people to be saved from the gas chambers of Auschwitz. From start to finish, this film is a history lesson. You see the good the can happen (The change in Oskar), as well as the evil that men do (Goeth's morning ""target practice"" on the labor camp workers is horrifying). Spielberg created a masterpiece in film making, as well as an object history lesson of the Holocaust. Have the Kleenex at hand whenever you watch this film.","

Shows well the extremes of man's inhumanity to other men (the Nazi concentration camps and the systematic extermination of the Jews) and how there is also good in the world, fighting this evil. Quite graphic in showing what the Jews went through. This makes the saving of many of them from this fate even the more emotional.Superb performance by Liam Neeson in the lead role. An equally compelling performance comes from Ralph Fiennes as the sadistic SS concentration camp commander. No cartoon villain, Fiennes inhabits the role and makes him a worthy adversary for Schindler and an evil that must be vanquished.","

"gulherme","10 February 2016","Schindler List is a movie about everything, begins with most basic values in the human natures until a complex analysis of war society, and find a journey to the human heart, in good and bad forms. Schindler list is a movie 10 in all questions, history, photography, OST and in send a message.First we need know the movie is about a couple relationship between the Nazi government, German business man and the Jewish people. Schindler is entrepreneur, capitalist and a good negotiator, he has good relationships with military, and military enjoy your source of guns and material to support the war. A well established relation, Schindler keep low cost using prisoner as cheap labor to his factors, a smart but not decent idea.Although his well wealthy business, Schindler decide he can change the world. This is the main point of the movie, and how he star to achieve a bigger goal instead the quarterly balance sheet profits. Schindler decide all system is not correctly, and he understand a change is need.The lesson in this film is the status quo isn't a law, it can be changed by the humans. When oppression is the law, kill is normal, when human are properties have a act to change all it is the right decision. Schindler is what all we need in the moderns day, a break point in the society, a hero doing the obvious, a man whit heart and ambition to change the world.","

"roghache","22 March 2006","Stephen Spielberg's amazing Schindler's List is an incredibly moving, graphic depiction of Holocaust horrors, as they relate to one unlikely humanitarian hero. The Czech born German businessman, Oskar Schindler, starts up a factory in Poland, intending to make his fortune by taking advantage of cheap Jewish labor. As he becomes increasingly aware of the concentration camp horrors, his motivations change from profit to helping his fellow man, and he is able to save 1100 Jews from the atrocities and gas chambers of Auschwitz.Liam Neeson is brilliant in the role of the cool and very human Oscar Schindler, an ordinary businessman not lacking in human frailties himself. The only other actor that I specifically recall from the movie is Ben Kingsley (who earlier played Gandhi), always wonderful in any role.Just a trivial detail, but I found very touching the Jewish custom of placing stones on the graves of loved ones. It is used with dramatic effect in this movie. This is a superbly crafted film, the use at times of black and white photography giving a starkly moving, documentary mood. The movie serves as a dramatic tribute to one ordinary and obviously flawed man who, through good will, smarts, and audacity, was able to save so many lives. It is also a troubling personal depiction of the Holocaust, brought to horrific life to many viewers because of Spielberg's efforts. However, it is NOT of course, by any means, an entertaining film. I have not seen it since its original release and find it too disturbing to deliberately set forth to watch a second time.Although some reviewers have criticized the insensitivity and false portrait, I'd also recommend the Italian film, Life is Beautiful, for a different and unusual view of concentration camps, a story filled with love, humor, and optimism. Also, although I believe there was in years past a TV movie of some sort (starring Richard Chamberlain?), I'd like to see a major film done on another Holocaust hero, Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved countless Hungarian Jews. I put Wallenberg in a similar heroic category along with Oskar Schindler.Schindler's List is a must see movie, both disturbing history and extraordinary heroism brought dramatically to life on the screen.","

"faincut","6 May 2005","Steven Spielberg made a lot of money out of his successful film, and yes, he also finally received an Oscar (Although I think some of his earlier work should receive one too). There are many interesting stories about the holocaust and WWII, and I wonder what attracted Spielberg to Schindler's story so much. Well, if you saw the film you can see that what Spielberg and Schindler have in common is money and ambition. Spielberg in my point of view is a great producer/business man. He knows how to make money (even for the Holocaust). I believe that is why Spielberg's so attracted to Schindler's character. Don't get me wrong, Spielberg has also values as well, and it is said that most of what the film has earned Spielberg donated to the Holocaust foundation. Spielberg is a franchise but I get the feeling that he cares. So in parallel to Schindler's character that evolves through the film, Spielberg uses the money he earns to make some good.Schindler is presented as a business man, who is interested in making money - actually a war profiteer. But something changes in his plan, Schindler learns slowly that the Nazi ideology is stupid and evil, and he goes on a process through the film of purging himself out of this ideology. He starts to care for ""his Jewish workers"", and by the end of the film he even cries, not for the loss of money, but for the life he could have saved.There are many scenes in this film, created in detail, through the help of survivor's testimonies. Some of them are extremely violent or contain nudity. Those scenes, which are shot brilliantly, are required for realism and I really like them, as I believe that such appalling violence is reserved only in film and not in our life.I find Schindler's List as a visual experience one should not miss, as it helps you grasp the horror and violence of the Nazis. Since Hollywood controls the world market of cinema, this movie is a breakthrough, bringing the story of the holocaust to the whole world.","

He is so good that for months I didn't know he wasn't German. And his character is truly vile. Read up on the real Amon Goeth and you will see what an evil man he portrayed. He probably didn't care, but good golly.Secondly, having dated an observant Jew for a long time, I can attest to the Talmud quotation. My boyfriend believed and lived that precept.No, this film is not earth-shaking, but once you see it, please remember that some of the people who made the film with Spielberg were, themselves, survivors.

"Hairy_Lime","22 January 2004","This movies is one of the most emotionally shattering and ultimately uplifting movies ever made. Ther story of one man who begins the movie eager to make a profit from the slave labor of the Jews, and ends it by sacrificing everything to save them. Neeson's central performance is solid, if unspectacular - he is overshadowed by Fiennes, who shows a frightening ability to capture unspectacular and always human face of evil - but his somewhat stolid performance may simply reflect a trait that allowed Schindler to dupe the Nazis. Kingsley, in the other central role, tends to slide into the background.The decision to shoot in black and white - as a confession, I love the look and texture of black and white - was perfect. Janusz Kaminski's black and white cinematography is a brilliant example of why B&W is superior to color in any film with an intimate feel or that deals with moral ambiguity. The trouble I have with the movie was - SPOILER - the two scenes at the end; one with Schindler breaking down when the Jews that he worked to save go free, and he weeps over the lives he could have saved with his car, or his ring, or his suit, and the pebble scene at the end. It felt like a return to the mawkish sentimentality of earlier Spielberg movies: a blatant attempt at jerking tears from me, which I resent all the more because it worked, I suppose.If Spielberg could have resisted the emotional hammer on this ine, it would have been a true classic.","

"krumski","15 June 2003","SPOILERS WITHIN. Don't read unless you've seen the movie.At this point, almost a decade after its release, Schindler's List is what it is: it has become a cultural touchstone, and its reputation rightfully precedes it. It certainly has an aura and a cachet that goes beyond any single endeavor to praise or criticize it; therefore, I plan to do neither, but merely to share some of the thoughts I had while watching it. Some will be positive, others more negative - but none of it is meant to (or will be able to) diminish what Spielberg has achieved with this movie.First off, I must say that all the scenes with Schindler himself I found riveting: Liam Neeson - not an actor I usually warm up to very well - was absolutely mesmerizing: he gave the character an authority and a charisma that was totally captivating, while still preserving the basic enigmatic nature of the man. (He reminded me again and again of a young Richard Burton when he was at the top of his game.) The tug-of-war of conscience in the scenes between him and Stern (Ben Kingsley, underplaying nicely) were, though a bit schematic and obvious, nonetheless powerful - no doubt because of the enormity of the topic at hand. Holocaust movies, of course, can very easily get a free pass because of that very enormity, and Schindler's List is no exception: scenes that might otherwise have seemed simplistic or overplayed are imbued with power because of the context in which they occur.One scene that stuck out for me, though - and not necessarily in a good way - was the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. It is of course a tour-de-force of filmmaking and technical prowess (a foreshadowing, say, of the Normandy Beach sequence in Saving Private Ryan), but its reason for being I found suspect. Ostensibly - on the level of the story, anyway - it was there to bring Schindler face to face with the horror and waste of the Nazi policy toward the Jews, and so to suggest a reason why he converted from shameless profiteer and exploiter to Jewish savior.Except, as such a scene, it doesn't quite wash. Schindler indeed is displayed as witnessing the liquidation, but from his vantage point - a hill overlooking the ghetto - he would in no way have been able to see the scene in the detail, and in all the different locations, that the movie makes us privy to. No, this scene is designed not to be played before Schindler, but to be played before us, the moviegoers.So why does that bother me? Well, it seems to me a break in form. A movie that had been, up until that time, focusing narrowly on one man, suddenly opens up to wanting to display the panoply of characters and lives that were directly affected by the Holocaust. Problem is, by adopting such a large-scale approach, no one individual (or family) is able to claim our full attention, and so Spielberg becomes guilty in his own way of `ghetto'-izing the Jews - that is, grouping them together facelessly as victims, rather than showcasing any of their dignity or humanity as individuals.My bias, I suppose, in films dealing with the Holocaust, is that the enormity of it is just lost on most of us. It's impossible - unless we lived and survived through it - to do justice to both its scale and its horror. Therefore, a film-maker shouldn't try. Not that Holocaust-themed films shouldn't be made; it's just that, to be honest and effective (not necessarily the same thing - particularly when the artist is Spielberg) they should focus themselves on a small *microcosm* of it - a family, a person, a survivor - and attempt to *SUGGEST* the full horrors, through the particulars of that person's story. Actually trying to show those horrors outright (to put us, as it were, `inside' the Holocaust) is frankly impossible, and I think Spielberg's ambitions to do so, through this liquidation scene and other similar ones in the movie - are, though perhaps high-minded, ultimately wrong-headed.But, as I say, when he's focused narrowly on Schindler himself, the film works wonderfully - and is far more able, in my opinion, to get across the horror and waste of the Holocaust than when it's concentrating on its big (but impersonal) `herd up the Jews' scenes. The making up of the list itself is extremely powerful in this regard: `More names! More names!' Schindler demands, and his mania in doing so tells us all we need to know about the absolute desperation of the times (particularly as it comes from a formerly amoral man only interested in himself).And as such, I must take exception to all those (and there are many) who find the last scene - Schindler's breakdown - to be completely maudlin and ill-advised, a detriment to an otherwise marvelous motion picture. To me, it was the best scene in the movie. For, in the character's hysterical insistence that he `could have done more' - coming on the heels of all the people we saw that he *DID* save - it serves to remind the audience - in absolutely unambiguous terms - that what Oskar Schindler did, though momentous, wasn't'even a drop in the bucket compared to the number of lives taken and/or disrupted by the Holocaust. That this man - driven to bankruptcy and ruin by his (eventual) unceasing efforts to save the Jews - could claim that he `didn't do enough,' only shows how much there was to do, and how much of it was left undone. That, to me, is the kind of moment that brings home the enormity of the Holocaust - not the use of hundreds of extras to be herded onto trains and into showers. We can tell ourselves (and be right) that those scenes are fake (staged for the movie). The point made through Schindler's breakdown at the end is the deepest kind of truth - the kind that never should be forgotten or cast aside.","

"mOVIemAN56","21 March 2006","Arguably one of the greatest films ever made, Schindler's List details the struggles of two men who are trying to save as many people as they can during the Holocaust of World War II. Our main character, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a German business man who runs a company which builds supplies for the German Army. Oskar employs many Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto because he can pay them near nothing to do long hours of labor. He treats them good and if one of his workers is harmed by a Nazi officer he writes letters of complaints and demands retribution for the damage.As the movie progress', Oskar meets Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley). Stern helps Schindler to run the company and is constantly hinting a plea for help to his boss. Slowly, Schindler begins to witness the horrors of the Holocaust after witnessing the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto and the slaughter of hundreds of Jews. Soon Schindler is no longer a cold-hearted German who has a schedule for when his goods need to be made but a man seeking to save everyone he can.Schindler's Lsit draws you in with the very first scene and holds you until the last credit rolls of the screen. Filmed entirely in black and white except for the first and last scene, the movie brings forth a n awesome sense of realism and authenticity. The sets are stunning and the effects sued are captivating.The movie also uses some symbolism which is odd for a Spielberg film. The infamous girl in red is the only character in the entire film who appears in color while the rest is black and white. She is put forth to represent to the conversion of Oskar and is used in only two scenes.Liam Neeson is able to captivate the audience with his breathtaking performance. He is cool and quick thinking, a ladies man and a sly talker. He is able to bring forth the desperation of his character by the end of the film of how hurt and damaged his soul is from what he has witnessed. he is able to bring for Oskar like no other with a sense of realism and compassion, he brings forth a man who is trying to save as many people as he can.I had no idea that Ben Kingsley was in this film until reading the cast list after seeing it. He barely ever talks but when he does, his words will bring tears to your eyes. He brings out the suffering of the Jews and how they are truly innocent of everything the Nazi's hold them accountable for. Kingsley continues with this film to be one of the greatest actors in the industry.The last of the main characters is Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), a troubled German officer and sort of commandant of the concentration camp that Oskar's workers come from. Fiennes kick started his career with this role. Acting opposite of Neeson, he is able to hold his own and bring out the lunacy of what the German's planned to do. You can't help feeling pity for him but also an overwhelming sense of hatred at the same time. It is Fiennes finest role to date.Schindler's List is one of a very few select films that are able to convey a sense of humanity. It shows that murder and genocide solve nothing and that the greatest power to posses is to be able to have power but spare an enemy. The film moved me in a way that I have never felt before, this film will truly stun you.5 out of 5 Stars","

"wvriend","1 May 2014","Showing the monstrosities of war as performed and underwent by normal people in special situations. No specific stereotype good and bad guys. No romantic feeling left regarding war after seeing this masterpiece of human tragedy. Instead of films like, The Piano where the world consists of clearly good or German (stereotype dumb, cruel), Schindler's List shows people who are trapped in war and loose their way. Whether because they are being persecuted, part of the German army or civilians who try to survive. Schindler's List doesn't judge and doesn't need to. A fairly straight account is given from the live and thoughts of the main characters. Emotional stress is sometimes evoked by shots in black- and-white: no overacting needed. Just sit down with your kids and get a real picture of human tragedy at the 2nd world war as took place in Eastern Europe.","

"kingtanichi","1 March 2004","WARNING: ONE MINOR SPOILERThis film has often been accused of being so emotionally powerful as to suppress objective analysis. It's almost thuggish in how hard it makes it to step back and rationally look for the flaws you know must be there, but you've been so shaken by the experience of the film you don't want to look for them.And to these accusations I say: CONGRATULATIONS STEVEN SPIELBERG! In an age when too many Hollywood epics have you checking your watch (you know who you are Cold Mountain), it's nice to see one that instead makes you check a mirror to see if your tear-stained face is too dishevelled.
Liam Neeson demonstrates just why he is the best actor around for playing secular saints (or Catholic, in this case, but in general...), Ralph Fiennes creates one of film history's most complex villains; Goeth is evil, no doubt, but there are still moments when we genuinely like him. As for Ben Kingsley, well he gives another great performance in a career full of great performances. The black and white photography is not pretentious, it's perfectly natural for the period atmosphere the film creates. It wouldn't have worked nearly as well in colour, plus, they wouldn't have been able to do the girl in the red dress, which in itself justifies the decision. And yes, this is a very violent film, but it's not ground-breakingly bloody, and as with Saving Private Ryan later on, Spielberg avoids being gratuitous.Are there any problems? Well, I've seen the film three times, and there's only one thing that bugs me: the scene near the start where the Jews are being herded into the ghetto, and the little girl scoops mud up from the gutter to hurl it at them, shouting ""Goodbye Jews!"" There's just an annoying screech to her voice, and it isn't improved by having her repeat it over and over in exactly the same tone. There's a sincerity that seems lacking.
Given that my sole quibble lasts 10 seconds at most, out of a three hour-plus movie, should about close the case. It's a masterpiece.","

"Jaime N. Christley","4 June 1999","One thing we forgot about Steven Spielberg, that no one really seems to notice.  He is the most skillful handler of gallows humor outside of Tarantino and the Coen brothers.Gallows humor:  the pain of real life, happening to someone else.  Please understand, I'm not speaking of the truly horrifying scenes of massacre in this film and ""Saving Private Ryan"".  I'm talking about specific instances only.  Consider the scene in the ""...Ryan"" film where a soldier is struck in the helmet with one bullet, is amazed that he has lived, and is shot through the head after another soldier comments, ""lucky bastard.""  It has the rhythm of comedy, and we might laugh if we weren't scared stiff.  It shocks us and keeps us off-balance, which is precisely why both movies work so very well for all of their considerable running times.  They also give Spielberg license to be sentimental later on--he's EARNED his right to be sentimental in those movies.The thirty-minute opening to ""...Ryan"" and many scenes in ""Schindler's List"" grip people in a very unique way, and often they can't completely describe it.  That's because they CAN'T completely sum up how they feel.  Here's what it is.  Spielberg never lets us settle down with one defense mechanism for these sequences, because when we do we let our guard down somewhere else. I can say with impunity and without exaggeration that Spielberg is the finest manipulator of movie audiences since Alfred Hitchcock.""Schindler's List"" could've been just another comprehensive look at the Holocaust.  I'm not saying that that would not have been needed, but I'm very impressed that he didn't settle for ""just another.""  He's made a remarkable film memorializing the most heinous criminal act in modern times, and he made it DIFFERENT from every other movie we've ever seen.  Yes, there are influences we can catalog, and we can argue that no filmmaker has really done anything special with the cinematic art since D.W. Griffith, but that's not my point.  Spielberg has sewn in moments of grief, fear, depressing thrills, breathtaking spectacles, grotesquely brutal acts, and perfect little snippets of comedy.  The Wagner-backed helicopter raid in ""Apocalypse Now"" did that for about twenty minutes.  Spielberg has given us three gorgeous, haunting hours.","

"wellthatswhatithinkanyway","21 December 2004","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs The true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) a German businessman during World War 2 who saved the lives of around 1100 Jews by creating a use for them as labourers in his factories before moving them to his hometown as a safe refuge from Auswhictz in the closing days of World War 2.I'm not sure quite what Spielberg was trying to accomplish by filming this project in black and white,but if he was trying to add a darker,more authentic tone than the film already had,he has failed.There was colour back in those dark times of the Holocaust,and it would have had a more real edge had it been included (with the exception of a little girl running through a crowd in one scene in a red jacket looking like she'd popped right out of a Butlins advert!)What he's succeeded more in doing is paying homage to those b/w war movies from the late 50s/early 60s,and perhaps added a nice touch of film noir for good measure.As a kid (when I originally saw this film) a film running at nearly three and a quarter hours would have seemed like an eternity,but I must say watching it again today the length did seem to run by comparatively quickly.The film does seem to suffer from a lack of narrative flow,although the actual story remains no less engaging.It is certainly a harrowing account of surely one of the most evil events in human history.We see Jews being treated with less dignity and respect than dogs,and the Nazis certainly put less value on their lives than them.Neeson delivers a commanding central performance as the wartime businessman propelled by his own needs and desires,but offered salvation through his care and concern for the plight of the Jewish people.There's good support,too,from Ralph Fiennes (who would go on to accomplish even bigger and greater things-not including The Avengers!) as the heartless,sadistic Nazi soldier and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's wearisome accountant.Overall,this film doesn't manage to be quite as shocking as it was trying to be by being filmed in black and white (which not everything in life is,anyway!).Senior Spielbergo would go on direct another powerful war film some years later by the name of Saving Private Ryan,which had an unforgettably powerful opening sequence involving the Normandy landings which was filmed in colour and managed to stick in the memory much more prolificly.However,it is gut-wrenching stuff nonetheless and certainly not a film that deserves to be forgotten in a hurry.*****","

"rcj5365","19 June 2009","Any filmmaker who chooses to deal with the Holocaust faces several serious problems. The first is deciding which story to tell. Conventional heroics are impossible;a realistic look at the horror is too appalling. In Thomas Keneally's fact-based novel,Steven Spielburg found the right balance of redemption and sorrow. Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson) is an ambitious businessman who realizes that there is money to be made in war. In a masterful opening montage,Spielburg mixed the forced transfer of Polish Jews to cities after the Nazi occupation with Schindler making his own moves. As families register with bureaucrats who sit at folding tables and make their tidy lists,Schindler matches suits and ties,selects the right cufflinks,and pockets a hefty bankroll. The Jews are forced into their ghetto;Schindler goes to a nightclub where he wines and dines high-ranked Nazis. The two worlds come together when Schindler meets Itzhak Stern(Ben Kingsley)and offers him a deal. Since Jews cannot own businesses,they should work together. Stern's contacts can provide financial banking. Stern himself can provide the expertise to run a business. Schindler will bring ""panache."" ""That's what I'm good at,"" he says. ""Not to work...the presentation.""It may not be a fair deal,but once Schindler signs contracts to provide the Wehrnmacht with cooking utensils,he is able to open an enamelware factory that provides several hundred Jews with jobs. Those jobs,the documentation that goes with them,give the men and women a measure of safety as the Nazis' plans for the ""final solution"" grind inexorably forward to the March 13,1943 liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. That is one of the most harrowing series of scenes ever put on film,and it is matched by the concentration camp sequences that follow. In those scenes of mass chaos and slaughter,Spielburg uses a single spot of color to highlight one little girl. In the black-and-white world,her coat is red. It's almost the same shade as the jacket worn by the young protagonist of Spielburg's Empire of the Sun(1987),in a similar situation when he's alone in a mob and trying to find his way home.In those same scenes,Amon Goeth(Ralph Finnes)is introduced. Goeth is a flabby sociopath who comes to embody the evils of Nazi racism. He is in charge of the camp where the workers are housed and so must be brided and pampered if Schindler is to stay in business. Goeth's excessive cruelty is also part of the reason that Schindler is transformed from war profiteer to crusader. The exact moment of that change is not shown,and it should not be shown. Though popular films are built around such epiphanies,that scene would be out of place in this careful film. Instead,its an accretion of layered awareness that makes Schindler what he becomes. Though Goeth is a selfish,undisciplined man who drinks too much and sleeps with too many women,he is moved by the mounting barbarism,cruelty,and savagery that surrounds him. Neeson's performance is built on a combination of self-confidence,indecision,and doubt. Though some have criticize Steven Zaillian's script on the grounds that it makes Schindler more altruistic than he really was,it does stick closely to historical fact in the numbers of people that Schindler saved from the Holocaust. In the same way,the real Goeth was even more monstrous than he is in the film. But the full scope of his atrocities had been shown,the film would have been unbalanced. As it is,Spielburg pushes the limit,showing as much of the horror as the screen will bear. That horror is alleviated,slightly by Janusz Kaminski's stunning black-and-white cinematography. It gives the violence an abstract,dreamlike quality that no form of color could have matched. He won an Academy Award for his work,and the American Society of Cinematopgraphers placed the film at number five on its best-shot(1950-1997)list. John Williams's somber,almost unoticed score adds the melancholy tone. ""Schindler's List"",also was the overall winner at the Academy Awards. Winning seven Oscars including Best Picture of 1993,as well as Best Director and for Steven Spielburg.Any viewer might be able to find shortcomings somewhere in the collaborative effort,but to what point? Schindler's List demonstrates the potential of Hollywood film-making that is so rarely achieved. When the full financial resources of the industry and best creative people are put in service of an important story,the results can be staggering.","

"Primtime","4 March 1999","I definitely had very high expectations before I watched this film. After all, I was one of the few people that I knew that hadn't seen Schindler's List. Recently, high expectations have been my downfall coming into a film because I expect too much and that is clearly the case here.Sure, this film is very highly regarded and may even go down as the best film of the 90's, however, it didn't blow me away as I expected or show me an aspect of filmmaking that I have never seen before. Spielberg does an incredible job as usual using his keen sense of angles and dimensions that make every scene speak volumes. The cinematography by Janucz Kaminsky captures a lot of the feeling of the second world war, yet it didn't blow me away.I found it interesting that in this film the characters seem to take a secondary role to the setting, history and true story of the Holocaust. Liam Neeson played Schindler well, but did not affect me like other characters in great films. Even Ralph Fienns character was played well but also failed to register as a memorable one.Don't get me wrong, I really liked this film and the message it sends. I don't think this is the best film of the 90's, however, realize that it is still one of the best.9/10 stars.","

"quin1974","29 January 2001","In 1993 I saw this movie in the theater the day it opened here in Holland, and it made such an impact on me that I was afraid to watch it ever since. Now, seven years later, I watched it again, alone, on a saturday night, and again it was one of the most harrowing movie experiences of my life, even on the small screen.This one is up there among other movies about the Holocaust, such as Night and Fog (Resnais, 1956) and Shoah (1985). I think that when you watch these three movies you can catch a glimpse of what these have gone through during WW2, although this of course can never be established through film, this horror.All during this movie you are bombarded in a Spielberg-fashion speed with images that are so gruesome that they bring you on the verge of tears. It was only till the last scene of the real Schindler Jews and the actors laying stones on Schindler's grave that I broke. The music, the imagery, the sensitivity with which Spielberg handled this subject was so convincing and staggering that it truly made me cry. I don't think Spielberg will ever make a more personal movie than this.During the screening I attended seven years ago some people found the imagery too much to handle, and walked out of the theater. It was just too much.I think 1,000 words are not nearly enough to express what I felt and still feel about this movie, so I will just say:If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it. If you've already seen it, vote for it and go see it again.10/10","

"LLAAA4837","8 September 2008","This, to me, is the cruelest film ever made. Sure, there have been many films that have depicted cruelty in it's most realistic and most non discriminating. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL showed us a very true depiction of the holocaust. CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST showed us how far people will go to be known and to be famous. IRREVERSIBLE showed us a nine and a half minute rape scene that is nearly impossible to watch and to sit through without being forever haunted by it. SALO' OR THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM showed us pure innocence being destroyed and defiled by political right-wingers. HAPPINESS showed us how deeply depraved and how inhuman and mentally deformed some seemingly ""normal"" people are. VISITOR Q depicted a family whose members indulge in the most disgusting, horrific, and depraved and don't even seem to know that what they are all doing is wrong. MONSTER was a film in which a prostitute killed her customers, not because she got a thrill out of it, but because society left her no choice. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE depicted a damaged and deranged human mind and then showed us what happens when the body that mind belongs to is no longer able to perform what the mind wants it to. PINK FLAMINGOS shows us two groups of people who act in every bad and evil activity known to mankind, knowing that it's bad and not caring. However, SCHINDLER'S LIST in my opinion, goes even further than all of those films. SCHINDLER'S LIST is a film that all of humanity should be required to watch and sit through. I refuse to watch it again. SCHINDLER'S LIST was a film that affected me so strongly and so deeply that just thinking about it frightens me. I've tried to sit through it a second time and got about halfway through, but I just couldn't handle it and I refused to finish it. SCHINDLER'S LIST is the closest we will ever come to knowing what it was like to be a part of the holocaust. It is among one of the darkest films I've ever seen in my life. The film itself is about Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi party, who owns a company and puts Jews to work in it. However, on the opposite side of the structure we meet a man named Amon Goeth. Goeth is a man who cares so little about the value of human life that he target practices with Jewish people in the Ghetto. To say that the violence in this film is unflinching isn't doing the violence enough justice. We don't watch the violent scenes as much as we full on witness it in at it's angriest and goriest. People are shot in this film. We don't see people firing a gun and then have the camera cut to people falling to the ground. We see people helplessly held at gun to the head and then shot like dogs. We see the blood shoot out very violently and graphically. We see it coat the faces of the victims and the executioners. We see many more horrific things. We see bodies blown apart, tossed aside, and broken apart. We see rotting corpses cooked and we see the remains rain from the sky. We see children get butchered and slaughtered as if their young lives were worthless and expendable. We see it all and we feel helpless. The people who do it don't see anything wrong with doing it and even make games and goofy gestures out of it. Many people will have a difficult time sitting through this film, but it remarkably watchable. As cruel and as brutal and dark and gory as it is, it is a flawless film. The film's ending makes it all worth sitting through. It remains to be one of the most moving and emotional ending in motion picture history. The final thirty minutes are so heart wrenching, honest, beautiful, and strong that it is worth enduring two hours and forty minutes of non-stop cruelty. The ending remains to be the of the great endings in motion picture history. We may not recover from the film, but what we gain from the ending alone makes it all worth defiling your mind.PROS: -Absolutely perfect performances from the entire cast and all speaking parts.-Unflinching and honest depiction of the Nazi Holocaust of the 1940s.-beautiful black & white cinematography.-A true knockout of an ending! CONS: -none","

"mikel weisser","6 May 2002","perhaps it's a clue about the sad state of our world, the inevitability of the holocausts of the past and the holocausts yet to come, that a full half of the films rated higher on the imdb top 250 than this monumental movie celebrate violence and war. blood and death are now and have always been the high art of our greedy raging world. we can pray for the future, but peace can only come true if people are willing to see the world through the vision of justice, respect for humanity and willing to sacrifice so others may live. That is why i suggest the visions of Keneally, spielberg and oskar schindler. this movie is so magnificent from here on out all my grades will go down in perspective. 12 oscar noms, 7 wins (including picture and director), a host of other accolades, all amply deserved. there is just so much to admire: the mix of large scale storytelling with countless smaller story arcs (kudos to  Steven Zaillian's oscar winning adapation of keneally's wondrous novel), hundreds of amazing and daring cinematic touches (set design, cinematography, and editing all also picked up statues) dozens upon dozens of bravura performances, monolithic sets with literal casts of thousands, impressive historical accuracy, the list is near endless, a series of beauties rising into ultimate truth: a film with a soul. perhaps the powerful beauty of this film is that spielberg does not put a hollywood polish on the fact that oskar schindler was a comprised man yet capable of tremendous goodness. in some ways this can be seen as spielberg's first mature film and it's entirely appropriate that this was the first time he collected an oscar after 5 noms. the journalist in me wants to document all the details in this well earned victory, but the humanist in me just wants to thanks everyone involved for the fact it exists. whatever else may be wrong with our planet we can still find hope in the fact that men like schindler are remembered and revered and honored in such an celebrated and immensely popular film. if my words can make you see a film or work for peace, let this one be the one, let now be the time.","

Because it occurred so recently, and was on such a massive scale, it is important we understand it.  Schindler's List is Spielberg's finest hour, the greatest film ever made on the holocaust and the most important movie ever made.  Ever single person should be REQUIRED to see this movie.  It shows the depths that humanity can sink to, the horrors of our race, yet Schindler's List is about survival, about compassion, about the saving of souls, the saving of lives.

"JohnBoyRoy","5 May 2004","I had not seen Schindler's List in it's entirety for a few years.  The last time that I viewed it I was a lot younger and couldn't really digest it's complexities to the full.Of course I was able to appreciate the excellence of it's aethestics and formalities, but it was the great depth to the characters that confused me: when you are younger you view the world in as black and white a vision as this film itself, as everyone knows.I was mesmerised by the performances of Liam ""I'm Retired"" Neeson and Ralph Fienes.Even Neeson's occasionally shaky accent can't hinder the fact that in his character he has realised the ambiguity and hinted capitalist, turned ever so slowly into a humanist by what should have been apparent to him all along - namely the unmotivated slaughter of his workforce.  His motivations change ever so convincingly from money to conscience and by the end of the picture the most moving moment belongs to him and not to the survivors of the terror.Fienes is such a complex character it's untrue.  Spielberg has shot the pair throughout the film as equals-and-not-quite oposites.  They are frequently intercut going through the same actions and mostly in the same space on screen) shot with an equally spaced two-shot.  This brotherhood means that Fienes is hard(er) to detest than you might think.  At times he appears to take on board Schindler's advice and passificity.  He doesn't really hate the Jewish people eiether - he's a massacist, a lover of violence and a generally nasty bloke who just needs an excuse to abuse and kill.  At one point we see him distressed at a gun misfiring again and again - it is not the gun not working, but the fact that his resolve to kill is failing after the first click of the trigger that is distressing him, i feel.  At heart he is a vulnerable coward.The various acts of violence are perfectly integrated into the flow of the picture and therefore as unexpected and unmotivated as their real-life counterparts, unlike Polanski's 'Pianist' in which they were insulting setpieces.Spielberg's film has a much greater feel of authenticity than Polanski's and is much more powerful.  It is full of touches in which you can relate to and understand, moments the summarise the best (and worst) in human nature, whereas the Pianist will feel like just one big cliche of the holocaust, after viewing 'SL'.This really is a powerful film, its just a pity that nobody seems to have learned from what it is based on.8/10","

Liam neeson did a great job as oskar schindler. He played the part excellently.The holocaust is a depressing subject to say the least but what made this film more poignant was that it's based on a true story. The end of the film was extremely moving and the whole film in general was very moving. The lengths he went to to save his workers were amazing.I really liked this film. Its not one id watch all the time but not because i don't like this because its one of them you have to be in the mood for it.Id give this film 9 out of 10. Its a moving film based on a tragic true story. Schindler saved over a thousand people and he was a German who went out of his way. Despite his political beliefs and faults, he did everything he could to save those who worked for him.","

"Stu-5","4 February 1999","This is a film which challenges the human nature. How is the human race capable of such babaricy? Such genocide and mindless, unnecessary slaughter, just because of religion. It makes you sick. Schindler's List is a film which tackles the issues of war, religion and the human spirit with emotion.It revolves around Oskar Schindler, a factory kingpin who, amidst the chaos and slaughter of the war, decides to help the defenceless, enslaved Polish Jews. He makes a list, comprising of 1100 Jewish people, whom he shall liberate and set free. Hence, Schinder's List.Spielberg's direction is first class, and he tells the story with emotion, yet the film is totally in-your-face. One scene which captures the poignancy is where the red dress of a little girl is shown in colour, even though the film is shot in black and white. It sticks out and captures the essence of innocence. A master stroke.I loved the movie because it was so heartfelt and so deliberately graphic, it just stirs so many emotions and shakes the finger at ourselves. It is a brilliant movie.Ten out of ten.","

This is a film you need to see before you die and you will never truly understand the holocaust until you see this film The acting is near enough perfect, the direction is perfect.The poetic image of the girl in the red dress is heart wrenchingly emotional and it presents how much every single one of the Jews suffered in the holocaust.The only problem i have with the movie is that it took a small while to get started and the text at the end is hard to read.In Conclusion, this is a film everyone on the earth should see.

"dkncd","1 December 2007","""Schindler's List"" is Steven Spielberg's acclaimed film that explores the life of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved almost 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust through his actions. Spielberg appropriately decided to make the film in black and white, which gives the film a documentary-like quality. It also allowed him to make effective use of occasional glimpses of color. John Williams again proves his ability to come up with an appropriate soundtrack for any type of film. Spielberg also shows in a time of overwrought special effects that effects can be used subtlety to great effect, such as the zoomed out shot of a building on which windows light up to indicate Nazi gunfire and killings.Liam Neeson is perfect as Oskar Schindler. Schindler is initially a war profiteer who is eventually moved to use his fortune and influence to shield Jews from the Holocaust. Interestingly the character was given an enigmatic quality and generally isn't explicit about his perceptions for a lot of the film. To the film's credit, it doesn't suppress the womanizing aspect of Schindler's character. Ben Kingsley is also excellent in a subtle performance as Schindler's invaluable accountant and assistant, Itzhak Stern. Ralph Fiennes also gives a great and frightening performance as the unstable and insecure megalomaniac Amon Goeth.This film is long and sad, but absorbing at the same time such that it is never tedious during its length of over three hours. The film gains intensity from the graphic depictions of Nazi violence and the lingering sense that Jews can be killed at any time. It also shows us how the courage of one individual can have an important impact. Schindler laments not having saved more people, but the film effectively makes it clear that almost 1,200 people is an important number.","

"zkonedog","7 March 2017","When watching a movie like ""Schindler's List"", there are so many ways that it can be appreciated. It's a history lesson, an intense drama, and a gripping character study all at once. For me, however, the film really hits home with the realization of the difference that one person can make in the grand scheme of things.For a basic plot summary, ""Schindler's List"" focuses on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a high- ranking member of the Nazi party during World War II. When the German Nazis invade Poland and begin rounding up Jews into ghettos, Schindler sees it as strictly a business operation, opening up his own pots-and-pans factory using Jewish labor. While raking in the dough on the backs of the Jews, however, Schindler begins to see the escalating brutality of the Nazis and is eventually appalled by their treatment at the concentration camps. Thus, he creates a list of workers that he ultimately hopes to protect from the brutality.As a history-based epic, ""Schindler's List"" manages to capture the essence of the moment AND yet still be subtle about it at the same time. Director Steven Spielberg strikes the perfect balance between drama and realism. The acting performance from Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi Commandant is especially shocking for its ability to depict the brutality of those camps. Essentially, this is a movie that should be shown to American high school students at least once during their education for its ability to show the true horrors of the holocaust.Perhaps the true hallmark of the movie, though, is the character evolution of Mr. Schindler. He starts off as nothing more than a ruthless businessman, but over time (and it quite literally takes almost every minute of the film's 3+ hour runtime to come to fruition) he begins to realize not only the horrors transpiring around him, but also that he has the power (and thus the responsibility) to do something about it. To me, that was the most endearing message that I took from the overall experience.Thus, I consider ""Schindler's List"" to be a masterpiece of American cinema (although, what should I have expected from Mr. Spielberg?!). It is compelling on both a historic and personal level simultaneously. Even though it is quite long, there are very few wasted moments.","

"hunnam55","11 May 2004","This film is a beauty in itself. All this happend during the second world-war. The poor Jews were killed and brutally murdered in the most places of Europe by the Nazi-people. This film is located round a German man by the name Oscar Schindler who tried for 110% to save as many jews as possible. You follow his vision about this, and lot's of disgusting things happens on his way to the Jewish freedom. Schindler's list is a film that everybody Should see, even though you like or dislike films like this one. ALL of these sequences is based on TRUE story, and has got some reflections in the Middle-east situation today. That the jews always has been a hunted people.You really Should see this film.

"pinbyte","13 March 2007","I dare not rate this film but only give some thoughts. If I was watching it to be entertained, it would receive a negative number. If I was watching it strictly with a critical eye as to judge if it is a well made film, I might have to give it an 11. Be it contrivance or not, this is the most powerful and disturbing film I have ever experienced.The violent and disturbing scenes depicted in this film are based in fact. They are recent history for that matter. That makes it very hard to endure. And worse, the inhumanity of genocide continues to this very day. I have little doubt that the scenes depicted in this film are tame compared to the realities of what occurred at Krakow and elsewhere.The film brought me there convincingly, and the pain was there. It was hard to watch, and disturbing as I ponder that at any moment a political tide might derail my own life.There are characters that kill for sport. But these are not characters. These are characterizations of real evil people that recently existed, recreated in the film based on the recollections of those who have witnessed the atrocities. Then there is Schindler, who is not characterized as sweet, but as a unique person who will not trade inhumanity for money. It is quite an intriguing story.On one hand, I say this movie should be seen by every human being on the planet. On the other hand, I have found that this movie has brought within me a feeling of depression that is long lasting. For sure, we must not forget the Holocaust. With a revived knowledge of this history from viewing this film my eyes will be more open.I could have spent my time more enjoyably. But this well-made film has a reason to exist. You won't care unless you watch it. Yet, you will pay the price whether or not you are indifferent to the messages in this film. You will never forget it.I propose that is the point of it.","

"axile007","17 January 2010","Schiendler's List is about a German Oskar Schiendler who in his own way tried to rescue thousand of Jews workers from Nazis.And the tool he used to help them is his wealth.Now I wont say much about story,because no doubt Schiendler's list is an epic from Mr.Spielberg and whatever anyone says,you should just watch this movie.I just did not feel anything while watching it..I mean it so well directed and dialogues are very clear. Well critics rating and its ranking speaks very much about it.We have seen many movies about Nazis hatred for jews, including some really good movies like The downfall(2004),Inglorious Bastards(2009) and many more,but this movie is different..because it shows how a man can help others,if he wants to while remaining in his limits & working under constraints. Schiendler's list emphasize on this aspect of the story.Watch the movie from the view of a person who tried to maintain his position within Nazi and help his so-called enemies in the process.From that point you will really appreciate the movie.","

"jrb1802","25 October 2000","I dont mind admitting it. I am a 30-year old man, who saw this film at the cinema when it first came out. I was 24 then, and only one other film had ever made me cry (David Lean's Elephant Man). But this film got to me. Even now when I see it on Video, it still brings a lump to my throat. The cast are wonderful in the movie. What a good actor Ralph Fiennes is. They say if an actor playing a bad guy, can truly make his audience hate him, he has a gift for acting. Well, I truly hated Fiennes at the end of this movie. Not the man himself, of course, but the evil German Nazi he was playing, Amon Goertz. Having seen a documentary on Schindler a few weeks after the movie came out, Fiennes also chillingly looks like the real Goertz.**** SPOILERS AHEAD... DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THE FILMThe film was shot in Black and White, to add an eerily atmosphere, which made it look more realistic. But the bit I broke down to at the cinema, was the young girl that you spot in the Red Coat, running away with the rest of the people. Then a few scenes later, as the Germans are pouring the bodies of Jews into the mass Burial hole, you see the girl in the red coat come out of the wheelbarrow and into the pit. This was too much for my Girlfriend, who left the cinema. Also the ending where Schindler is apologizing to Stern for not saving more Jews was quite moving.I remained in my seat, alone, and just watched as the real survivors of the holocaust, and the actors that played them were led to Schindler's Grave to lay a stone. And then the final bit where you dont actually see him, but Neeson lays a flower on the grave of the hero he had just portrayed - and so convincingly. In years to come when Speilberg is long gone, I believe he`ll best be remembered for several films: Jaws, Back to the Future, Saving Private Ryan, Jurassic Park and this one.10/10.",NA
"johnnyboyz","25 October 2010","Schindler's List begins with the striking of a match and the consequent lighting of a candle in a small room; an action which illuminates the rest of the locale and sheds light on those in the form of people and items around it. Steven Spielberg's film is a piece which goes on to shed degrees of light on a man, whose titular list and what it incurs, is the harrowing but brutally honest subject for this three hour true-to-life experience. Shot in black and white amongst deathly downcast greys which combine brilliantly with chillingly cold white in the form of snow and general skyline, Schindler's List unfolds amidst a bleak time of murder and pillage but will go on to focus on a ray of hope or salvation in the form of Nazi businessman Oskar Schindler; specifically, his work on the Eastern Front during World War 2 that saw him save and aid a vast number of Jewish people destined for slaughter.Liam Neeson plays the man, a factory owner of Czech origin living in the year 1939 about embark on a period of six or so years which will change his life and many of those he comes to interact with, forever. When we first encounter Oskar, he neatly lays his shirts out across a bed during preparation for an evening out; his room neat and very formal, large sums of spare money sitting idly in a nearby draw for whatever reason suggesting a rich or high lifestyle. The measure of the man in his charismatic abilities is are established when Schindler arrives at an function in the evening full of German Nazi officials; light entertainment in the form of cabaret as well as food and drink which is already flowing. When he first enters, very few people seem to know of him, but by the end of the evening he appears to have wedged himself in amongst everybody as the centre of attention and entertainment. At a function in which all of the other Nazi officials seem greyed out by the, Schindler comes to have a white ray of light fly over his face suggesting there's a little more to this man than just mere self-indulgence and death.Schindler's goals are entirely infused with tendencies that veer towards Capitalism, his dealing with the Nazi party officials see him enter a business proposition that'll have him enter with nothing but come away with a great deal of something. The situation as to whether we are on the side of Oskar in the initial stages is additionally challenged when it transpires if The War were to end, Schindler's enterprise might falter so the longer that most of the activity happening in and around everybody at this time continues, it's going to be pretty good for business. Inbetween all of this, The Second World War reaches somewhat of an infamous crescendo in and around the locality of Central Europe; The Holocaust causing widespread Jewish demotion into set Ghettos, later followed by evacuations leading onto murder for them but a severe clashing of morality for Schindler whom comes to realise employing these proverbial lambs to the slaughter would go a long way in saving them.The film is a high end piece of drama, balancing a character's gradual struggle with being able to offer salvation really well with its meshing of the war genre. Spielberg's gradual dragging of his lead away from a self-obsessed businessman always looking out for ways to make money out of the system into this mournful, regretful man makes for wonderful viewing. By the time he is weeping, towards the end, at what has happened or more importantly what hasn't happened in the saving of more Jewish people, we feel the need to weep with him - thus successfully aligning the audience with this figure whom was once how he was in his indulgent, Nazi function attending self. The comparison is somewhat bookended very simply in how it is both Schindler as a stand alone man and how the Nazis as a collective group go about the employment of the Jews and the manner in which they treat them in a physical sense. Where Schindler will come to offer hope and salvation in the shape of factory employment, regardless of ability or handicap, an early scene will see German soldiers ruthlessly eliminate an elderly man because of his inability to successfully carry out what it is they ask of him through their charging him with a task, namely, the shovelling away of snow so as to clear a public road.Schindler comes to stand in direct opposition to a fearsome Nazi Captain of the S.S. named Amon Göth (Fiennes), Göth additionally being based on a true to-life individual. Like Schindler, Göth is running a business or operation in which management and organisation are key; but while both members of the Nazi party and sharing similar basic ingredients as to their respective action plans, the men couldn't be any further apart in character. Göth arrives on the scene, a Kraków suburb called Płaszów, to help in the construction of a new concentration camp; the house on the hill he's charged with living in a dominant position in which he is able to overlook all of his work – construction orientated or otherwise. Just as Schindler goes out of his way to 'select' an aide or assistant in the form of Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern, Göth himself goes through a similar process of 'selecting' a assistant he renders a maid-come-slave in the form of a young Jewish woman. The measure of Fiennes' performance as Göth is highlighted in his ability to have the motivational ""tonight is history"" monologue prior to a ghetto liquidation come across as just as chilling as the act of liquidation itself. The film is an exhausting watch; an enthralling character study set amidst dark and desperate times as a man's shifting viewpoints play out.",NA

The resounding performances, the emotional score, the visceral and beautiful direction, the landslide powerhouse cinematography and so the list forever goes on. Spielburg has crafted a masterpiece that sculpulates the granger, the brutality and sadness of the Holocaust. Only one kind of director could have designed and re-shaped the emotionalness, the stomach-churning violence and a cascading event that will forever stay embedded in our minds. That director was Steven Spielburg.The story, though simplistic, is told in a profound vision that one could only feel like they were there, and Spielburg creates this perfectly.The story is as follows: Oskar Schindler uses Jews to start a factory in Poland during the war. He witnesses the horrors endured by the Jews, and starts to save them.The way the whole film is shot is only part of it's magnificence, but Spielburg provides substance and deep methodic styles to accompany this with.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes all provide magnificent and powerful performances that only when thinking about it resembles the motives and detail of the characters that are so boldly and tightly-suited to perfection.The decision to put the film in black and white is exactly true to the time and places that the film took place around.The backdrops and cold baron Polish wastelands show the best cinematography from Spielburg.Verdict:A phenomenal account of ones mans passion for saving not one life, but many.

"kyle-cruse","16 September 2008","Currently hailed as one of the top ten films of all time, ""Schindler's List"" remains an amazing story depicting the persecution of the Jews during the Holocaust. If you ask me, the film is not truly about the Jews themselves. For me, the main part of this film deals with the man Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson, in what is possibly his best role) and the life change he endures by deciding to help out the Jews. He begins as a selfish man using the Jews to work for him so he can make a profit. As a result, he pays to save the Jews from Hitler's persecution so he can use them to work for him instead. A large number of Jews end up on his list (the list of the title) and come to work for him. By the end, however, he sees what he has done for them and wishes he had been less selfish and could have spent more of his money (which he now sees as worthless) to save the lives of more of the Jews. The scene in which he realizes this is my personal favorite scene of the film. This is where the movie is at. It makes us all wish we could do more to help. At over three hours long, this film can prove to be a bit long and slow at times, which is really the only reason I cannot call it perfect. Nevertheless, everything about the movie is perfectly well done. The depictions are very realistic and the acting is brilliant. Spielberg pulls it off once again. Hard to say if this should be the Best Picture of 1993, though. ""The Fugitive"" is my personal favorite movie and I would have liked that to win. Of course, it is a film like ""Schindler's List"" that truly deserves a Best Picture Oscar. Not one of the top ten of all time for me, but a must see for all.***1/2 out of ****",NA
"stefanbe","16 July 2007","The medium of film can be used to present both fact and fiction, with realistic portrayals of historical events littered in the multiplex among the fantasy adventures. Steven Spielberg is renowned for his special effects-laden blockbusters, but even more so for his World War II epics that are meant more to inform and remember rather than to entertain. His most accomplished film is Schindler's List, based on the true story of a man who saved over a thousand Jews from extermination. Those renting the DVD just to have a fun time would be best to look elsewhere. Those who are looking to view a perfect take on a very depressing time in European history will find it in Schindler's List. This is not Oscar bait, like so many people claim it to be. This is a upsetting and heart-wrenching motion picture that is sure to bring some people to tears. With an excellent cast, a beautiful score and harrowing camera-work, Schindler's List succeeds on so many levels.Set in Poland during World War II, the film centers on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a member of the Nazi Party who wishes to open a pots and pans factory in Krakow. Due to Jewish workers being much cheaper than Poles, he hires an accountant called Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help roll up Jews to work in the factory. Soon, more and more of them are hired and while Schindler originally saved the Jews for profit, now he wants to save them from being gassed in the concentration camps. Meanwhile, Schindler meets Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), a Nazi soldier who takes pleasure in shooting Jews. However, he also has a relationship with Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), a Jewish woman who is sometimes abused, but also sometimes loved by Goeth. These two stories are also connected with those of the prisoners in the Ghettos and concentration camps, who are hired and saved by Schindler.The images of Schindler's List are very depressing and upsetting, but it could not have worked any other way. Spielberg portrays Nazi-occupied Poland accurately and thus, it's quite possibly one of the saddest films ever made. It's not an easy film to watch, but it should certainly be mandatory viewing. Schindler's List is not just a movie, it's a call for an end to prejudice. The Holocaust was one of the most horrific events of the twentieth century and it is perfectly filmed by director of photography Janusz Kaminski. The majority of the film is in black-and-white, a very intelligent decision on Spielberg's part, which actually makes the film look more realistic than if it was entirely in colour. Many scenes, including one involving a jammed gun, make us stop and think that maybe we shouldn't take things for granted. Steven Zaillian's screenplay is tight and manages to portray these real-life people very well with excellent dialogue. In addition, John Williams' score adds even more heartbreak to this tremendous film.Yet, it is the actors who truly sell the film. Liam Neeson shows plenty of range as a man, who starts off as greedy and only looking for profit and then slowly changes into a hero. Schindler is a man who wants to make money, but also wants to save lives and Neeson perfectly shows a man who can't have his cake and eat it, too. Ben Kingsley gives very subtle work as Stern, a man who is in two worlds: that of the ghettos and concentration camps and then working alongside a man who can save his fellow Jews. While Schindler is giving him instructions, we see that Stern is secretly pulling the strings as much as he can. Finally, Ralph Fiennes truly shows that he is one of Britain's finest young actors with his role as the ruthless Goeth. We see in his eyes a man who is not ""just following orders"" like some Nazis were at the time, but really somebody who does believe a lot in Der Führer's evil ideas. Fiennes portrays his love for Hirsch very well, showing him at a crossroads. On the one hand, he hates Jews and believes them to be scum, but on the other, he has a deep admiration for Helen. Yet, he feels he must show his meaner side to the follow soldiers. Fiennes not only shows an evil man, but a man truly in love as well.Steven Spielberg is the master behind this brilliant production and everything about it is composed so well. He proved with this film that he has the ability to direct serious, dramatic films and this is the film that most people will view him upon. It is the story of triumph and how if you try, you can help save the world and lead to the end of racism and violence. After all, as the Talmud says, ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire."" This quote can be applied to people of all religions, not just those who Oskar Schindler saved years ago. That is what Schindler's List is most of all about: the fight against bigotry and injustice.",NA
"cdjh-81125","1 December 2016","Steven Spielbergs ""Schindlers List"" is all but considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time and I can hardly disagree with such a statement because this is an incredible film that isn't always easy to watch but is the peak of writing, directing and acting. Liam Neeson and Oskar Schindler gives the greatest performance of his entire career in this film, Neeson brings a complexity to his character and a captivating nature to Schindler, Spielberg doesn't try to paint Schindler as a hero he builds him up as a man in an impossible situation trying to complete a mission he believes in and he has some truly amazing scenes with his ""power"" monologue being possibly one of my all time favourite movie moments. Neeson also has some truly astonishing scenes with Ralph Fiennes who is absolutely incredible in this movie not only is he a completely terrifying presence but Fiennes is able to turn him into a sick human being which makes him much more interesting to watch. Like I said this film is a hard watch at times but that's ultimately one of the films greatest strengths, that it refuses to glorify the holocaust and this film has some truly disgusting moments that gives you a hint at the naive nature of humans themselves. Of course John Williams scored this film and he composed one of his finest achievements for this film. Spielberg added a very personal touch to this film with the know iconic girl in the red coat, it's a moment that is chilling to begin with but almost goes completely over your head afterwards but it's truly horrifying when it comes back later on and gives you an impression that truly nobody was safe from the grip of the Nazis. While Neeson was the one who turned Schindler into such a captivating protagonist it was also the excellent writing that made his character worth watching, he at first comes across as a complete bastard but once he gradually changes his ways it feels earned and you understand the heartbreak that Schindler goes through when he begins to realise that he may not have done enough. This film is very iconic for the fact that it was completely shot in Black and White and that's because it works so well, it gives the film and documentary style that makes it feel real. Schindlers List is a masterpiece it's has such a captivating look at humanity, it refuses to show events any way other than how they happened. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes give the greatest performances of their entire careers in this film and in my opinion should have both received Oscars for their work. A+/100%",NA
"kbouck","5 July 2000","Believe it or not...I rented this movie back in 93 or 94 when it was first released, and didnt understand much of it and didnt even watch all of it. I turned it off out of boredom and confusion. At that time I knew nothing about WWII, nor did I really care.Lately, I have been reading alot about WWII,Hitler,Himmler, and have been reading survivor stories from concentration camp survivors, particularly Auschwitz. I have also read many stories on the other concentration camps, and have come across many more stories of camp and ghetto survivors, and have read them all with sadness, but with interest. I have even had the pleasure of corresponding with an Auschwitz survivor and Schindlers List seems VERY realistic as to what actually happened in the camps and ghettos.The movie is very easy to understand if you have basic knowledge of WWII and the holocaust. Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, a NAZI businessman who wants to hire some camp jews as cheap slave labor to work for him (as many many companies did back then). These people that work for him are treated with a little respect and given decent working conditions. Soon many other Jews are depserate to work for him, as they realise that could mean they will not die in the camps. Oskar starts to get extremely irritated when he learns that the evil camp SS Amon Goeth (played by Ralph Fiennes) is killing many of his workers without good cause and wants the killings to stop. He then finds out that many of his workers will be sent to Auschwitz, where death is almost certain, unless something is done. He then uses his power and money to bribe many high ranking Nazi officials to bringing his workers to another country via train to have them work in a plant, where they will be saved from execution. Although he loses just about everything in the process, saving the lives of more than 1000 Jews proved worth it in the end, afterall, ""You save one life...you save the world entire."" I was surprised they even threw in a small role of the ""Angel of Death"", the evil Dr. Josef Mengele, who basically was responsible for the death of many many Jews, via the gas chamber, and his horrible, cruel,useless experiments. He was the one at Auschwitz who walked around determining who was fit to work, and who should die. If you were an older person, sick, weak,or had a small child, you were most likely sent to the gas chamber.This is an outstanding movie and I'm very glad I rented it. I highly recommend it to everyone. Kudos to Steven Speilberg for this masterpiece.",NA

Oskar met with Stern, Jewish accountant, to help him deal with all paper work and over period of time got a real friendly and cared for him as friend. After almost two hours of pure torture, horror, sadness and pain there come a hope as Oskar wan't to save as much as possible Jews from being sent to Auschwitz and he even bribes others to help him execute plan. After train with men came it was surreal but seemed like it will happen and then it did train with women was sent by mistake to Auschwitz and it kept breaking heart from moment to moment with a great of pain and horror. After realizing that Oskar went everywhere and demanded them back and thankfully he managed to correct that. SS surrenders and factory scene is so heartfelt and satisfying. Oskar was forced to leave and in his way to car he just emotionally falls apart and starts to talk about saving even more Jews.

"dee.reid","15 December 2008","Filmmaker Steven Spielberg's 1993 World War II/Holocaust drama ""Schindler's List"" is a cinematic triumph. Unquestionably Spielberg's most ""satisfying"" film about WWII (and of his career, perhaps), ""Schindler's List"" is one of his many directorial highlights because of its message of hope, survival, and humanity during a time in human history that lacked any of those three. This is what Spielberg's vision of World War II was really about: regaining a sense of hope, survival, and humanity in grave times.It's been a while since I saw it last. I saw this film about six years ago my sophomore in high school; we had to watch it as part of my world history class. Boy, am I glad I chose to show up those two days we watched this movie because I surely would have missed out on an incredible film experience. This is my favorite film about the Holocaust during World War II; ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) was pure fun about World War II, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) showed the personal cost of World War II.Spielberg is himself a Jew, and his personal feelings about WWII and the plight of the Jews during that time are no secret to anyone who watches his movies about that period in time; has anyone got the feeling he was secretly smirking to himself when Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) was making mincemeat out of those b******s, the Nazis, in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark?"" I do. ""Schindler's List"" is Spielberg's masterstroke of cinematic film-making. If ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" showed a Jewish kid vicariously living out his fantasies of slaying Nazis, then ""Schindler's List"" showed us that that kid has finally grown up.Adapted from Thomas Keneally's book, this heartfelt - and oft-times horrifying - tale is about a German war profiteer named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who gives safe haven to over 1,000 Jews (including his loyal accountant, Itzhak Stern, played by a superb Ben Kingsley) in his factory after becoming sensitive to the horrors inflicted upon them by the Nazis, especially by the psychopathic, high-ranking Nazi commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). By no means a saint, his transformation from womanizing war profiteer who thought nothing of socializing with the Nazis to humanitarian savior is nothing short of a brilliant performance by Neeson, who gives this at-first loathsome character a heart and a human portrayal who risked bankruptcy and certain death to ""Save one Life, and save the World Entire.""What's most striking about this production is its authenticity. Spielberg filmed ""Schindler's List"" at the real Nazi concentration at Auschwitz - just to give it that extra-real feeling of authenticity. To make the film fit the time, he chose to film it in black & white, much rather than the easier color print. However, when color does appear in one particular key scene, you get why Spielberg chose to put it there. There's also something so real and believable about the concentration camp scenes that make the imagery during those sequences unforgettable. Who can forget the startling sequences where the Nazis are making the Jewish prisoners strip in freezing-cold weather, and then herd them into darkened rooms where ominous-looking sprinklers loom overhead?""Schindler's List"" is one of the key films about World War II, the Holocaust, and of the 20th century; maybe it's the definitive film about those three. Its historical significance will allow it to never become dated, and will make it one of the best films in the history of cinema. Steven Spielberg probably has, indeed, made the most satisfying film of his career.10/10",NA
"rsabnis1","15 June 2013","Schindler's List (1993), directed by the most acclaimed director Steven Spielberg is the most touching and fascinating movie Hollywood ever witnessed. The movie has Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes playing the key roles in the film. Spielberg demonstrates his creative genius by taking the audience back into the era regarded as the worst period in the history of mankind, the Holocaust. The protagonist Oskar Schindler, played quite beautifully by Liam Neeson is a true Nazi gentleman having a taste for women, liquor and money. A sense of confidence is reflected in the eyes of Oskar as he goes on to establish an enterprise having Jews as the manual labourers. It was the time when Jew labour was considered to be the cheapest and it seemed perfect for Oskar to make a successful business. He appoints a Jew manager by the name Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) who once ran a factory in the Cracow ghetto. Stern does the job of recruiting Jew labour while Schindler takes care of the flamboyance (that is what he claims he is good at). The work of running a labour camp in Paszów is entrusted to Amon Goeth, a ruthless Nazi general. The Krakow ghetto is liquidated and numerous Jews are sent to allocate in the labour camps where innocent Jews are shot in cold blood by Amon for no reason and just to fulfill his immoral satisfaction. As the film progresses, a gradual change in Oskar Schindler takes place. The person who used to think only about his enterprise and the profits associated with it starts feeling a concern and a sense of sadness for the devastated Jews. The audience can literally sense the humanitarian nature evolved in Oskar Schindler. The name 'Schindler's List' pertaining to the list which Oskar prepares to bring in thousands of Jews into his company thereby freeing them from the clutches of Amon. Spielberg creates an artistic feel as the movie is shot in black and white and the viewer gets himself time-travelled in the past. The movie ends with Schindler saving more than thousand Jews thus stopping paving a way for another world. The film has a very pertinent dialogue quoted by Stern. He says ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire"". A Big salute to Spielberg and this masterpiece... Nudity: Yes Kissing: Mild Foul Language: No Blood and Gore:Yes",NA
"KGitt44498","12 March 2004","Schindler's List (I affectionately call it ""Swindler's List"" sometimes) has great acting in a great semi-fact-based story. Liam Neeson's acting was ""Oskar"" nominated, but Ralph Fiennes was super as Goeth, and Kingsley was excellent as well.Some great cinematography too - the candle smoke cutting to the train smoke, for one (somewhat like TE Lawrence blowing out the match then cut to desert sunrise, or ""2001"" bone to spaceship cut) and any of dozens of other haunting images.Schindlers's List has some excellent dialog. Some examples are when Schindler talks to Goethe about ""power"", or Stern talking about the list being ""absolute good"", or Schindler crying because he could have saved more people by giving away his Nazi pin or other personal items.Sentimental? Maybe. Many Spielberg movies are too sappy for me, but this was not. Gloss over low-lights of Schindler himself? Probably. Doesn't really matter, though.Not many ""better"" movies out there.",NA
"MA$E","16 August 1998","Some people consider this a war film. I consider it a classic. When I saw this film for the first time I really felt bad about what happened to people during the war. I was happy that this film was shot in black and white because some of the gore I probably couldn't stand in color. Spielberg has definitely surpassed his Jurassic Park stage and moved on to better work like this or Amistad. I cant wait to see his new movie Saving Pvt. Ryan because it is also about WWII. If you watch this whatever your age it will effect like no other film can.",NA
"iamsam103","2 May 2004","well I have only just seen this film recently due to the new DVD. I was in a way reluctant to watch it as so many people have said how sad it is and the fact that it is in black and white doesnt really appeal to me. But once I sat myself down and switched it on I was very suddenly intrigued by the amount of detail and hard work put into this film. Liam Neeson and Ben Kinglsey are the 2 main stars of this film and carry it very well whereas Ralph Feinnes delivers a shocking and scary performance. it pleased me to see his come-upance at the end.I have to say that I have never cried during a film, never in my life. But towards the end of this film there was a lump in my throat and its true to say that i wasnt choaking on pop-corn. If a film is based on a point in history and is being made by a very talented director and has the certificate of a 15 or an 18 then it has no boundaries and this film is one of them. This is how this film carries itself into my top 10 list. It shows how horrifically the Jews were treated and how it turned into 2 mens struggle to save as many as they possibly could. The end where all the victims of the Nazi's ways placed a stone on Oscar Schindler's grave is extrememly touching and is a perfect end to an excellent film. Too bad Speilberg doesnt make films like this these days...now we're given A.I and Minority Report...such a shame",NA
"TheMovieeGuy","4 March 2004","I distinctly remember seeing Schindler's List in a darkened theater during my last year attending the University of Southern California, back in late 1993. The buzz about this film was astounding. Fresh from directing the summer 1993 box office smash, Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg was about to completely abandon the famous popcorn movie for which he was so well known to take on one of the darkest chapters of the 20th century, the holocaust. Many critics doubted that Spielberg was up to the task of directing such a dark moment in human history.This film is by far Spielberg's best dramatic film, this and Saving Private Ryan proves beyond any doubt that Spielberg is more than capable of directing a powerful dramatic film as well as other great directors like Martin Scorese and Francis Ford Coppola. His use of black and white only illustrates how great and mature a storyteller he has become in recent years.The 11 years since it's release has deminished it's impact on society, but let no one forget the haunting images of this masterpiece.The DVD looks completely amazing with terrific digital clarity, and great sound. Unforunately, as with Spielberg's other films on DVD, this one has no director's commentary whatsoever.This is defintely the best film of the 1990's and winner of seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Oscar worth performances from Liam Neeson, Ben Kingley, and of course, the memorable Ralph Fiennes!This haunting film also proves without a doubt that Spielberg is one of the best directors to ever work in Hollywood!",NA
"dimitrisalomao","24 March 2010","""Schindler's List"" is the kind of movie that, because of its historical accuracy, could be used as a documentary. But it also gives us a deep story, and a performance by Liam Neeson, that is among the best of all time.The movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler (Neeson), a vain, glorious and greedy German businessman who becomes unlikely humanitarian amid the barbaric Nazi reign when he feels compelled to turn his factory into a refuge for Jews. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp.Steven Spielberg has a technical talent like no one else has. His frames are so elegant and objective, that you know what is going on, and where (in the last battle of ""Saving Private Ryan"" you can notice this qualities better), which makes us feel that we are living the movie. The massacres and killing scenes are distressing, because it looks like it's happening to you. And the idea of making this movie black and white gives a tone of reality, that looks like the movie was shot during WWII.The plot, beyond giving us a history lesson, shows the amazing story of Orkar Schindler, whose personality and turns are probably the best thing in the movie, and powered by Liam Neeson's incredible and contained performance, that is just one of the best. And other great characters, Ben Kingsley as Stern, as the smart, but quiet Jew, Fiennes as Goeth, the obsessed with power German (Although I thought it was exaggerated sometimes, like when he wakes up, and shoot Jews with a rifle, just for fun). And the construction of the characters is very well made, which makes the ending even more powerful, being one of the most moving scenes in the history of cinema.Verdict: Probably Spieberg's best work, with a moving and accurate story, and a mesmerizing performance by Liam Neeson, this movie is simply, one of the best.",NA
"kitsuyuutsu","3 November 2017","There are a lot of negative reviews on here... Most of those focus on the fact that Nazis weren't as bad as how they depict them. I suppose that's a matter of opinion. And, as we know, opinions are like assholes, everyone's got one. Honestly, the fact that they exterminated so many people (and not just Jews) because they felt them to be ""inferior"" doesn't make Nazis all sunshine and rainbows. Were they an efficient society? Yes. Did that make them superior to people of other faiths or races? No. No matter how you look at it, everyone has their own definition of good and evil and levels thereof. It all depends on your point of view. And how Spielberg views exactly how evil he felt the Nazis were should not be the sole basis of a movie review. My apologies to those who think otherwise. Now, as for the movie itself, it is a bit dark and depressing. But then again, the real life events weren't like a Club Med vacation. If you know anything about this particular period of time, you shouldn't expect cheerful. If that's what you want, go watch something else. My son watched this in history class in high school (I had to sign a permission slip because of the nudity and content). When he saw it was on one of the movie channels a year later, he told me I should watch it, that it was such a good movie. Now... my kid loves video games and Pokemon. That's pretty much it. He hates to read and hates historical anything. So when he said it was good and I should watch it, I knew I had to see it. I must admit, I was engrossed from the beginning. I had never heard of Oskar Schindler before this movie (when I was in high school, they didn't delve much into WWII) and I found his story fascinating. He risked a lot to save the lives of a lot of people. Whether or not he profited from this financially or not is kind of irrelevant. What's most important is that he wanted to save lives when the rest of the Nazis wanted to kill them all off. And the very fact that these people, who are shown at the end honoring his grave, shows me they held him in high regard, which I found moving. And I'm not easily moved. From an artist aspect, I think this was very well done. The use of black and white was quite appropriate for the content and also allowed for the few splashes of color to help the viewer focus on something important you may not have noticed otherwise, like the little girl in the red coat. As for people who complained about Spielberg... You may not think this his best movie or some sappy piece of fluff he cranked out. For those who felt that way, I'd like to ask that you go read some of the trivia items. He doesn't get a dime from this movie. He wants everything he could get donated. Mind you, he could have just donated a chunk of money, but this was obviously something he felt strongly about. I consider that to be more than admirable.",NA
"josh-hall","10 June 2005","Some films i feel you can watch and just think there is something wrong and you don't really feel anything from it. There is nothing that shocks you whether it be the story or the acting. Schindlers list is one of those films like a lot of other Spielberg greats (Saving Private Ryan,Jaws)really grips you.This is probably the most powerful epic of any historical event ever made. Everything about it is perfection for a good movie. From the incredible performances by Liam Neeson as Oskar who i felt had deserved an academy award more than any actor alive for his performance and also for Ralph Feinnes as a terrifying Nazi and Ben Kingsleyalso gives another memorable performance as Jewish factory worker Izthak Stern right to the dazzling cinematography (the film was shot in an amazing black and white style to give it a more historical and realistic look). I think my favourite scene of the film has to be at the beginning when you see the all the Jews being evacuated and terrorised by German soldiers and then suddenly a little girl appears in a red dress which is the only coloured part of the film. That to me is shot that will go down in movie history.Many people believe that Spielberg is the kind of guy who is always going to be remembered for masterpieces like E.T,Jaws and the Indy trilogy. In my opinion this is the film where we knew that Spielberg was right next to Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee was one of todays greatest living directors.",NA
"SimonL","18 November 1998","Schindler's List is truly one of the most thought provoking films of the decade. Before seeing this film, I knew nothing about the horrors of the Holocaust, and to be honest, I wish that were still the case.I cannot believe the sheer brutality of the Germans for committing such horrific acts on the Jews. Just because a person has a different religion or race to our own, does that give us any right to crucify them or make them feel less human?With regards to the film, expert performances, especially from Neeson, Kingsley and Feinnes, combined with the superb cinematography of Janusz Kaminski and direction of Spielberg make Schindler's List an enduring, although disturbing, masterpiece.",NA
"R_Alex_Jenkins","12 December 2011","This was originally a nine-out-of-ten film for me, but I'm giving it a TEN just to counteract the incredibly negative opinions of those people giving it 1 or 2.The film has some flaws and feels very engineered in places, such as the campy scene at the beginning when Schindler strolls up stairwells unhindered like a God, entering into an office full of neatly organised desks and orderly queues when in reality everyone is in utter panic, which is a little unrealistic and cheesy. And the bit where fat, naked old ladies are running around the concentration camps, cutting to scenes of extremely skinny men being examined, then cutting back to those fatty ladies running around. Poor selection of extras.However, none of these criticisms can take away the pure mesmerizing watchability of this film. I've seen it three of four times and will certainly watch it several more times before I die. Even if you don't like the film, it's still so well filmed, researched, acted and directed that it deserves at least 5 or 6, even if you hate the sometimes corny Spielberg take on it.A TEN out of ten for entertainment from me.",NA
"cricketbat","1 September 2023","When Steven Spielberg created Schindler's List, he made a film that is horrible, yet beautiful. It's impossible to look away at the atrocities happening on the screen, but what makes it even more awful is knowing these things happened in the real world. This is not a film that I can watch on a regular basis because it breaks my heart, weighs me down, and haunts me after every viewing. Each actor's performance, along with the carefully crafted filmmaking seems to be done with a sense of reverence to the real-life events. Schindler's List is an essential film. Everyone should watch it at least once.",NA
"MightyGorga","27 July 2000","This film is almost too poignant to put into words.  Liam Neeson creates a Schindler who is simultaneously a deeply flawed and compassionate man - in other words, a real, fully rounded human being, one of the best portrayals in motion picture history.  Also sublime are Ben Kingsley as Stern, Schindler's bookkeeper and confidante, and Ralph Fiennes, whose Amon Goeth reminds us just how dark and twisted the human soul can become.  No film has ever done better at capturing the depth of suffering that was the Holocaust. A work of genius - easily the finest film of the 1990s, and one of the greatest ever.",NA
"GEM-20","1 February 2005","What I am about to say may seem absurd, yet it is the truth from my heart. There are movies that everyone should see, yet one viewing would suffice. There are films that have such powerful messages, with images that are beyond words. They are burned into your consciousness forever.""Schindler's List"" is such a film. It remains Steven Spielberg's finest achievement. In fact, it is the greatest accomplishment in cinema. Eleven years after seeing the film, portions still linger in my mind's eye.Obviously, a film like this can never be matched. Spielberg never tried to. He let it speak for itself.These days, with the advent of DVDs and high-definition screens, I have never felt totally compelled to buy ""Schindler's List"" on disc. Perhaps I should, and maybe I will. It's not that I do not want to see the movie again, and it is certainly not that I think it is a bad film.The truth is that it so conveys its message so powerfully, it succeeds at what it is trying to do in ways that words cannot describe.Out of four stars, I rate this one *****. That's right, even four stars are not adequate.George",NA
"UnknownRealmsDotNet","27 August 2012","Holocaust stories aren't watched for entertainment. They are more for documentation, more for knowledge. So it is no wonder this film clocks in at over 3 hours long, because like most holocaust stories, Schindler's List was made to be evidence to those not born in the time of that tragic and horrific event, not for a jaunty, fun watch. Here, Spielberg weaves in the tragedies of the holocaust with an engaging story, balancing both perfectly, delivering enough plot to make you wonder what will happen next, and enough tragedy to make you appreciate what you have now. While there is much that is done to perfection in SL, it is the visuals that are the most memorable. Kaminski's spot on cinematography and the choice to shoot this in black and white brings frame after frame of picture perfect visuals, reminiscent of classics such as Casablanca. In addition to that, the performances are memorable for almost every performer. Neeson has the perfect persona for B&W and delivers a Oscar caliber performance, along with Kingsley and Fiennes. And lastly, and certainly not least, the production value here is amazing. They really brought this time alive with hundreds if not thousands of extras and sets. It is a tragedy that the Holocaust ever happened, but it is a godsend that Spielberg made this film. It is one everyone should see.",NA
"lhhung_himself","11 February 2002","Schindler's list is not a bad film per se - Liam Neeson is very good as Schindler and if you edit out some of the more overblown scenes - the story is still riveting. Yet it could have been so much more if the story just told simply and if the central theme were fully understood and developed.Before the war Schindler and his friend, Goeth were boozy, flirtatious German businessmen. Both would have likely been uninspired failures had there been no war. In a kinder world, Goeth's and Schindler's moral differences might have manifested themselves in the size of the tip that they would leave the barmaid. In war, the consequences of moral choices are greatly magnified, resulting in Schindler becoming a most unlikely heroic figure, and Goeth becoming a loathed prison commandant. In the film, Spielberg elevates Schindler to sainthood status and portrays Goeth as a sadistic psychopath. By sanitizing Schindler's many faults (boozing, gambling, womanizing...) and by demonizing Goeth, Spielberg severs our connection with them and, ironically, blunts the conflict between them. Adolf Eichmann was far more chilling than Charles Manson. Unlike Manson, whom we could dismiss as psychotic, Eichmann was the faceless functionary that we have all experienced, whose defense of ""following orders"" is one that we have all heard, a defense that was used by many during the war, and one that we might see ourselves using under similar circumstances had we not Schindler's courage. By making Schindler a saint, Spielberg diminishes both his accomplishment and his inspiration to us - saints have no problems making the right decision - the rest of us do. Rather than a gaping chasm, there is but a fine moral line between Schindler and Goeth - one that we tread every day, which fortunately for us, rarely does more than determines a barmaid's salary.Spielberg does not develop this simple theme, preferring to impress us with a grandiose view of a great moral tale. Instead, he comes off as the underskilled sous-chef drowning a wonderful filet mignon in an overly rich sauce. The quality of the ingredients still shine through despite the clumsy handling but does not approach its great potential. In the end, the best thing about the film is that it reminds Americans of a monstrous event in history. It is unfortunate that this reminder is necessary and that it reduces such a timeless parable to a useful public service announcement.",NA
"Chris J.","16 November 1998","Spielberg's masterpiece.  Even the framing device which some did not like worked well for me. The girl in the red dress may have been an obvious film device but it worked extremely well.

Neeson and Fiennes have been lauded many times and so should Kingsley.",NA
"Starks","22 April 1999","After every time I watch Schindler's List, I always ask myself how did Ralph Fiennes not win a best supporting actor Oscar for his work in this movie? His performance in this movie was superb.Everything about this film is right on the money (okay, okay, Liam Neeson's thing at the end, ""...this pin could have saved 3 people... this limousine 10 people..."" was a little over the top [maybe]). The first time I saw Schindler's was in 1993 in Manhattan, I was moved to tears. Afterwards a woman (who I had never met before) sitting next to me who looked to be in her 60s reached over the armrest, embraced me and then kissed me on the cheek. She then said, ""thank you,"" and left. Was she or a member of her family a holocaust survivor?  I'll never know but it was great to see a movie have such an effect on its audience. I highly recommend this movie and also to those who have seen it already I recommend a visit to the national Holocaust museum in Washington DC. If you thought Schindler's List was amazing, a trip to the museum really emphasizes the scale and magnitude of this act of evil.",NA

"blackburnj-1","28 October 2005","Steven Spielberg's career was somewhat unfilled before 1993. Sure there were some fine films and some enjoyable films but there wasn't the truly great film that such a great filmmaker deserved. In 1993, that drought was ended by Schindler's List.When Poland is subdued by the invading Nazi armies, Oskar Schindler attempts to form a business, employing only Jews and freeing them from the Ghetto. However, the Holocaust and the Final Solution begin to take hold; more and more of his workers are taken to concentration camps but Schindler continues to try and get Jews into his factories. However, as the year begins to draw to a close, Schindler begins to draw up a list of Jews who he wants to buy and take to his own factory.What a film! It is fantastic. It is supremely well made, exquisitely written with a touching score and brilliantly shot. It is a tour-de-force with three fantastic central performances from Liam Neeson as the benevolent and great Schindler, Ben Kingsley as the mistreated Jew, Itzhak Stern and Ralph Fiennes as the homicidal and psychotic Goeth. It is simply sublime from all.John Williams' score is possibly his best ever (which is high praise indeed). The photography is superb from Janusz Kaminski and they all help to make a film that has two strong bases. The first is Steven Zaillian's fantastic script, brilliant created and moulded. The second is Spielberg's direction, which is genial, brilliant and sublime. He deals with the case of the Holocaust in a suitably stark way but he also provides an uplifting film that shows humanity's better side in one man at the very least. He also uses his skill to the maximum. In particular, his use of colour is awesome, especially his focusing on a girl in a red coat during the liquidation of the ghetto and her re-appearance later in the film Put simply, this is a film that is veritably great.Without a doubt, the film is one of the greatest ever and should be seen by all.",NA
"ShibanPD","12 November 2012","Steven Spielberg's meticulous, passionate direction; John Williams' haunting, uplifting score, highlighted by violin solos by Itzhak Perlman; Janusz Kaminski's stunning black-and-white photography; Steven Zaillian's award-winning screenplay; and the acting brilliance of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes coalesce to render, ironically, one of the most beautiful films ever made, based on actual events that took place during one of the ugliest chapters in modern history. Neeson's screen presence as Oskar Schindler, the unlikely savior of hundreds of Polish Jews during the Holocaust, is commanding and magnetic. Kingsley's performance as Schindler's accountant and eventual friend is neurotic and tender. Fiennes plays Amon Goeth, a cold, sadistic Nazi officer, with startling range and subtlety. Williams' score and Spielberg's camera are characters in their own right, narrating and observing with unnerving honesty and pathos. From the perspective of the captive Jews and their plight, Schindler's List is frightening beyond imagination, thrilling, and unbearably sad. From Schindler's perspective, the initial prospect of profiting from a slave-wage workforce and an economic climate that only war could engender is opportunistically exciting. But when the plan changes from profit to protection, the excitement takes on a different form, as Schindler faces the danger of the Nazis discovering his altruistic motives at every turn. From the perspective of the Nazis, the unconstrained license to kill, at justifiably remorseless will, is liberating. Murder is easy, especially when the victims have been dehumanized in a much more savage way than any real wartime enemy. In one scene, a Nazi is firing rounds into a burning hill of murdered Jews, and he is screaming jubilantly and laughing. In another, Amon Goeth picks off random workers from his bird's eye ""villa"" as if he is shooting at clay pigeons. It's target practice; it's a free game, a joke. That feeling of irresponsible liberation is eventually supplanted by true liberation as the clandestinely moral acts of Oskar Schindler overtake the immorality of the Nazis and as Schindler assumes the weighty responsibility for more and more human lives. Schindler's List is not a movie about the Holocaust, any more than it is a movie about World War II. It is about a man—a magnanimous profiteer—living in a time and place of unspeakable acts. It's about a forbidden friendship that flourishes amidst the failure of humanity and the prevalence of hatred. And it's about the hope for—not the triumph of—Good over Evil.",NA
"intelearts","26 March 2012","Schindler's List is almost too painful to watch - a remarkably subdued but traumatically powerful account of the greatest evil ever perpetrated by mankind. I can't watch it without weeping, not just crying, but every time, I just weep. Spielberg sets aside all sense of melodrama and instead gives us not only remarkable characterization in Oskar Schindler, Amon Goeth, and Itzak Stern, but also brings an enormous sense of humanity and dignity to an almost impossible subject. I cannot begin to say what it was like to see this for the first time in the cinema the week it was released - it was simply the greatest film I had seen - it truly captures something about human dignity and hope as well as evil and complacency that go beyond words.I could write about the magnificent production, and filming, grading, editing and care - but above and beyond this there is just the power of the true story - that one man did make a difference is almost impossible to comprehend given the odds and given the circumstances.Cinema at its very very best can capture both the reality and the hyper-reality in a way that no other art form can - Schindler's List does - and it remains a living testament and the most powerful reminder that we all can and must choose good over evil. Schindler's List remains for me one of the greatest, if not the greatest, film I have seen and I always knew it would be my 500th review. Thank you Steven Spielberg, and I hope it will serve always as a reminder why courage and good really matter.",NA
"DerBarenJude","12 May 2004","Possible spoilers:I just finished this movie.  I was touched not by the graphic displays of violence and murder, but by the humanity displayed in the face of monstrosities too horrible to even consider.  Possibly the most moving film I have ever seen.  I'm sure that the film takes liberties, but the truly frightening thing is that I am sure that they are few and far between.  The scene in the showers may have been the most horrific moment I have ever witnessed in cinema.  The violence is so hideous and dehumanizing that it puts the displays of kindness in a unique perspective.  The scene on the trains, where Schindler provides water is one example.  I knew precisely what to expect from this movie.  What I did not expect was the portrait of kindness and humanity that it provides.  Everyone in the world should watch this movie at least once.",NA
"axismladen","19 June 2010","All the people say about it is true! Schindler's List is simply remarkable! No other movie has never shown the horrific thing's that the people in death camps, including not only Jew's but everyone, were witnesses and part of every single day! Very well done! And i give a big credit for it to a producer, BRANKO LUSTIG, who was an AUSCHWITZ surviver when he was a little kid. I'm sure, as Spielberg sais, that he had a big influence on this movie.------------------------- The directing is amazingly beautiful and this is one of the best directed movies ever. I like how it was shot in black and white. It gave a lot of dept to certain scenes and the whole movie. I especially liked the certain part's such as the one when we see a little girl in red coat in the distance and everything except her coat is in black and white. That was a beautiful scene. It really seals in your memory! As does the other part when we see the little girl in the red coat. I also liked the part at which a couple of Jews are praying around the candle and everything except for the fire of the candle is in black and white! Such a great scene! You can really sympathize with them! -------------------------- Writing is just great! The best part about it is characterization! I like the way Schindler was shown. How he was nothing but an idiot in the beginning and didn't care about anything or anyone except for his own pocket which he later on completely emptied in order to save the lives of his workers which were brutally killed every single day. I especially loved the character of AMON GOETH! What a great portrayal of a sick and evil man that's even kinda charming at times. I really loved his character. Simply perfect! It belong's to the movie history. As does the entire movie! And Ralph Fiennes was excellent! Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley were also great. Though, Ralph steals the show here!!! ---------------------------Another thing i must mention is music! John Williams composed something beautiful! I'm usually a big fan of Rock'n'Roll but i just can't stop listening to this song or a score, whatever it is! It's really beautiful and i'm sure it will be remembered and listened in two hundred year's from now because it's just outstanding!!! The violin sound's like it's crying! Beautiful!!!! ---------------------------- A perfect movie that deserves to be remembered and that, i'm sure, will be remembered just as the event's it show's and all the people that been through 'em! WATCH IT UNDER ANY COST!!!! SIMPLY GREAT!!!!",NA

Of course I've read about the holocaust and I saw WW 2 movies about it, but nothing could prepare me for this masterpiece. It's so gripping and emotional.All the actors are at their best. They do not act, they are the characters. Ralph Fiennes is most terrifying as Amon Goeth.The photography is as beatiful as documentary- like. After three hours, when the end credits start to roll, I realized I was watching a movie and not a documentary. And of course, Spielbergs direction makes it all just a perfect history lesson.It's a must see for everybody!",NA

"rickdumesnil","5 April 2008","it took 50 years until another movie could touch my heart strings as much as so proudly we hail1943 did.SCHINDLER S list absolutely grabbed me in every way.The movie made me realize that that could have been my mom or my dad....caught in these death camps....they were alive then and living peacefully in Canada. What a masterpiece...the black and white cinematography....the little red coat....etc.My favorite 2 scenes of many are....when Schindler sees the little red coat on the pile of dead Jews.....and the scene where the survivors offer him a ring with the gold of their teeth. touching...i shall never forget this film....only one captured me after that.....broke back mountain 2005. Lian was genial...and of course my heath ledger too....both great moments of acting in American cinema",NA
"necrocris2000","21 June 2017","In my opinion one of the best drama movies that i ever saw. This movie shows how people are, 99% evil, bad, cruel, and the others 1% kind, peaceful, helpful. One man can save thousands, only because ""he's a good guy"" ! This movie also shows how were the Germans when they occupied Poland",NA
"Angry_Arguer","4 October 2002","The European Holocaust unleashed by Adolph Hitler and his deranged madmen will always be one of history's darkest moments.  To present this on film is one of the most difficult things to do, how do you present all the tragedy, horror, grotesque, and evil of the events from 1939-1945 outside of Western eyes for six long years with the sense of hope that still remained in many minds...many didn't live to see that hope come true in the form of liberating capitalists and communists.Spielberg has gone from creating fun films like Indiana Jones to drama of the first order.  Many scenes oft mentioned by critics still can resonate in our minds with both visual beauty and unflinching brutality.  The Krakow ghetto liquidation, Schindler making his various deals, the near executions and the ones that fall through, the burning of the bodies at the camps. All of this is done in a fashion unlike Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg's other big WWII movie.  Neeson is perfect as the man who is both human (immoral, corrupt, and sinful like all of us) and savior (do-gooder, compassionate).Six million Jews were burned, gassed, shot, or died of starvation in the Holocaust, such equivalence would be nuking New York.  For such horrible loss, the Jews gained a nation to call their own.  THAT is why for 70 years they have continuously fought the Arabs and never lost, to prevent another Holocaust that the UN could never stop from occuring.By far the most psychologically unique character of Schindler's List is Amon Goethe (most excellently portrayed by Ralpy Fiennes) as the cruel, SS commandant.  When he is first introduced in the Krakow winter, he is being shown the ghetto.  After his guide is almost finished, what does Amon say? Not sum racist comment or other Nazi-related speech on Aryan superiority, rather: ""Why is the roof down?  I'm f***king freezing!"" He doesn't care about people, later he takes potshots at his own prisoners and uses a method of extracting information from suspected thieves that would have Primetime drooling.  In a moment of possible humanity by being remotely polite to Helen, his Jewish ""maid"" brought in from the camps. Possibly resisting the urge to rape her, he beats her instead when his self-control runs out.  We are not sorry to see him die at the end.If the end or some point near the end does not cause you to reflect on your life or even just cry, you have missed the whole point of the movie that we can never again let anything like the holocaust happen--understood in places like Rwanda it is too late for that but our thoughts must be of tolerance and not blatant hate.",NA
"bill-422","4 August 1999","""Schindler's List"" is easily one of the greatest films ever made.  The technical wizardry and stark reality of this picture alone blow the great classics (Graduate, Casablanca, On The Waterfront) out of the water. Undeniably affecting historical drama has never been more fully realized and displayed in its nakedness like it is here.  Steven Spielberg richly deserves life-long accolades for creating this film.  His choice of b&w cinematography is brilliant.  Every tear, gunshot, death, laugh and cry are all fully realized.  Spielberg's epic is a far cry from normal Hollywood movie making and that unto itself is an amazing accomplishment for the misguided 90s filmmakers.Easily, the greatest creative element for this film is Ralph Fiennes. Without his central protagonistic presence, ""Schindler's List"" would certainly be a flawed examination of the Holocaust.  Instead, Fiennes' character displays uncontrollable impulsive fits of rage and unpredictability which epitomizes the Nazi aura.  Fiennes' performance is the best in recent years, and his finely drawn and provocative character richly deserves to be recognized as one of the greatest ever drawn up!True to life affecting drama has never been better and it seems incomprehensible to expect a motion picture of this magnitude and quality to appear again in our lifetimes.",NA
"fwgrhouse","30 April 2006","I saw this movie on DVD afew months ago and when I saw it it just grabbed me by the heart. I gave it a 10 because for one reason, it grabs people's attention and makes you think about the Holocaust and what the Jew's and other people went through during that horrible time. Another reason is because it shows what a great sacrifice a man made to save a bunch of people that he didn't know. It also takes you inside the Holocust and the terrible things those people went through like having to strip naked in front of people, then have their heads shaved, and be forced to do hard labor with little or no food until they were too weak to work and were sent to the gas chambers. I would recommend this film for anyone over the age of 13 because of all the realistic violence, language, strong nudity and sexual activity. But I can guarantee you that once you have seen this film, you will think differently about the Holocust.",NA
"ElijahCSkuggs","13 November 2007","SCHINDLER'S LIST, based on the book by Thomas Keneally, is the closest thing to a perfect picture that I've ever seen. There are others that would qualify, but none have given me the emotional wallop that this did back in '93.The acting is perfect, mesmerizing in some cases, especially by Ralph Fiennes; the score is beautiful and unforgettable; the direction is masterful, and the use of crisp black and white color underlies the film's realism and dark history.The legacy of Oskar Schindler was new to me when I first saw this, and thanks to Spielberg, the story of one man's change of heart will be remembered forever. SCHINDLER'S LIST, to this day, is a prime example of inspired and mesmerizing cinema.",NA
"jacobjohntaylor1","30 May 2017","This is an awful movie. It has an awful story. It is very slow and boring. It is not fun to watch at all. I do not know why it got an 8.9. Just because people like sad boring movie. I do not like sad boring movie. If I want to be sad and bored I will just live my life. I do not need a movie to remind me how sad and boring life is. This is 4. It is not a 8.9 that is just hype. Do not wast your time. Do not wast your money. Do not see this movie. It a long movie and life is to short. If was a long movie and it was something good to see like Lord of the rings then it would worth the time. This is not. Good actors wasted there time being in this awful movie.",NA
"StoryCharts","15 August 2013","Schindler's List is about the idea that good triumphs over evil. Small gestures of kindness can overcome the inconvenient irks of everyday life, but absolute good must rise to the occasion to meet absolute evil, no matter the cost. In this story, there is no question about the absolute evil: the innocent victims of the Holocaust (the appeasement of which implicates us all, see The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich). In the backdrop of this absolute evil, our hero is not without guilt. He is a Nazi party member, an unabashed adulterer and war profiteer. But when history gives him the chance, he chooses to pursue an absolute good, the saving of a thousand innocent Jews from certain death. And this absolute good, pursued to the cost of his entire fortune, redeems him of all the other ills he had accumulated over his life.To give this idea life, the story's main plot is that of Schindler saving the Jews. To show the cost of this success, another plot tracks his fortune which is given up to save the Jews. Two other internal plots depict the morality of Schindler and Goeth. To make us experience the idea, absolute evil is given a face, a personality and a humane charm. The choices Goeth and Schindler make highlight the inner battles that must be won to strive for the absolute good.This story is so powerful, it's meaning so relevant, that its experience is almost beyond words. This is why movies should be made. Its special resonance comes from the fact that given the ideas of such absolutes, the hero and villain are not depicted as black and white. The same story could easily have veered to a didactic history lesson, instead it is a shared experience that makes the world a better place by reminding us of what the human species is capable of doing to itself.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",NA
"gottogorunning","13 August 2005","In 1942, a German Nazi named Oskar Schindler developed a business, in Krakow, Germany. It was managed by a Jewish man, Itzchak Stern, and populated hundreds of working Jews. One day, the workers and the living Jews in the ghetto were overruled by invading Nazis, led by Amon Goeth. They were evacuated and taken to a concentration camp near the ghetto. Devastated by the loss of workers, Schindler demanded to Goeth that his workers be released immediately. But not so; Goeth told Schindler that the Jews were to remain in the camp. Determined, and self-willed, Schindler opened a business near the camp, and made a list of Jews that could work there. The list was only meant for a couple hundreds, but eventually became a list with one thousand and eleven Jew names on it. The Jews were shipped out, and worked until the end of the war. Afterwards, at midnight the day World War II was strictly declared over, Stern and some friends made a letter of evidence that Schindler was innocent, and a ring out of a Jew's tooth, with the words ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"" inscribed on the side. It was at exact moment that Schindler learned that not only did his factory become successful, it saved the lives of Jewish victims.This is a beautiful yet horrifying crafted movie about the terrible Holocaust. It is a very well-done picture, with fantastic cinematography-all done in black and white-, flawless acting, and a powerful score. Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, showing the kindness yet fierceness of the man who was considered a 'savior.' Ben Kingsley is wonderful as the Jewish assistant, Itzchak Stern. But the most recognizable performance of the cast is Ralph Fiennes, who is incredible as the root of all evil, Amon Goeth.The story is incredible all in itself, and it contains such mind-blowing images, text, and sounds. Spielberg used his directing skills very well, showing audiences the real horrors and incredible sadness through these elements. Such complex things are heart-wrenching to imagine, but not even this film can display the Holocaust. This film shows only but a pinprick of the evils of this senseless massacre.Notable scenes are the liquidation of the Ghetto, the children escape, and, most of all, the heartbreaking close-to-the-end scene. The final scene is emotional, because you see the 'Schindler Jews', along with the actors that played them, place rocks on the grave of Schindler. And the last person, whom is only but a shadow to us, places a red rose in the middle.I cannot tell you the incredible and durable sadness I felt as I watched this film, but it made me realize that even ordinary people can save lives. I recommend that everyone should see this; it really is more than a regular film. It is a masterpiece.",NA
