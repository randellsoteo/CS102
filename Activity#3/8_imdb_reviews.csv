"kylopod","17 November 2005","One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.","

"SebMoz","12 November 2020","This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time.","

"gogoschka-1","24 July 2014","I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's – well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","

"gautammayya","10 April 2020","Possibly the most influential movie made in history since the first movie ever made .Even after 25 years and a countless number of copy cats this movie absolutely holds up and feels fresh.As many of you would know this movie is sort of like a tribute to the pulp stories written back in the 40s and 50s which have punchy and witty dialogue and over the top violence. The random chit chat between characters regarding obscure things might feel a waste of time as it doesn't move the plot. But Tarantino is a genius and he believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable(The absolute converse of Nolan). This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish.. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone. To top it off all the actors arguably give their career best performance(think about it ,it is true) . And the ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere(like the psycho tribute scene with marsellus and butch which is so unexpected or that adrenaline shot scene) is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats .So if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for . It is funny, filled with some of the best dialogues ever ,superbly acted, great soundtracks(I just wanna see Tarantino's ipod , boy does he have great taste) and is just a spectacular experience.Spoilers ahead(duh):
For those of you who say the characters are hollow I suggest you to revisit the gold watch sequence. Walken's Capt Koons tells a story to young butch about how Butch's grandpa requested an enemy soldier to return his watch to his family and the soldier agreed. Similarly Butch could have left Marsellus but the legacy of his watch made him save him which I believe was a nice touch. And how Jules(one of my characters of all time) undergoes a change is also a noteworthy counter argument to the above mentioned criticism.Sorry for the huge review..","

"Jeremy_Urquhart","20 April 2020","Perhaps before I start talking about why I think Pulp Fiction works on so many levels, I should mention briefly how I came to watch the film. Pulp Fiction was a film I had heard of at a very young age, and I'm not quite sure why. I had also wanted to see it for a very long time- again, I'm not quite sure why. Maybe the mere fact that it was R-rated and notorious for its violence perked the interest of my 14-year-old self. Nevertheless, I got round to watching it about a month before my 15th birthday- incredibly late at night on an occasion where I found myself home alone. I recall being blown away by the film, but also somewhat overwhelmed and confused. I had never seen anything like it before, and walked away from it being kinda sure I'd enjoyed it. I couldn't say for sure though.Still feeling curious about the film, and the many mysteries relating to it that I'd failed to determine on my first viewing, I re-watched the film just a couple of months later. And something just clicked for me- I fell in love with the film. Everything about the movie suddenly worked for me, and I found the second viewing to be perhaps the shortest two and a half hours of my life I've ever experienced. My own sense of time was warped and bended to the extent that it was in the film itself. That very night it somehow became one of the greatest things I had ever watched; one of the only films I'd seen that I barely hesitated to call a masterpiece.Since then I've watched it another six or seven times- almost once a year- and I continue to feel motivated to watch it because I honestly feel like I get something new out of it each time I watch it.Spoilers ahead, by the way. I plan to get fairly in-depth with my review of this movie, so just a warning for those that haven't seen it.One of the great things about Pulp Fiction is its refusal to fall under any particular genre or category of movies. It feels like a comedy when Jules and Vince discuss fast food and foot massages for nearly ten minutes It feels like a thriller during several segments, notably the scene where Mia overdoses on heroin and the climactic Mexican stand-off in the restaurant- two sequences that would have even Alfred Hitchcock on the edge of his seat. The crime genre is represented through the character's actions- most of the cast are criminals in one way or another, whether they murder, steal, or take generous helpings of class-A drugs. The infamous gimp scene feels straight out of a horror movie.This collage of various movie genres is one of the things that makes the movie stand out- by themselves, certain scenes may feel familiar, but when they're all blended together so well like they are in Pulp Fiction, the end product ends up feeling unique. This is true for most of Quentin Tarantino's films- he borrows elements from different genres, and homages/ references dozens of older movies in order to create something that feels unique, even if most of the individual elements themselves aren't too original. I can see why some people may not be a fan of the fact Tarantino essentially steals from the lesser known works of those who came before him, but for me, I love it- I think he just makes it work due to the fact that his encyclopaedic knowledge of film allows him to borrow from so many sources. If he simply referenced about a half dozen or less films for each one of his movies, then I think that would start to feel like plagiarism.Now, I could go on about the acting, the screenplay, the direction, and the glorious soundtrack, but really, what's there to say about these elements of the film that haven't already been said? Tarantino's screenplay is one of the most acclaimed and quoted from the past couple of decades, and deservedly won him his first Oscar. His direction has been similarly praised, and the soundtrack has become iconic- most impressive of all is that Tarantino chose music that goes so well with the images they accompany. And yes, the acting is phenomenal- the film features what is almost certainly Samuel L. Jackson's best performance, one of Bruce Willis' most interesting performances of his long and successful career, and some great work from Uma Thurman. Even the supporting actors are memorable, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace (who's arguably the film's main character- think about it; without him, none of the three main stories would exist- Butch ripped off Marsellus Wallace, Vince took out Wallace's girlfriend on a date that eventually went horribly wrong, and Vince and Jules were assigned to retrieve the mysterious briefcase for Wallace). And of course, who can forget that Pulp Fiction single-handedly made John Travolta cool again- an absolutely monumental achievement. Of course Travolta did eventually succeed in making himself a joke again a few years later when he made Battlefield Earth, but that's another story (or perhaps better left for another review)?As I said, I could indulge in commenting on these areas of the film, but if you've seen the movie you probably already know how good they are. Pulp Fiction is also one of the most discussed film's of the past 20 years, so you've likely already come across reviews or rabid Tarantino fans who've gushed about why the film works so well, and how fantastic all the various components of the film are.So instead, I'm going to backtrack back to my point about seeing something new in the film upon every new viewing, and explain what I took away from the movie on my most recent viewing.Pulp Fiction was always controversial for its violence, with some criticising its depiction of assaults, shootings, beatings, and exploding heads. But for me, I found the film to have an almost anti-violence message of sorts, and I only realised this on my most recent viewing. Now bear with me, because I know that sounds like a somewhat ridiculous claim, but I have my reasons. Pulp Fiction may be violent, but it doesn't promote violence. Sure, the violence may be somewhat stylised and at times over the top, but that doesn't mean the film is saying that violence is something trivial. Violent acts in the film are often shown to have consequences for those that commit them. Vince's carelessness with his gun- an instrument of violence- causes Marvin's head to be blown off in the backseat of Jules' car, which leads to a near twenty minute detour in which they must take the car to Jimmy's house and consult ""The Wolf"" to assist them in cleaning the car and disposing of the gory evidence. Marsellus' desire to get revenge on Butch by presumably killing him leads them both to the basement of the rednecks- indeed, they are both fighting each other in the redneck's store when they are taken captive.But in the climax of the film, where guns are being pointed at several characters in the middle of a tense Mexican stand-off, not a single bullet is fired. One would expect the tension to be eventually broken and the bullets to start flying, especially if one has seen some of Taratino's other movies that end in explosive and violent climaxes (see Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Death Proof, Django Unchained, and Kill Bill Volume 1). But instead, Jules, who we've seen to be ruthless and unafraid to kill earlier in the movie, believes himself to be a changed man after miraculously surviving a hail-storm of bullets from a criminal that looks a little like Jerry Seinfeld and so instead decides to defuse the situation peacefully. He talks down Pumpkin and Honey-Bunny from killing or robbing anyone, and insists that his dim-witted associate Vince refrain from hurting anyone too. He delivers an absolutely stunning monologue where he ponders the bible reading he quoted so confidently earlier in the movie, and it's damn-near poetic. It sends a shiver up my spine every time I watch that scene, and indeed, Jules' speech works. The two robbers get up after Jules gives them some money from his famous wallet, and then leave. Jules and Vince do the same a few moments later.Not a shot is fired. No one is killed. It's an absolutely beautiful scene.It may have been tempting for Tarantino to give the film a ""Wild Bunch-esque"" ending, but instead he refrained, and I'm glad he did so. The climax to Pulp Fiction is absolutely stunning- fifteen minutes of tension, almost poetic dialogue, and brilliant acting, especially from Samuel L. Jackson. And it took me seven viewings just to notice how beautifully peaceful the ending of the film was. And that's why it's my favourite film of all time- I get new meaning from it, or appreciate different areas of it every-time I watch it.If you've never seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it.
And if you have seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it again.","

"Hitchcoc","7 December 2009","It took fifteen years and a subscription to Netflix to finally get around to seeing this film. It was well worth the wait. If all one were to see is the byplay between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, it would be worth the price of admission. But this is only part of the incredible effect this film has. I don't even like gore in movies; I avoid it. But Tarentino weaves a culture of violence where there is actual humanity. We care about these bad guys. There is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. The very idea that the boxer, played by Bruce Willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. And very, very funny. I can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. The opening dialogue is incredible as Trovolta and Jackson are on their way to do a hit. They have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. The date scene with Uma Thurman with the adrenaline shot. The crazy's in the pawn shop. And, the effort to clean up the car after blowing away a kid in the back seat, the issue being that a guys wife would come home and be very unhappy to find a dead body and a blood filled car in the garage. It sounds horrible and makes me sound sick. I found Fargo to be a hilarious film as well. Is there something wrong with me?","

"tfrizzell","25 June 2000","My oh my.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5.","

"jaaanmerz","6 November 2020","Pulp Fiction is the most original, rule breaking film I have ever seen. Instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, Pulp Fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share. Anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasn't analysed enough. I highly recommend this film since it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time.","

"Quinoa1984","20 January 2000","Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you.","

"hitchcockthelegend","13 February 2012","It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why?Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clichés, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. I myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks.Yet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of Pulp Fiction's greatness arises. That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, Tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. Neat trick that from Tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10","

Jackson and Uma Thurman.The movie is a good crime thriller that all movie lovers should watch. And in some ways the movie does live up to it's hype because the story is well written and acted out good too.But, to me, the movie is overrated. It seems that *some* of the people that loves this movie will act/talk like it's the only movie worth watching - like it is the ""King of Films"".

"TheHoodOfSwords","21 April 2020","Conflicted on this one. I like a lot of elements of it, the characters are (mostly) really compelling and interesting. I think some of the ""Segments"" are a lot stronger than others. I think that the first part of Bruce Willis's story is just... bland. I didn't find it very interesting or compelling. It gets interesting though. The first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it's pretty strong. I do think this film is slightly overrated. That's not to say that it isn't good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10.","

"avik-basu1889","2 May 2017","This is a tour de force of brilliantly precise screen writing, perfect acting, precise camera-work, perfect directing and world class dialogue writing. 'Pulp Fiction' is Tarantino's carnival of funny, but equally abrasive nihilism. This is a film which has a surprisingly firm backbone of morality beneath the crazy and deranged surface. Tarantino is constantly on the lookout for characters who make a choice to turn their back on their meaningless lives of nihilistic violence and look for honour and a purpose. The characters who make that choice are allowed to ride off into the sunset, while the characters who decide to not change and stick to their meaningless cyclical lives of never-ending crime and violence are burdened with unenviable fates. There is a method to the madness. Tarantino makes the film and the characters infinitely rich. However while doing all this, he never stops having fun. There are endless film references, pop culture references and other stuff that signifies the film's self- consciousness which constantly make the viewer feel the fact that they are watching a film, a piece of fiction through Tarantino's eyes and not anything attached to reality.Some people tend to trivialise the structure of the screenplay by calling it a gimmick. But as far as I'm concerned the structure of the screenplay is essential and indispensable in the context of the narrative and in the context of how Tarantino wants to drive home the themes that he is exploring. In a nutshell........ yeah, 'Pulp Fiction' is a masterpiece, it's a bad mother#*%@er.","

"planktonrules","13 March 2010","""Pulp Fiction"" is a brilliantly crafted film. The many separate vignettes all are quite compelling and fit together wonderfully. And, on top of that, the script and acting are exceptional. And, most importantly, the film is wildly original and very, very stylish. The only reservations I have are minor. First, while this is a very, very good film, I can't see why it is ranked #5 all-time on IMDb. This seems wildly overrated and too often more recent films seem to dominated IMDb's Top 250. Second, this film is certainly NOT for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any Tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive.Because there are so many reviews for the film already, I won't bother to try to give a synopsis of the film or do an in-depth analysis.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","26 December 2022","Pulp Fiction is to be seen to be believed, it was big, it was brash, it certainly arrived with a bang.One of the most stylish films ever made, Quentin Tarantino delivered something that viewers had been starved of for so many years, Pulp Fiction offered wondering very keen, like a new voice.Le Big Mac, that scene where Jules and Vincent are rambling on about McDonalds, just before doing a hit, that's one of.my favourite moments, the iconic moment though, Vincent and Mia dancing, it has to be one of the greatest movie scenes of all time, Chuck Berry, a scene I repeat and repeat, it's sublime.I'm not even sure if I like the storyline or not, it's maybe a little trashy, it just doesn't matter somehow, the film's good points are turbocharged enough to hide over any cracks. It's wonderfully violent, incredibly well paced, and full of action.Astonishing cast, Travolta at his best, Jackson, Thurman, Keitel, Roth, Willis, the names are endless, brilliant.The music, the music is just astonishing, it's what ears were designed for, you'll watch this and you'll be reaching for the soundtrack.What cinema was made for 10/10.","

"Bamboo1","9 October 2020","Pulp Fiction is pretty much Once upon a time in Hollywood, but better in every regard.Pulp Fiction encapsulated and defined the 90s, that's what this movie was. A piece of art, not a movie.This movie is all about the characters and the actors, not any plot. That's why I would rate the movie as follows1. Characters 112. Acting 103. Plot 74. Cinematography 105. World building 10We have stellar characters and acting. Cinematography is also amazing, it really sucks you in and the world building really makes you fell like you are in the 90s.","

"discoelephant64","19 January 2005","Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it.","

"Real_Review","31 December 2019","This is the most reviewed movie for which I have ever attempted to craft an original review - almost 2,800 posted reviews here on IMDB, so far. I'm sure everything has been said already, so I'll keep this review short.'The Twist' scene with Travolta and Thurman was courageous film-making from a young director, and it took even more courage to include it in the final version of the film. At the end of the day, if we don't all agree that 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) was genius, then Tarantino looks arrogant and we all point to that scene as an example of a has-been actor and an over-rated young director. Instead, I watch that scene and hold my breath, because even without dialogue, Tarantino used two cameras to make magic on the screen for those few minutes. That scene is a microcosm of the entire film - bold & brilliant.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

"terryzhangtianrun","22 July 2020","The film written by Quentin is truly an astonishing masterpiece. This story is divided into four parts which is hard to conclude it with several sentences. Mr. Tarantino did an perfect job on characterization. Every person was vividly portrayed. For example, at the begining of the film, Marsellus Wallace didn't show up, but we could know from the conversation between Jules and Vincent that he is such a powerful gangster and nobody who knows him dare to mess with him. And Vincent was also shaped in different angles and details. In the movie, he is a man of humer, a good partner, and the spot in this movie which is dramatic when he killed by Butch. The movie was full of black humer and it might wants to say, nobody would be the 'righteous man' in the world of violence, but their character is vividly brought to your attention by Quentin, which makes up this high-scoring movie","

"TheLittleSongbird","9 December 2010","What can I say? This film is amazing, and I would go further and say it is my favourite Quentin Tarantino film, and one of my favourites of the 90s. The cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a Tarantino film actually. The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable. Pulp Fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"Luke-20","30 December 1998","If you think ""Pulp Fiction"" is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that. It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But why? Because of the many ""f"" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is ""cool"", he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about ""Pulp Fiction""? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece.","

"brianberta","2 December 2015","Going into this for the first time, I knew this would be a good movie and I would enjoy it. However, I had no idea that it would be this good. It practically blew me away.This movie follows how 6 people's lives are all intertwined in an action packed tale of gun violence, drug-use, and murder.What this film is most famous for is its twisted timeline which is never too confusing but also very impressive. When I first saw the beginning, I didn't think much of it and as the film progressed, I forgot about it. But when it comes back at the ending, I knew I was in for a treat. The movie has several of these surprises which will knock you out cold and they are made brilliant by its twisting plot. I was in awe when the credits first started to roll.Also, this movie has an outstanding soundtrack which is actually pretty recognizable and iconic. It is also very well-done too. I honestly feel that it perfectly fits the movie. Like Jaws, when I think of this movie, the soundtrack which played during the end credits instantly plays in my head. It may not be as iconic as Jaws's music but it definitely is of equal quality.Also, the acting couldn't be much better. In my opinion, John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and Bruce Willis all gave perfect performances. They are all able to convey so many moods at once with their facial expressions and they couldn't do any better.This movie also has very great repeat watchability to it. The first viewing of this masterpiece is unforgettable. But just like Fight Club, this movie gets better and better every time you watch it. Mainly because the fact that you know what's going to happen and that you know all of its surprises, makes several scenes even more engaging. Also, this movie has so many iconic lines and scenes. It's super rare for a film to have 2 iconic scenes but this movie has several of them which have been retold and parodied so many times in pop culture.So in conclusion, this movie is in fact a masterpiece because of many reasons. It has changed cinema so much and it has shown the test of time for over 20 years. I think that this film is going to be remembered for many more decades also. I think that this is Tarantino's best film and I also think that it is one of the best movies ever made. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys action and complex plot structures to movies.","

"Gatorman9","18 April 2004","I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930's (even to my one fairly ""hip"" relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later film's sleaze and violence.In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990's, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, don't miss another 1990's Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.)","

"heisenberg12","9 February 2020","So original, it comes off like an experimentational movie, but one that catches fire with absolutely brilliant writing, dialogue, and character creation, in addition to all-time standout performances by every single actor, which means the directing was also superb.Some people may still question what it's about because for the most part we have four different stories converging at various coordinates in a timeline loop that do not clearly have a meaning as to why other than to just have creative fun with the way it's told.You have a philosophizing, bible thumping hitman (Samuel L Jackson) finding his path to salvation and restored faith and theism while participating in the events that comprise the movie. This movie is perfect in so many scenes with only a few weak parts. It's loaded with memorable lines, and it was meticulously cared for into every last detail including the music and what dance moves characters should have in addition to the outrageously brilliant screenplay that somehow never slips over the top.Tarantino still hasn't even come close to this lightning in a bottle masterpiece.","

"BandSAboutMovies","22 July 2019","There are movies and then there are forces of pop culture nature. Pulp Fiction is just such a film. While so much before influenced it, nothing after would ever be the same. In its wake, so many films tried to xerox its non-linear narrative, ultraviolence and wildly veering plot points. Pretty much not a single one of them is halfway decent by comparison.Tarantino took some scenes that Roger Avery intended for True Romance and decided that none of the film would appear in true order. For many, it was the first film they had ever watched that had monologues and conversations that were at the same time about everything and nothing all at once. While TriStar Pictures turned down the film, it became the first movie that Miramax would fully finance.Why would TriStar not want to make this film, particularly after Tarantino had become so big after Reservoir Dogs? Roger Avary said that the studio had issues with nearly every part of the movie, as they basically said, ""This is the worst thing ever written. It makes no sense. Someone's dead and then they're alive. It's too long, violent and unfilmable.""I wonder how the person that said that felt after Pulp Fiction was voted as the winner of the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for seven Oscars. Obviously, this film was also a commercial success, remaking the career of John Travolta and causing people to take notice of the acting skills of Uma Thurman and Samuel Jackson.There's a moment in this film that determines whether or not you like and understand Tarantino. Before they enter Jack Rabbit Slim's, Mia Wallace (Thurman) asks if Vincent Vega (Travolta) is square and she illustrates that point with her fingers. Suddenly, the movie becomes animated and dashed lines illustrate her point and realism fades away. In this small moment, you either think that this is the dumbest thing you've ever seen, totally pretentious or completely and utterly awesome. I fall into the latter category and began cheering the moment it happened on screen.Pulp Fiction begins with a diner being held up by Ringo (Tim Roth, who was in Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer, So I Married an Axe Murderer) before we move into Jules Winnfield (Jackson) and Vega (Travolta, in a role originally intended for Michael Madsen, who had played the other Vega brother, Mr. Blonde, in Reservoir Dogs) taking a briefcase back for their boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames, Con Air), after a long discussion of what McDonald's calls their food in Europe.What's in that briefcase? All that we learn is that the lock for it is 666, but it's a MacGuffin - a term invented by English screenwriter Angus MacPhail and popularized by Alfred Hitchcock. The case was originally going to have diamonds in it, but that's kind of boring. Instead, it opens to have a strange glow. Tarantino has been very coy about what it really is, even doing an interview with his friend Robert Rodriguez where they cut out the real answer before his fellow Grindhouse director says that the knowledge of what is really in the case radically changed how he saw the film.There are plenty of theories of what's really in that case. If we extrapolate that Tarantino was influenced by Kiss Me Deadly, then it's a nuclear device. It's been compared to the trunk in Repo Man. And an internet rumor began that it's really Marcellus Wallace's soul as evidenced by the band-aid on the back of his neck which is supposedly where the Egyptians believed the soul resided.The two bring the briefcase to their boss, Marsellus, but first, he bribes Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to do the job in his next match. Then, the boss goes out of town but asks Vega to show his wife a nice time. How nice of a time? After all, he threw a man out a window just for giving her a foot massage.About feet - this is the movie where Tarantino reveals his foot fetish. I'm not being rude or sly; it's 100% obvious upon watching the film.Before the date, Vega buys heroin from Lance (Eric Stoltz), who is out of balloons, so he puts it in a baggie. This will be important after the date of dinner and dancing at the aforementioned 1950's pop culture diner Jack Rabbit Slim's. Their dance scene here - taken almost move from move from Fellini's 8 1/2 scene where Barbara Steele dances with Mario Pisu - is more than just a simple physical scene. For a moment in time, it freezes reality and makes us think back to why we love Travolta the actor and not just Vincent the character that he is portraying. When we see him, we don't just see every role that he has ever played. We are fixated on the role that we first fell in love with, Tony Manero from Saturday Night Fever, bringing back fond thoughts of what it was like when to see the actor on the dance floor.Vega is obviously enamored of Mia and feels that things could feel the same with her, so he plans on simply leaving. However, she snorts the heroin - thinking it's coke - and nearly dies. It takes a needle of adrenaline right to her heart to fix things, as much as they can be fixed.While all this is going on, Butch wins the fight and kills his opponent. As he escapes in a taxi, its driver (Pittsburgh native Angela Jones, who graduated from the same college that I did, Point Park, and would go on to play the same character in the film Curdled, as well as date Slash) asks him what it's like to kill a man.Butch has told his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros, who was Anais Nin in Henry and June) to get everything ready to run away, but she forgot his gold watch, which we learn his father smuggled in a very uncomfortable place, along with Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), who tells him the story of the watch in a flashback. Butch must go back home, where he encounters Vega reading Modesty Blaise on the toilet. One barrage of bullets later and he's on the run, but when Marcellus Wallace crosses his path, he decides to hit him with his car.Both injured, Marcellus begins shooting at Butch, who runs into a pawnshop. Maynard (Duane Whitaker, one of the racist cops in Tales From the Hood), the owner, ends up taking both by gunpoint and ties them up in a room where his partner Zed (Peter Greene, who was in The Mask) takes Marcellus from behind while the gimp (Stephen Hibbert, who was married to Julia Sweeney at the time, who also shows up briefly as the daughter of Monster Joe; Joe was going to be played by Dick Miller, but that scene was cut) watches over Butch.Butch overpowers the man in the bondage suit and decided to go back and save his enemy, using a sword to kill Maynard while Marcellus grabs a shotgun and shoots Zed, wounding him just enough so that he can call some of his worst men to get revenge. They agree that Butch can leave, but can never come back to Los Angeles. He grabs Zed's bike, gets his girl - who really has caused so much of this mess because she acts like a child - and gets out of town.Why does Butch save the man who made his life hell? Because in Tarantino's mashup universe, protagonists live in the symbolic universe of the Japanese samurai, where honor is more important than anything. Leaving Marcellus to have his manhood further destroyed and then killed isn't the death that a warrior deserves. It's no accident that of the weapons offered, which also include a hammer, a chainsaw and a bat, he takes the sword.Back in time, as they get the briefcase, Jules and Vincent surviving an attack at Brett's apartment when a man somehow misses them every single time. They argue over whether this was a miracle or not, which leads to Vincent accidentally shooting Marvin (Phil LaMarr, the voice of Green Lantern John Stewart on the Justice League cartoons). They decide to visit Jules' friend Jimmie (Tarantino), who is stressed about his wife coming home from work. That means that the cleaner, Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel), must come and do his work by disposing of the evidence.That issue dealt with, the dup come back to the diner at the beginning of the film. Jules decides that he's going to retire and walk the earth like Kane from Kung Fu, which Vincent finds ridiculous. As he goes to the bathroom, the couple we met earlier start to rob the place. Vincent returns and this leads to a Mexican standoff, but Jules successfully uses his newfound love of peace to diffuse the situation and everyone leaves alive.The Bible passage that Jules quotes isn't exactly from the Good Book. It's more paraphrased and also harkens back to the lessons that Sonny Chiba would deliver before vanquishing evil in his films.Pulp Fiction got its start as a trilogy that would be written by Avery and Tarantino, but would also have a third director. It was inspired by Mario Bava's Black Sabbath, which is another portmanteau film. Tarantino's original story, Black Mask, ended up becoming Reservoir Dogs. Avery's story Pandemonium Reigns is the gold watch story within this film.There's no score to the film, but instead a pastiche of near underground American music. There's a ton of surf rock in this film, as Tarantino felt that it sounded like the themes of Italian spaghetti westerns.This is also the beginning of the incredibly self-referential universe of Tarantino films. Vincent Vega and Mr. Blonde being brothers, Red Apple cigarettes and Big Kahuna burgers show up in many of his films and Mia Wallace's TV pilot Fox Force Five is either a tease for Kill Bill or places that film as a fictionalized part of an overall narrative. For kids that grew up reading comic books or loving when TV shows crossed over, this would become an entirely new obsession. Throw in the fact that this movie references every movie that came before it and you get the reason why we're devoting an entire week to these films.Pulp Fiction is 25 years old this year. It doesn't feel that way. It achieves that rarest of movie dreams - utter timelessness.","

"maryolalov","25 January 2019","Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that not everyone can enjoy. Many people say that it's boring and senseless. It is true that the plot isn't something special but it isn't the plot that makes this movie so unique but the awesome script and great cinematography.Probably one of the greatest things in this movie are the dialogues. The dialogues just like in all other Tarantino movies aren't directly connected with the plot. Take the first dialogue between Samuel Jackson and John Travolta. They are talking about how a certain burger is called in France. This and many others dialogues don't have a direct relation with the plot line but their function is to somehow build the characters' personalities.The other thing that makes this movie so unique is the unexpected turn of events. Like in all other Tarantino movies you don't know who they are going to kill next or what is going to happen. The scene where Vincent shoots Marvin in the face is a great example for such unexpected turn of events. This makes the viewer more intrigued and thus makes the whole experience form the movie way better.There isn't much more that can be said about Pulp Fiction. It's not a movie that everyone will enjoy but still deserves to be seen.","

""Pump Fiction"" saved the career of John Travolta that was in the ostracism and put on the spot Quentin Tarantino after the cult ""Reservoir Dogs"". The complex screenplay with four entwined story has shown to the world the brilliance of Quentin Tarantino.

"zeekwunlau","19 April 2020","The narrative of the whole story is ups and downs. Hold the audience's attention very well. Each character has different meanings in different stories and seems to be shaped into different personalities. From beginning to end, the characters haven't changed, but we have seen more of the characters' stories. It can be said that Quentin's understanding of the script and the lens expression has reached a certain height.In fact, from the structure of the film, it is understood by individuals. Ah, echoing from beginning to end, very powerful. Elementary school students know that the composition is echoed from beginning to end, and play in a loop. So to take this bragging, I think it is insulting Quentin's level.When I watch this movie, I see Quentin's understanding of the characters. Gangs, boxing, drugs, underground culture. These things that seem far away from the lives of ordinary people have been put on the screen. The first caught the eye, but it looked vulgar. In fact, the characters have their own principles and abacus. No bad guy is stupid, and no policeman is just.So the whole movie has a lot of dialogue. Dialogue is an important code for explaining information, and it is also an important way for the audience to understand the characters. So Quentin worked hard on the conversation, the conversation in the restaurant, the conversation in the car, the conversation during the murder, etc. All dialogues are expressing the character's character, and not only the dialogue is used to express the speaker's character, but also the dialogue is used to shape the character of a character who has not yet appeared. All these conversations endow the characters with soul. It so happens that they are all interesting souls. In the real world, there are many people who are lonely, and there are few interesting souls. So, how attractive should these people on the screen be to us. And the weird advancement in the story doesn't seem reasonable. But after understanding the dialogue information, all these non-common senses seem to be explained. After all, there are few normal people. It can be said that they are all weird characters. The weird director made great works again.In the end, for the audience, we are all passers-by in the restaurant. We eat in the restaurant while enjoying these stories away from life. The most indispensable group in the world is the group that eats melons. In particular, the more fresh the story, the more we cannot bear our curiosity, and the more I want to know what will happen next.Of course, this is just the appeal of the story. The story comes from the script, so I say the script of this movie is great. Quentin's grasp of the rhythm and structure of the film is excellent. Only under the combined effect of the two, did this excellent work.In short, is the story too exciting, or are we living too ordinary.Like a lonely ant, peeping into the sparrow's eyes.","

"wolvesrug","9 January 2005","To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.","

Everyone in the film has a good quality, but they are hopelessly towards the dark and confused. Each paragraph is not divided into the beginning and the end, complementary structure, the beginning and the end of the connection, suggesting that the reality of similar movies in the plot is always happening, never stop. Line: why do we have to keep talking nonsense to maintain the atmosphere? Only when you find someone really special can you shut up and enjoy a moment of silence.","

"zacharyhamstra","24 September 2022","This movie may be the most overrated film of all time, in my opinion. There is no point. It is not particularly funny. It is not particularly thought provoking. It is not some kind of masterpiece. It is, however, well made. Has good acting with a great cast. Is a fun way to divide up the scenes and plots.I was ready for this movie to end far before it did, because I learned about halfway through that there is just no purpose to it! No meaning! I definitely enjoyed aspects of it and there was some legitimate tension, without question. It all just felt messy. Truly my favorite part of watching pulp fiction were two scenes that I had seen from different memes 100 times before, and never knew where they came from. It was a, ""oh, hey, I recognize this image!"" That was the most joy I got out of this.By no means is it a trainwreck, but to be considered such a timeless masterpiece of cinematic glory? Not a chance. I would like to speak to every single person who gives this a 10 and have them explain to me what exactly this film does well, because I feel pretty confident everyone just gets in line and calls it amazing because that is the 'cool' thing to do.","

"DemonKiki","16 April 2020","The postmodern discourse of the film, because it is in the post-industrial society era, is driven by the commercialization of the consumer society, thus embodying commercial, game, and popular colors. Jameson pointed out that the old (essentially advanced modernist) boundary between the advanced culture and the so-called popular culture or business culture has been abolished, and new texts have emerged that are full of forms, categories and contents of cultural industries. Bourdieu believes that the film has got rid of the shackles of classic art and has become a popular culture or a postmodern culture and has become a cultural capital. The purity of aesthetics and the self-discipline of art have been impacted. The tower of pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under the impact of popular art and its aesthetics. The ensuing is the appearance of popular aesthetics, and it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy.
Attracting audiences with popular themes, flattening the depth, everything is flat, this is what distinguishes the serious attitude of postmodernism from modernism. The result is to give the audience leisure, fashion, relaxation, surprise, and no tears. Violence, crime, sex and other generally considered vulgar themes are the themes of postmodern movies. Especially in terms of violent style, Tarantino became a single family. Violence has always been the unshakable theme of Quentin's works, and formed his black violence aesthetics. Violence is bloody, cold, game, and does not carry any moral and political responsibilities.
""Pulp Fiction"" thoroughly stylized and gamified violence. It makes the audience realize that at this moment, you are watching movies for entertainment, so Tarentino will turn violence into joke, sex into joke, politics into joke, and history into joke. It does not ask about the meaning, does not reflect, does not touch politics, not to mention resistance. The ""Bible"" quotes before Jules' killing were not intended to legitimize his murder. Similarly, the scene of Mia's overdose did not have any intention of exhorting drug addicts. ""Black"" has also been treated as a piece of joke. Both Vincent and Jules drove around the city in a car full of brains and blood. In order not to let the police find it, but also in order not to add trouble to their friends, they had to do it within 40 minutes. Cleaning the car is a very technical task, so that they have to hire a special problem-solving expert from the headquarters to guide them in their work. When the two big-hearted men finally washed themselves and the car Afterwards, while wearing two exaggerated and somewhat funny T-shirts standing in front of the camera, a scene full of blood and terror was transformed into a humorous sketch, and the popularity and gameplay are most vividly displayed here. So some people say: ""Pulp Fiction"" completed the transformation of violent movies from modernity to post-modernity, showing that post-modern violent movies have completely lost the power of social criticism, the depth and the profound connection between old movies and the real world. No longer carries the meaning of cultural symbols such as national mythology, heroism, social resistance, political complaints, etc. Some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out, leaving only the image itself. ""And the frequent scenes of violence in the film are echoing Its ""circular structure"" clearly states that the occurrence of violence is cyclical and never stops. ""Pulp Fiction"" tells us: In life, violence, including wars and boxing, is omnipresent. There is no justice in life and death, right or wrong in front of it.
Although Quentin Tarantino has never talked about postmodernism, he knows its essence. He seems to tell us that life in the 20th century is developing rapidly, changing fast and worthless. No one is immune. No matter whether life or death is unreasonable and fair Is a ""vulgar novel"", and this is where the subversive power of postmodern cinema aesthetics lies.","

"freemantle_uk","5 May 2008","Pulp Fiction is great movie, Quentin Tarantino's best. It is multi-layered, having a number of stories involved in the movie. The stories involved in the movie include Vincent (John Travola) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) going out on a hit and accidentally killing a man in their car and thereby having to sort of the mess, Vincent having to entertain Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman), taking her to a 50s themed restaurant and ends up taking a heroin overdose and Vincent having to save her life, Butch (Bruce Willis) crossing paths with gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and end up having to work together and a robbery of a restaurant by a couple which happens at the beginning and the end of the film.Pulp Fiction has many of the traits that make Tarantino such a good writer/director: there great dialogue and humour, there is a number of stories and Tarantino never tells a story straight (this was done in Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and Kill Bill), good casting, violence and a great soundtrack. Tarantino was also not scare to look at some dark plots such as male rape and the underbelly of crime. Because of Pulp Fiction Travola's career got a kickstart (a Simpsons' joke at the time was that Travola was working a 70's themed bar), made Samuel L. Jackson a household name and got him an Oscar and help made the careers of Uma Thurman and Rhames. Because of the way the story is set out Pulp Fiction needs to be watched a number of times, which in my mind normally a good thing because it makes you think and pay attention. It also has good lines in the film, such as the Royale with Cheese conversation and good moments of comedy and dark humour. A moment I really like is when Marsellus Wallace sees Butch in a car whilst he was crossing the road. As well because of the film I have the Fun Loving Criminals' song from the film on my iPod, with the beginning of the film as well.","

"flopezgraziano","26 July 2020","Quentin Tarantino demonstrated to the world the powerful ingenuity he possesses, and of which he boasts in every minute of this one, his best film, of 2 and a half hours of duration. The real magic of the film is that its viewing is short and leaves you wanting even more, despite its length. Another particularly attractive aspect is its black humour and ordinary situations.
Everything is incredible in Pulp Fiction, but without a doubt the most charismatic thing of all is its script, dividing the facts into chapters that were later imitated in other films by other directors and repeated with other films such as ""Kill Bill"". These chapters are not even exposed in a chronological order, which forces the viewer to fit the pieces of the plot, which would be difficult to describe.
The next strong point is the very famous cast with brilliant performances that raise the quality of the film to unattainable levels. In particular I want to express my admiration for John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in their roles as thugs/collectors (Vincent Vega and Jules, respectively) with unforgettable dialogues and discussions that are present almost at all times in their joint performance.
Another ingredient magnificently introduced is his soundtrack, with great themes, besides the mythical title song, including pop, rock and soul themes (I find especially elegant Travolta's dance song with Uma Thurman, by Chuck Berry).
In short, I can only say that I find no fault with this film and that I do not bring anything new that anyone already knows about this work. Unless Tarantino does something of this magnitude again, this is one of my favorite movies of all time10/10","

"saadanathan","15 April 2020","First thing's first, this is tarantino's most original and famous script ever written. the diffrenet storylines of the characters in the movie are so great you would watch them again and enjoy them just like the first time. all diffrenet story arcs clash togeter in unexpected ways. one of the main advantages of the film is the narrative that goes all upsite down, the narrative doesn't go from start to finish and it's better that way, it's a way of tarantino to tell his story in all sort of ways and directions. the characters were well written and my favorite character has to be jules, he had most of the unforgetable lines and was a key member in the movie. the soundtrack was terrific and definitely great for the tone and genre of the movie. the actors were fantastic with samuel l. jackson and john travolta at there best in thus masterpiece. so if the movie is so perfect why give it a 8? maybe it's not perfect in all categories and maybe some people consider it only to be one of tarantino's greatest but not THE greatest. I for once disagree cuase it is perfect and surtely the best of all.","

"jamiedarlow-37510","19 April 2020","An absolute classic in every sense and a must see for anyone even vaguely interested in films! A non-linear narrative following various characters including two hitmen Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield (John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson) a mob boss Marcellus Wallace and his wife Mia (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a boxer named Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). They all have stories that are seemingly unrelated but come together subtly through their lives intertwining. It's masterful cinematic story telling, holding buckets of style while also making time to explore its characters and delve into their personalities underneath the crime plot lines. The dialogue is insanely good and the lyrical flow of it keeps you enthralled throughout. I remember when I was a young kid fascinated by the grown up world of Tarantino's films. My fantastic mother let me watch all of his catalogue apart from this one until I was older (due to the distressing gimp rape scene) and there was so much built up for when I became of age to finally watch this masterpiece. It certainly didn't disappoint and it was my favourite QT picture to date. It's rightly become a huge staple in pop culture while also maintaining serious rewatchability and classic status.

"joshuafagan-64214","6 November 2015","If I may, let me note what a year 1994 was for film. This film. Shawshank. Gump. The Lion King. If someone came up to me and started ranting about how this was the best cinematic year ever, I'd actually listen to them for awhile before asking them why they are getting in my face. Of those films, this and Shawshank stand out, because they were not pre-established blockbusters. Gump and Lion King were expected to be pretty big, and just turned out bigger than anyone could possibly imagine. But these films were smaller, more personal projects. They are also quite different from each other in almost every other way; a notable one being that while Shawshank barely made back its budget at the box office, this film took off. Over the last couple weeks, with Steve Jobs and the like, we have examples of platforming failing. But it can succeed: this film is a prime example of that.This is important not just if you're incurably a nut about these sort of things, like am I. It means that this is the first exposure a lot of people had with a Tarantino film. I bet a lot of people became fans for life at some random matinée screenings some cloudy Tuesdays. This is one of those films that I would have loved to be there at one of its early screenings. A lot of minds were opened those days.I hope I'm not overselling this film, but it is one of those films that is so great that it is nearly impossible to oversell, which is a positive for me, as I love my gushing descriptions, as you might be able to tell if you read my review of Mad Max: Fury Road.One thing that must be noted about this film is that it goes out of order, and not a semi-organized out of order like Memento. This does not make the film hard to follow- it is easier to follow than Memento, at any rate- but it does make you think on your feet. Sometimes, I think that this whole movie is a then-young Mr. Tarantino taking a hunk of dynamite to the usual three-act structure. And it is glorious. No film better encapsulates the rush of exciting new filmmakers that we had in the 90s than this one.The title describes this film so well. It's not based on the style of blockbuster films. This isn't Jaws or Indiana Jones. This is darker, dirtier, less-universally subject matter. This is the equivalent of those books you keep for a trip to the doctor's office or the DMV just so you can be pulled out of the doldrums of life. It's not trying to be one of those Great American Novels written by Fitzgerald or Steinbeck that is typically only read by 'normal people' when they are in an English class or when they feel particularly scholarly.Of course, most of those novels were not particularly good, even at being what they are. This film is. It's clever, action-packed, well-written, and so much more. It represents a stark change from the happy-go-lucky (sometimes), subtle (often), and averse from breaking new ground (usually) attitudes of eighties movies and holds up a banner for nineties film. In the nineties, the same techniques that were developed for dark and gritty and serious movies like The Godfather or Apocalypse Now were being played apart the fabric of the mainstream. Yes, kids movies got even cheesier and less legit. But they no longer defined the market like they did in the prior decade.Artistic exploration became the norm. And few did that more than Mr. Tarantino, particularly in this film. Yes, if pulp fiction is what people expected, pulp fiction is what they got. But they did not get it in the way that they expected. To once more go back to MM:FR, I'm willing to be there were people who went into that film expecting to see just another action film in the style of the dime-a-dozen Die Hard and James Bond knock-offs that pop up so often every year. Their experience with that movie is probably on the level as anyone who came into this film expecting to see a mere piece of pulp fiction. This film is not a part of that 'genre', if you can call it that, but both an homage to it and its leading light. It transcends its grounds, its place in time, and perhaps even the medium of film itself. It is pure artistry.I cannot exaggerate how much of a breath of fresh air this was. Pretty much every problem with film in the eighties was given an antidote. It's also a good cure for everything from with major filmmaking today, though I argue that a more artsy version of the Hunger Games series would be a better one. But that's just me.As you might expect from a film that took off like this, it launched several careers and revived others, including that of John Travolta, who for once uses his overacting to his advantage. The soundtrack, of course, is phenomenal and iconic. Enough so that when I wrote the words Pulp Fiction down on the page, the first thing that popped into my mind was the title theme (Misirlou as covered by Dick Dale and the Daletones, in case you were wondering).Above all, when I watched this film, I felt a love for film and artistry, as well as a desire to build upon the works of the past while making a unique mark. It enraptures you in itself. Honestly, I'm kinda surprised that it took off like it did back then. But I'm not surprised that it's remembered today. It holds a unique place in society and is one of the definitive 90s films. Enjoy.","

"MovieAddict2016","3 April 2004","Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" is the quintessential example of great movie making, assorted using various constructive techniques that elevate the film to the highest possible level, stretching the boundaries and pushing upwards. Like all great directors, Q.T. lets the film and its subsidiaries stand on their own. A lesser director might employ cheap gimmicks and plot devices to move the story onwards at a brisk pace, but ""Pulp Fiction"" is a dark action, comedy, and/or drama that clocks in at two hours and thirty-four minutes. And not a single minute is wasted on material we think could have been shortened or cut. It's one of those rare motion pictures that leaves you wanting more, which only welcomes another immediate viewing to let everything sink in a second, third, or even fourth time.A lesser director than Tarantino might also force his characters into saying things they would not normally say, or into actions they would not normally act out in real life. Instead, Tarantino does something brilliant and seldom executed: He actually lets his characters evolve on-screen, and actually engage in every day conversations. Most critics interpret this as Quentin stopping to insert unnecessary (albeit entertaining) dialogue segments. They're wrong. The dialogue is strong, but it's there for a purpose. The difference is that dialogue in a movie such as ""The Presidio"" isn't real at all. The characters enter, move the plot forwards through speaking or acting, then proceed to repeat this in following instances, as if they're following the back of a mouth wash bottle (""rinse, spit, repeat""). Quentin does something else, by eavesdropping on his characters when their dialogue does mean something. No doubt Jules and Vincent have much to say about many things, but most of the time it is not relevant to the story. One must keep in mind that we actually hear little about Jules and Vincent, and even less talk between them. But when we do hear these things, it's strikingly true and purposeful. And this is what so many people miss when viewing ""Pulp Fiction"" -- the witty dialogue has become universally regarded as the strongest ever written, and while that may very well be correct, the idea that it is pointless is absurd. Quentin is subtle in the way he introduces his speeches; when Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) spend some two or three minutes discussing how the French translate the term ""Quarter Pounder with Cheese"" due to the metric system, it is amazingly deliberate: Quentin later uses this same reference for Jules before he and Vincent assassinate a group of young crooks who have stolen a briefcase from Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), one of the town's major kingpins.
There are essentially three stories in ""Pulp Fiction,"" intertwined between one another. It opens with Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and her boyfriend (Tim Roth) hatching a plan to rob a restaurant. By their reasoning, no one ever bothers with restaurants, just banks, so why not take advantage of them ""with their pants down""? The stick-up proceeds, which is when the famous titles roar forward and we find ourselves following Jules and Vincent, who work for Marsellus, who has paid championship boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) to fall in his upcoming match. But Butch has a better plan: Bet loads of money on himself, beat the other guy to a bloody pulp, and run away with his money. He almost gets away with it when he accidentally crosses paths with Marsellus once more, resulting in a rape scene to rival that in ""Deliverance.""Back to the dialogue. It is the driving force of the film, complementing the plot and allowing its characters to grow on us in ways we never imagined they would. It's the way in which the dialogue is deliberated that varies from most other examples of deliberation. For example, is it coincidence that we just so happen to overhear Jules and Vincent discussing the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese? No. But our instincts tell us that it seems very real, as if Tarantino went around filming real people, then edited together scenes where the dialogue could bear some sort of importance to the plot. There are different levels of dialogue -- plot-driven, and realistic -- but all dialogue is in service of its plot, just as all of what we say to our friends or family has a deeper meaning and will no doubt relate to the matter at hand. All dialogue relates to a larger scheme, and so does the dialogue in ""Pulp Fiction."" It's just more casual and subtle than most movies. It's not pointless, but it's not deliberate, which is a fine line to try and balance on. Quentin does so successfully, crossing the finish line with enthusiasm, which is no doubt part of what elevates ""Pulp Fiction"" above so many other motion pictures of its genre.5/5.","

"slightlymad22","11 August 2019","I just finished watching Pulp FictionTarantino nails his screenplay again. This type of talent is not taught at a screenwriting class. You either have it or you do not. Sadly too many people are making movies today, who do not have it, and there are too few talents like Tarantino.Too many movies these days just seem to say things to advance the plot. The dialogue here is genius, brilliantly funny (you laugh at the dialogue, even though he does not seem to be going for a laugh) and no two characters sound the same, everyone has their own way of talking. I'm appreciating the dialogue so much more watching them again.I think this was the first time I watched a movie that was so non linear. I think everything I had watched before this went from A to B with possibly a flashback explaining something. This changed everything!! After this we had great movies like The Usual Suspects and Monento. But it is not just the structure to Pulp Fiction that makes it great, it does not put a foot wrong.Whilst this movie revived John Travolta's career, it's Samuel L Jackson who steals the show. Every time I watch the movie I think he should have won the Oscar. Then I watch Ed Wood, and think Martin Landau deserved it. My opinion on this one, really comes down to which of the two movies I last watched.Harvey Kieren (in his second Tarantino flick) is great as Winston Wolf (I really wish he did not parody this role in tv ads) Tim Roth (also in his second Tarantino flick) and Amanda Plummer fun and I can not believe I never noticed it was Steve Buscemi (also in his second Tarantino flick) as the waiter Buddy Holly at Jack Rabbit Slim's.Pulp Fiction was a massive hit. It grossed $107 million (against an $8 million budget)
At the domestic box office to end the year, as the 10th highest grossing movie of the year.","

"Bologna King","17 August 2006","The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn't finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis' wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.Indeed, that's the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It's a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can't get the story straight and have to keep going back: ""Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . ."" I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don't think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that's why so much is so pointless.The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don't fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It's like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when ""Shut the f*ck up, fat man!"" is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy.","

"aarongnr","2 September 2019","While watching, I was about half into the movie, I thought: Ok, now I get why everyone loves this movie so much. It's funny and the situations are so absurdly entertaining. I kept thinking: Damn, I am so excited for that ending, which brings everything together and makes sense of it all.But it doesn't come. We just get a timejump to inbetween the story, showing us how to get away with murder and that continues the robbery from the start, this time with full context. But to what result? None. It has no influence on the movie whatsoever. And it wasn't the most interesting scene aswell.
One could argue that, had it not been for that ""miracle"" moment that we see in the flashback, and Jackson's characters decision to retire from the job, they would've both been in the boxers appartment, which means that the boxer would've died, and many of the other stuff would not have happened. And that IS pretty genius and really cool.Then again, there is stuff that was cool to watch, but that had really no influence on the movie as far as I can see. The whole sequence with Travolta and Thurman for example. It was fun to watch, because of Tarantinos awesome style for dialogue and stuff, but it didn't really add to the overall story.One could argue, that this movie is plotless, but I wouldn't go that far.It is very original and genius in some aspects, in others not as much as I would've liked.Cheers","

The characters are all so interesting from the smooth hit-man Vincent, the voluptuous Mia Wallace, the intense boxer Butch, the mysterious Marsellus Wallace, the criminals Honey Bunny & Pumpkin; and the greatest performance for any character; Samuel L. Jackson as the interrogate hit-man, Jules Winfield. All of the actors shined because of the fantastic screenplay Quentin Tarantino wrote to make these colorful cast of characters come to life by their dialogue that makes you glued to the screen even if what is presented ties to the non-linear narrative or not. This is best shown nearing the end when it is shown that neither Jules or Vincent are good men by any means because they go to people's houses, interrogate, and kill them without cause; but that doesn't mean that they have heart as through their hit-men skills, were able to stop two criminals from robbing a diner. That's ingenious writing as Tarantino knows that society are full of people who aren't heroes or antagonists; there is a division and altercation within cinema and reality. Coupled with throwbacks to classic films, and an unforgettable soundtrack, Pulp Fiction will remain to impress audiences and one that I and many others; will continue to enjoy for years to come. It has such a high re-watch value despite its length!","

"braddugg","19 September 2014","It's what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture. It's an important film and no doubt one of the most important ones to have come in the last 20 years. Not many films, threatened to change the rules of the game, as this film did. In terms of writing, it's non-linear, now non-linear in the real sense, it does not have a proper line of scenes or proper interpretation either, but they are connected by characters. This film has some iconic scenes which you will never forget. Like that, adrenalin shot scene to Mia (Uma Thurman) or reciting Bible's Eziekel 25:17 by Jules (Samuel Jackson).Though, it's nearly 2 and hours, its not long and seems short as they are many questions unanswered. So, is Vincent dead or not? What is there in that briefcase to Marseilles? And these are left unanswered. With just 7 scenes, you make a 2 and half hour movie that redefines in it's own way the perspective of the audience. So, I am amazed more than anything even as I watch it for nearly 10th time and the surprise keeps coming each time I see this. There is something that always works in PULP FICTION. But, what makes this film work is it's writing. It's writing like madness, there is no proper thing called this is it. It can be referred to anything and you may be right. The righteous man and the evil man interpretation is just a tiny example that can be taken out for how we can interpret a character. If I want to write one favourite scene here, it's gonna be the whole movie coz I like everything in it. Technically, I like the cinematography, sound design and costumes. But above all, I liked performances and dialogues. Thanks to Quentin who has given us more memorable movies in the last 20 years that are far superior in writing than anyone else. But for me, this is is my favourite Quentin film and I will stick with this till he out performs himself by writing something much more weird than this.A sure 5/5 for one of my favourite films, no less ever.","

"ChubbyChecker","9 April 2020","I like to think that any Hollywood director who dedicated their life to making movies can look back at one film and think ""At least I made my mark"". Kubrick had 2001, Scorsese will have Goodfellas and Tarantino, well, he'll have Pulp Fiction.I watched this film on release, when all we really knew about Tarantino was Reservoir Dogs. It's hard for me to think what someone viewing it more than a quarter of a century later would make of it. Hopefully it can be viewed in context and see how revolutionary the film really was.One striking thing, which was quite novel at the time, is how the scenes aren't shown chronologically. What at first seems like a gimmick makes more and more sense as the film progresses and on repeat viewings. The impact of the storytelling would have been nowhere near as great if told in a more traditional way.If you're new to Tarantino then lucky you, you've got some great movies to watch. You won't go wrong by starting with Pulp Fiction.","

"connorveenstra","25 May 2017","I don't get as much out of Pulp Fiction as everybody else does. I don't like that it doesn't have a strong message, I think the dialogue goes on self-impressed tangents some times and the Mia Wallace story doesn't tie in with the rest of the film and it just isn't that interesting to me. However, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate its style. The entire film from the costume design, to the camera work, to the setting of LA are dripping with noir atmosphere. The writing, while it does jerk itself off at times, is still pretty memorable and enjoyable to listen to. The acting is fantastic all around, getting especially good performances from Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Bruce Willis.While I don't think its a masterpiece, it is something fun to watch if you're looking for something different and intriguing.","

"rowmorg","18 December 2005","The hugely overrated trivial chatting, the grotesque violence, the moral vacuum, the deadly slowness, the length --- about an hour too long --- make it incomprehensible today how this picture ever made people rave the way they did on this board.The greatest film ever? Excuse me, this is a feature film that says nothing, depicts no authentic feelings or character development, is grossly self-indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations, such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly, simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law.Perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by Mr Tarantino, who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off.Where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense? Nobody in the film is remotely principled, and nor is anyone (except possibly the pawnbroker) actually evil. The scene where he releases a leather-studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a Hollywood feature.""It's only entertainment,"" I hear people protest. Well the difference between Mr Tarantino and film-makers of stature is that they are capable of entertaining while instructing, and of integrating the two.","

The movie stars some of today's biggest stars, e.g. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, and Ving Rhames.  Plus the absolutely hilarious and cool scene with Christopher Walken telling Young Butch the importance of a gold watch.","

"SnoopyStyle","18 December 2015","Ringo (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer) robs a diner. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are thugs working for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). They pick up a mysterious briefcase but an incident requires cleaner the Wolf (Harvey Keitel). Marsellus is paying Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to throw a boxing match. Vincent is told to entertain the bosses' woman Mia (Uma Thurman).This is Quentin Tarantino's big breakout. I saw this in the theater and probably even before 'Reservoir Dogs'. I definitely saw 'True Romance' before this but I had no clue who to praise for the dialog in that movie until I put two and two together. This is a cinematic explosion. Many tried to copy his style but none exceeded him. It is super cool. It's got the time jumble that adds so much fascination to the movie. Again many films try to copy it but few succeeds like this. It has to be one of the iconic movies of the 90s.","

"Chrysanthepop","3 November 2008","It's no surprise that 'Pulp fiction' is a movie that made cinematic history and defined the pulp fiction genre. It features a series of conversations and events coherently, but not chronologically, told. Tarantino tells three different but intertwined stories. Each of the stories are clichéd and have a noir feel but Tarantino gives them a different and unique treatment and adds sharp witty dialogues full of truth and irony (and references to many classic movies and popular TV shows). He uses a lot of warm colours and the film is slightly sepia tinted. Also there's a lot of attention to intricate detail and it is a finely layered movie such that one discovers something new with every subsequent viewing. There's also a certain ambiguity about it. It's not certain in which time the film is set or what was it in the briefcase that stunned Ringo...lots of questions and the answers are open for discussion. The cinematography is slick and sharp and the soundtrack is a classic. Then there's the outstanding cast that includes, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Rosanne Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, Maria de Medeires and Amanda Plummer, all of whom have a magnificent presence and memorable dialogue delivery. There are so many classic scenes that people discuss, even today. My personal favourites are the date sequence (and the scenes that follow) with Travolta and Thurman and the series of conversations between Travolta and Jackson. I doubt there's anything to say about 'Pulp Fiction' that hasn't been said. Whether one likes it or not, this movie is here to stay and even today it is among the most talked about movies. I have already seen it at least four times and it still amuses and fascinates me just like it did during first viewing.","

"guybrush105","4 April 2000","Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a ""tough guy"" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. ""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."" is my favourite quote.Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10.","

"CinemaClown","16 December 2015","Every once in a while, a film comes along that changes everything. Whenever the industry went out of ideas & employed the same formula for too long, there always emerged a new wave of films that injected new life into this medium and in the process ended up changing the way we are accustomed to watching & perceiving motion pictures. And Pulp Fiction is, without a doubt, one of those movies.Winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes & Best Screenplay at Oscars, Pulp Fiction was a force to be reckoned with at its time of release for it opened many realms that were previously thought to be non-existent and in the long run, didn't just influence cinema but other media as well. Everything about it was different from the norm and it remains one of the most original & groundbreaking stories to ever unfold on the silver screen.Pulp Fiction intertwines three different story lines into one and is told in a nonlinear fashion. The first follows two hit men who are out to retrieve a mysterious suitcase which belongs to their boss. The second is about one of those two hit men who's put in charge of taking care of the boss' wife while he's out of town. And third concerns an aging but proud boxer who is asked to drop a fight in exchange for a handsome reward. The lives of these odd people collide in unexpected ways, resulting in some hilarious situations.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, his sophomore effort is even better than his debut feature which was a milestone in itself. Tarantino has injected the script with extensive pop culture references, a vast line-up of idiosyncratic characters & explosive dialogues plus the way this whole story is narrated and its wicked fusion of violence & humour turns it into an endlessly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly refreshing ride that's in a league of its own.What's also amazing is the fact that most of the conversations taking place in the movie is not even related to the plot and is simply a casual discussion on a randomly chosen topic. And yet, without these wisecracking moments, Pulp Fiction wouldn't really be Pulp Fiction. The amount of focus that went into the smallest of details during the writing process is this film's biggest strength and when it comes to pure screenplay wizardry, Pulp Fiction has no equals & probably never will.The technical aspects are no slouch for the picture exhibits a number of new tricks when it comes to bringing the script to life on the film canvas. Cinematography presents Tarantino adding a few more photography techniques to his sleeve that would later become his own trademarks. Editing intentionally rearranges the order in which the events unfold and keeps the viewers on their toes at all times. And the soundtrack is a compilation of rock n roll, pop & surf music that are cleverly chosen and surprisingly fit the accompanying sequences.Two key elements that are highly contrasting in general but, in Tarantino's films, fit together as if co-dependent on each other is violence & humour. He's a rare artist who is capable of making us laugh uncontrollably at a scene that involves a person's head getting blown-off. Now there is substantial amount of violence in this picture but those violent sequences are also its funniest moments and the reason why it works so well is coz the addition of hilarity to such brutality significantly neutralizes the effect gore & violence alone may have had on the audience.Coming to the acting department, Pulp Fiction features a star-studded cast in John Travolta ,Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, & many more, and is notable for launching & revitalising the careers of many. Travolta resurrects himself with a smashing performance in the role of Vincent Vega. Jackson not delivers his career-best work but ends up reincarnating himself for this is the movie that made Samuel L. Jackson what Samuel L. Jackson is today and he will forever be indebted to Tarantino for this.Both Travolta & Jackson play the two hit men and their chemistry just clicks. Thurman plays Mia Wallace and is absolutely electrifying in her given role. Marsellus Wallace is a character whose presence looms over the entire story even during his absence & Ving Rhames didn't disappoint in portraying him. Willis adds another feather to his acting range and does nicely in balancing the toughness of his boxer character with a soft spot for his wife. Keitel steals every moment he is in. Roth & Plummer also have their moments to shine, and each one of them succeeds in bringing these scripted characters to life in just the right dose.On an overall scale, with its surprisingly powerful combination of unconventional structure, stylish direction, remarkable screenplay, stellar performances, energetic pace, mesmerising soundtrack and Tarantino's patented mix of violence & humour, Pulp Fiction succeeds as a delicious piece of pop culture that thrills & amuses in a highly unusual manner and is rightly counted amongst the greatest movies ever made. Immortal for its contribution to cinema & pop culture, an unsurpassed milestone in independent filmmaking, and a landmark moment in cinema history that permanently engraved Tarantino's name in the annals of filmmaking, Pulp Fiction is essential viewing in every sense of the word. Multiple viewings advised.","

"bob the moo","28 January 2004","Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are thieves who plan their next job whilst drinking coffee in a diner.  Jules and Vincent are hitmen in the employment of top man Marsellus Wallace who must retrieve a stolen suitcase for him.  Butch is a boxer near the end of his career who is ordered to take a dive by Wallace. Mia Wallace is Marsellus' wife who Vincent must show a good time while her husband is out of town.  In a flurry of violence, double crosses and accidents their stories collide in their world of murder, theft and drugs.It is perhaps easier to view this film now than it was when it first came out in the cinema.  At that time the TV schedules were full of interviews with Tarantino and lots of hype.  While it is still considered one of the best films of the 1990's, it is easier to watch it with a fresh eye now. The best film about the film is just how striking each part of it is.  The plot is well constructed in a weave of stories that all stand up well on their own but support other strands.  Often films that jump around within time will be hard to follow but here Tarantino does a great job of not only avoiding this but actually using his structure to propel the film forwards to good effect.The stories are never dull and, although some are better than others, they all pretty much stand up well.  The dialogue in the film could have been annoyingly inane - indeed at points I did tire of the constant pop culture references, but it mostly manages to engage and add to the characters.  It is consistently witty but open to sudden moments of action or violence that are all the more shocking for their suddenness.  There is a point where the film could have been better in the area of emotional involvement.  Most of the violence is met with laughter or interest by the audience rather than real shock or loss; the reason for this is simply that we don't ever really care about the characters on that emotional level - they are players rather than friends.  This is not a major problem as it is something that the pulp genre is happy without and in fairness Tarantino never pretends he is trying to do that.The only other problem with the film is it's glamorisation of both drugs and crime.  This would be a bit of a problem if I wasn't aware of the type of film it was, but I was and I just accepted it; like the man himself said `you don't go to a Metallica gig and tell the f**kers to turn the volume down', so too you don't watch this film expecting it to be anything other than darkly funny, violent and so on.The cast are very good in their various roles; nobody plays it totally straight and they all seem aware that they aren't playing this story in the real world but in a trashy world of pulp fiction hitmen, gangsters and their molls and so on.  Travolta is very good, it's easy to forget now that he had been in the wilderness before this film.  He gives a good performance and manages to make his character likeable without making him pleasant. Jackson impresses more in support and he deserved to win the Oscar that alluded him (`sh*t' he was seen to mouth in place of the usual `oh well done' fake smile!).  His character drive the main part of the film well and is enjoyable.  Willis actually acts here and does well despite not having that much of a range to deliver across.  Thurman is much better here than in Kill Bill and she brings her character to life reasonably well.  Rhames is imposing in his small role and the rest of the cast includes actors such as Whaley, Arquette (times two!), Stoltz, Gallagher, Buscemi, Walken, Greene and a wonderfully enjoyable turn by Keitel.  Tarantino makes a cameo himself and reminds the world why we prefer him not to act, but in fairness he is not as bad as he can be.Overall this is a great film.  It may be a little soulless and cruel if you are not expecting it to be a film that lives up to it's title and is `pulp fiction' but if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it a great deal. The interweaving stories and witty dialogue all keep the film moving forward and, while not a serious or worthy film in any way, it has a great narrative to it and is exciting and enjoyable.","

"pdortic","11 May 2018","Well my first review just accidentally got deleted so here is for a second go of it.. Pulp Fiction has an excellent ability to interweave multiple dissimilar narratives into one cohesive story. It has a knack for balancing tense, dramatic moments with witty, comedic relief. Scenes such as the pawn shop basement with Zed, the hit men's clothing change after hiding a body with the Wolf, and Captain Koons' monologue showcase Tarantino's warped sense of humor.","

"cartesianthought","20 December 2015","Pulp Fiction put non-linear out-of-order films on the map. With all of the films that follow a formula, it's good to see one that's essentially a puzzle you have to piece together. Each of the characters have some way of bumping into each other. As a departure from the grave tone of his first film, the indie hit Reservoir Dogs, this started Tarantino's signature style of excessively gory dark comedies with humorous observational dialogue. This film is bizarre, has some tense frantic moments, will make you laugh and is overall unlike any other film out there. It's biggest advantage, aside from Samuel Jackson and John Travolta having philosophical discussions about hamburgers, is the fact that it's volatile and it's completely impossible to predict what's next. This was a benchmark movie and, in some ways, a paradigm shift for the industry.","

"cutter-12","28 October 2001","The movie that defines the sensibilities of Generation X. That is to say its values are worthless, the story is lurid and over extended, the writer/director is overwhelmingly self-indulgent and tacky (any revelations to do with Christianity are twisted by Tarantino to fit his obscene sense of morality), the violence is absolutely incredulous, and the originality to do with non linear plot lines and everything else is greatly exaggerated (Try watching some early Kubrick to get an idea where he ripped it off. -- hell try watching 50 other trashy independent exploitation flicks from the 50's and 60's to see how much ""originality"" Tarantino has.) I'm not going to make any friends here, as this film has obviously snowed everyone who's commented on it, but who cares. Despite some extremely intelligent and powerhouse acting from Samuel L. Jackson, Pulp Fiction is a n experience not unlike having your face smashed into a urinal by a criminally insane biker in the bathroom at a race track between race four and five. It is an offensive and disturbing trip through the mind of a filmmaker who is as far from being a genius as the Earth is from Neptune. Quentin Tarantino is NOT Orson Welles. And Pulp Fiction is a film which only speaks to a generation pre-occupied with body piercing and anti-depressants. Make no mistake, I am more of an atheist than a Christian, but even I am outraged that people find deep meaning in a killer seeing the light and turning over a new leaf by letting the piece of garbage petty crook snake out the door with everyone's wallet he has terrorized at gunpoint along with his wigged out nutcase of a girlfriend you'd just wish Tony Minero would ice. If he truly was making a spiritual point and sincerely trying to do the right thing he'd have given Tim Roth his wallet, told him to leave the bag and apologize to everyone on his way out. Off to a flawed start as a Christian. And the fact that Tarantino lets us see that Roth and Plummer's characters aren't terrible people but just actors before they pull their heist is also a load of crap. Then there's the completely sickening LA underworld psycho scene (a personal Tarantino fantasy?) to do with sodomy and a couple of hillbillies which was done much truer and to better effect in Boorman's Deliverance. Does anyone truly come away finding this scene to be entertaining? And if so , if you're ever in my town please keep driving.Quentin Tarantino is truly one sick puppy. Sure, he DOES write some nifty dialogue if you can hear it amid the cacophony of MF and N words, but as far as talent for film-making goes he hasn't got an idea. He couldn't act his way out of a box made of wet tissue paper (Spielberg gave a better performance in The Blues Brothers) and visually he has nothing to offer at all. If anyone knows his influences, and he speaks of them often, you will know how all of the people he holds dear and in high regard (especially Howard Hawks) would phone the SWAT team on him rather than invite him to sit at their table.And to sum up my point, what can you expect from a guy who prattles on and on and on about how GREAT a film Rio Bravo is. Before any more Gen X and y'ers announce to the world that this is the greatest film ever made, PLEASE see some other movies beforehand!!!!!!!!!!!!!Start with Citizen Kane.","

"Sergeant_Tibbs","9 November 2008","I don't deny that this film is 100% entertainment and the dialogue is solid gold; but that would be nothing without the terrific actors. To be honest, I think the screenplay is massively overrated (although it is commonly cited as one of the best of all-time). It generally mixes ideas from lesser known films and used irrationally to create an ambiance of cool. Though this film is wonderfully cinematic, it must've been tremendously exciting back when it first premiered. I think its exploitation of violence and drugs is a tragedy, and although these consequences do lead to something bad, it doesn't disencourage them. I can't help but resent the film for the fact it's usually the film that gets people into film (can't disagree that it was one of the films for myself, but it has been 7 viewings since) since it offers absolutely nothing new, it just doesn't have a point nor is it a realistic representation of anything - not that I'd like to know, to be honest. If it wasn't such a cult film none of the images would recur. It has a pretty flawless soundtrack though. However, I cannot discredit a film for being overrated and what this film does preach does not offend me. I completely understand the acclaim it gets.8/10","

"CalDexter","17 July 2008","I will never understand why Pulp Fiction is hailed by so many as one of the greatest films ever made. Quentin Tarintino's first film Reservoir Dogs was amazing. It had excellent performances, some good action scenes, an impressive structure and fantastic sound track. When Pulp Fiction came out in my country in October 1994, i could not wait to see it. Empire Magazine gave it 5 stars. I remember when i went up to Glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.Oh boy, twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of Samuel Jackson's character. He just talked and talked and talked and....talked. John Travolta's Vince Vega was a guy i wanted to decimate, oh Travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with Uma Thurman in a silly black wig. There was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out. I have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage Jack Nicholson flick Wolf. Tosh.So i kept hoping that something good would happen...Christopher Walken as an army bloke talking and talking about a gold watch up his ass...NOT GOOD...a male rape scene with talk...NOT GOOD...Quentin Tarintino turning up in a cameo that should have got him shot (in real life) talk talk about disposing of bodies...oh, this film was the pits, i must have been the only one in the audience that hated this film, because everyone was whooping and hollering like they were watching a Naked Gun comedy. Oh yes, they loved it.Quiet frankly my admiration of Tarintino was gone forever, he got his head together with the brilliant Jackie Brown then lost the plot again with the silly Kill Bill volumes. Pulp Fiction is one of the worst movies I've ever had to endure, its a long boring ride to a sore head.","

Each story is interesting. The movie can go from intense to funny to just listening to people have a conversation in minutes or even at the same time. A very multi-genre movie and that adds to the rewatchability, you will catch new stuff each time and put pieces together on the multiple viewings. By the time the credits roll you will already be thinking about it and putting it together in your head. Very stylish when it comes to the great soundtrack and writing.

I really liked the heavy use of drugs in this movie, it gave me tears of joy to see characters having the time of their lives on drugs and made me very nostalgic for my drug fuelled happy days as a youngster at Eton (Mess).The heavy use of drugs, violence, profanity and sex in this film has positively influenced an entire sexy generation of British people and I can't thank the United States enough for that, from youngish Brits swearing every 5 seconds to the cheeky games of hide and seek finding marijuana in the London Underground and asking waitresses for free sex after every bad meal at restaurants, this film truly has changed British culture for the better, I'm so proud of the beautiful ex-British colony known as the United States due to this film.The sexual abuse at the end of the film has also made the UK more aware of sexual abuse of males, this film has made many Brits more self-aware that men aren't invincible, they can be sexually abused and this film highlights the harsh brutal reality of that heinous crime so I thank this film for making Britain a safer place for men. I also really liked the diner scene, the best diner I've ever seen onscreen and just so stunningly beautiful, it truly does look heavenly that place and every happy night I have I dream of going to that diner with a few of my British mates and gently bonding with our lovely American children.","

"one9eighty","3 February 2021","After the success that he had with 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs"", Tarantino came back strong with his second written and directed full-length feature film, ""Pulp Fiction"". Some would argue that this neo-noir black crime film is his masterpiece. Like his previous film, this offers just as much violence and brutality, which again is wrapped up with lots of style and substance.This film has seven narrative sequences, with three primary storylines, which are all interwoven, making it a hard watch for some people, while others marvel at its construct. Mob hitman Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is the protagonist of storyline 1, Butch Coolidge the boxer (Bruce Willis) is the protagonist of storyline 2, and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is the 3rd storyline protagonist. The film goes from a prologue (diner hold-up), to Vincent, Jules, and then Butch, before going full circle the epilogue and the diner hold-up again.I enjoyed this in the 1990's when I first watched it, and I've never shied away from watching it again given the opportunity. It might not be everybody's cup of tea and it certainly is not for the younger audiences (even of post 2020!), but I enjoy it and can appreciate its technicality. Having the benefit of 20+ years of hindsight it is interesting to see lots of films that have come out since and tried to replicate part of this film, most have failed too. It is a testament to how good this film is though that it can inspire other people to try, not just in film but other mediums too - games, comics, etc. If you have not seen this film it is absolutely worth a watch, and if you have seen it, why not watch it again and find something you missed last time - or discuss some of the themes, homages, or McGuffin's to try and work out your own messages (the gold light in the suitcase for example - I would love to believe it is Marcellus's soul. It ties in with the plaster on the back of his head, and with the combination of '666' on the briefcase - but this has been widely debunked). A cracking film and an enjoyable piece of art - one of Tarantino's finest films in my opinion.","

"Emmajoy93","13 May 2016","Pulp fiction is one of the best crime/ dramatic movie of my time. The movie had such a great cast, and some intense dramatic scene pretty much through the whole movie. I remember not liking this movie when I was a kid, but now that I am older I really enjoy watching this film. There are a lot of great scenes in this movie but the most memorable scene I think was when Uma Thurman and John Travolta are dancing on stage at the restaurant to "" You never can tell"" by Chuck Berry. Another famous and great scene is Samuel L Jacksons speech hes giving to the guy while shooting every one else. A lot of action shots in this film, drugs, guns, and violence. A very brilliantly shot film.","

"mrmystery99","29 April 2018","Would it be too much to say Tarantino re-invented the cinema with this film? I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone. You can tell - especially in gangster films - they never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most quotable dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, fun ride that you feel stoned/dizzy/drunk after watching it eachtime. Despite originally thinking it was slightly overhyped, seeing it again and again has brought me to realise what it is. It's 'Pulp Fiction' and it's amazing.","

"TedEBear","13 March 2008","After having seen how ""Pulp Fiction"" has infiltrated its way into current pop culutre (the dance contest, Royale with cheese, etc.), I finally got a chance to see the movie from the beginning and couldn't believe what a huge letdown it was. There was nothing for me to grasp to make me care about what the characters were doing and why they were doing it, and the overly gratuitous use of the f-bombs put me off completely. It's almost as if swearing was substituted for wit and clever dialogue. I felt like Tarantino was trying to impress me with how much of a movie geek he is, but if he tried to make a movie with an engaging story, I might have liked it more. The only person he's impressing is himself, and it isn't working.","

"SomaQuest","9 October 2018","I saw this movie nine times in the theater when it came out; it resonated so deeply on a level I couldn't explain at the time. Possibly it was the non-linear timeline of the plot, maybe it was the less-than-desirable content of the plot told in such an approachable way, maybe it was the easily memorable phrases and script or maybe it was the meticulously selected soundtrack that sourced from a host of decades and genres.The second directorial effort from then fairly unknown Tarantino but it was a brilliant sophomore effort hitting the proper notes on all the main categories; directing, score, cinematography, acting / casting, plot, writing, etc. I cannot suggest this film to everyone; you need a certain sense of humor and a certain means of looking at a plot-line to truly enjoy it, but for those that have those prerequisites this is required viewing.This film in my top tier and one that can be watched at any time. An extremely well constructed piece of film-making that is worthy of a viewing.","

This 1994 masterpiece is brilliant in all aspects; from the ingenious writing to the wildly witty dialogue to its captivating character creation; the overall excellence of Pulp Fiction makes it not only among the best, but maybe the most rewatchable movie of all time. Nearly every scene is gold and crafted to divine perfection. Pulp Fiction is truly a remarkable feat in the art of filmmaking.","

"xxxxxdarkmoon","9 July 2020","Perhaps the greatest movie ever made, due to the great actors and the script/story. Some of the coolest and funniest scenes ever. Very violent though. My rating is 10/10. It is defenitely in my top 3 of the best movies of all times.If you watch it for the 1st time, and didn't fully understand the high rating and the popularity of Pulp Fiction take my advice: The 1st time when I watched it, I didn't understand it. That was >25 years ago. I was like: what the heck is the story about? The 2nd time I suddenly got it:Pulp Fiction has the funniest and coolest dialoges and scenes with the most perfect actors of any movie I have seen. THAT IS A FACT AND WHAT MAKES PULP DICTION OUTSTANDING. Once again: .Pulp Fiction has the funniest and coolest dialoges and scenes with the most perfect actors of any movie.Tarantino created the most hilarious situations. Examples: the toaster scene - my favourite scene without any words..., that scene is incredible. Another one: Butch and Marsellus meet coincidentally at the traffic light. And everything that follows. Unmatched. Another one: the gimp scene. This is perhaps the best scene of the movie. I was on my knees laughing when they raped Marsellus and he was about to think about a revenge,the scene when John Travolta meets Bruce Willis inside the club, epic. And so many other scenes. The most famous actor
of the 70 ies was perhaps John Travolta due ro Sarurday night fever and Grease. Travolta used to be an idol of mine. My generation of a mid 60is born Baby Boomer.But this role of Vincent, is the role of his life. I think, most of all the actors in Pulp Fiction playing the role of their life.If you dojn't get the coolness and fun and the perfect story on the 1st watch, give it another try anytime later on. It is mostly about the scenes and the atmosphere and these hilarious situations. But the story is perfect a well. What's in the suit case? It is something really valuable. That is the only thing that matters. It doesn't matter. If its money, drugs or jewels or anything else. It is something they kill for. That is what matters.","

"Boba_Fett1138","31 May 2004","Quentin Tarantino had done it again. If you thought he would just be an one day fly after ""Reservoir Dogs"", you couldn't be more wrong.Once again just like in ""Reservoir Dogs"" the storytelling is unique. The movie has several different story lines that are all in some way connected and to make the story even more complicated, they are not told in the right order. It sound like the story is hard to follow, how ever this is not the case. The story is easy to follow, so everybody should be able to see the brilliance of it.The movie is filled with sex, drugs, violence and bad language. All of this combined makes the movie one of the most kick butt movies.All of the stories are great and wonderfully written. It's amazing to see how they are connected. The stories are not typically Hollywood like, meaning that they are not predictable and don't follow the Hollywood movie rules. What makes the stories even more great are the dialogues. The movie is filled with the famous trademark Tarantino dialogues and is a true pleasure to listen to, they are very raw and realistic, just like the characters. Brilliant dialogue!There are countless classic scene's and some of them are up there with the most classic out of movie history.The movie is filled with some great music that sets the movies mood.There is a big all star cast with actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Phil LaMarr, Frank Whaley, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken. Having such a cast is already a signal that this is more than just an ordinary movieA must see unique movie.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"ving13","5 August 1998","Tarentino's masterpiece has sent shockwaves through the entire film industry.  So many films are clones of it, try to imitate the dialogue, or hype, where applicable, their stars ""of Pulp Fiction fame."" Pulp Fiction features dialogue that rings true to life, unpredictable plot turns, and plenty of humor.  To best enjoy this movie, know as little about it before viewing it.  The non-linear plot serves a purpose and is not merely a gimmick.  It puts the most fitting part at the end of the film.  Truly a historic film in many ways.","

"aljabman","12 October 2020","It's not a film it's a experience. The characters are very memorable The story of nonlinear dialogue and action no the whole movie is fast and fun there's no down time or anything boring the movie is long. There's more then 10 memorable scenes that is referenced in any type of media. I like to think of pulp fiction as resvoir dogs another film by the genius tarrintino as a better version of it. I thought resvoir dogs had the coffe scene at the start and mr white hurting the police officer. I thought the movie was stretched out more then it needed to and the ending gave me such a poor taste in my mouth. I still like it, like I would get a poster or t shirt of resvoir dogs to show my opinion. There did you see that I lost focus that's what pulp fiction does it makes you forget about the world but remember about the experience. The scene where butch reclaims himself in the eyes of walleces is a redemption story in itself about how we can all get together without fighting and being greedy. The part where 2 scenes ( tiny bit of a spoiler but watch Pulp fiction now if you haven't) where somehow at point blank range a revolver didn't shoot Jules and vincent and somehow Vincent shoots one of the guys in the head on accident. Thats a message life is like a box of chocolates the things you never expect will happen. Another part of the idea is the violence and sex violence plays a big part in this movie these are horrible people that everyone loves when I see this film I feel like it's a LEGO set controlled by tarrintino everything goes together like cause and effect yet while still being random sex is not that big in the film expect for the epic scene where butch remdeems himself and when butch is making out with his girlfriend but that scene was still great because he had to find his watch holy crap. This movie has dialogue lots of it and that's fantastic he is known for dialogue the tarrintino himself said that dialogue is a major component in his films and it shows, other films have such poopy dialogue where all they do is talk about nothing like get on with it. Pulp fiction is the story of 3 as 1 and should be hands down the number 1 film of the millennium .","

"jackamccallum","29 May 2019","Pulp Fiction is clever, funny, well acted, well directed, thought provoking and extremely entertaining. Best performance of Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta's careers as well as an amazing addition to Quentin Tarantino's Filmography. The film is darkly comedic and makes you laugh hysterically over moments that you would otherwise not find amusing. The dialogue is sharp and witty yet feels very realistic for most of the film (occasional monologues aside). The film can make characters seem like total bad-asses just by having them eat food (in this case a burger) and can make you sympathize and care about horrible people. The film is extremely entertaining with no scene feeling like it goes for too long and every moment serving a purpose in the overall narrative. It is widely inventive and there is a reason people give this movie so much praise. All fans of movies and general cinema goers need to give this film a watch at some point in their life.","

"robsta23","23 November 2015","This film may play with its use of chronology, and it may be episodic, but people generally claim this movie to be great because it is the first to do so. It is certainly not the first film to do either of these things. It is inspired by many films before it, such as Rashomon - which tells the same story from four different perspectives - as well as ""My Life to Live,"" a neorealist film which is told in twelve distinct episodes. However, Pulp Fiction was the first film to play with chronology in this manner in many years, and it is because it does so with great purpose which helps to make it my favorite movie (among various other reasons).Some complain about this fiddling with chronology to cause confusion, yet the story only goes out of the linear time line in two spots in the film, and I always found it easy to follow. As for the BIG episodes in the film (the ones Tarantino actually gave titles to) the first two are played in chronological order, and the third episode shown jumps back to a spot before the other two stories. I will not got too in depth with my next comment as it would give too much away if I did, but Tarantino's choice to show Butch Coolidge's story (Bruce Willis) before Jules' story (Samuel L Jackson) has a huge impact on the way the audience views Vincent Vega (John Travolta) by the end of the film. It is this fact combined with the way Jules' story ends that left me mind-blown when I watched this film for the first time.I understand that in the context of 1994 when this film was released that it was an extremely violent film. If you're still going to complain about the violence in this film today, I would laugh and tell you there is no way you could handle more contemporary films like Mongol, 300, or Gone Girl. Hell, I hope you can make it through Django Unchained, Tarantino's most recent and by far his most violent film to date. What people forget to say about the violence in Pulp Fiction is that most of it actually happens off screen, leaving the violence up to the audience's imagination (maybe this is why people remember it to be more violent than it actually is).What I realized and loved about this film after watching it for a few times is that the three stories of this film all have a common connection - they deal with loyalty to a father figure, each one more intimate than the last. We have Vincent Vega struggling to be loyal to Marsellus Wallace (the crime boss), we have Butch Coolidge honoring his father, and we have Jules Winnfield rethinking his relationship with God.Other than the chronology of the film, what is easily the most notable thing about Pulp Fiction is the dialogue. Tarantino has arguably written better scenes after this film (in fact, I agree with his choice of the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds as his favorite thing he has written), but this is the movie by Tarantino that EVERYBODY quotes, especially the famous scene when Jules dominates the conversation about breakfast and what Marsellus Wallace looks like (trust me, even if you haven't seen the movie you've probably heard a friend quoting this scene). Tarantino is a master of dialogue - he writes conversations that people might actually have with each other. The topics may seem random, but that's how real-world conversations work. You discuss events, make analogies, disagree and argue - you don't simply talk about what is going to happen or what has happened, which is unfortunately how a lot of dialogue in film goes. Tarantino always creates distinct and well-developed characters through his use of dialogue.This movie is a roller coaster of an experience, and it gets my highest rating.4.0/4.0","

"gigan-92","3 June 2010","Grade: A +Is it a redemption story? If so, of human nature, or the characters themselves? A simple buddy film where action and comedy is spliced together? HELL NO!! This film has a left mark ever since I saw it. It was so different, so humorous, and yet so moving. All of this in one genre that is in itself truly hard to define.Tarantino has truly written a masterpiece. This film in reality tells three stories, which one such as myself, upon first viewing, found confusing. What can I say; it was my first Tarantino film! But after watching it several times, as I have also done, it really starts to hit you. Simply said, it really is a redemption story. Our characters are hit men, drug dealers and proud users and crime bosses. They make a living off killing and sin. So, in essence they are the ""bad guys"". And yet the audience is drawn to them due to the comedy they use. The dialogue is so rich and original we get to see two hit men talk freely about foot massages right before busting a mission, and yet it isn't regarded as silly. What other film can do that; none!In fact, it is these moments that give ""Pulp Fiction"" that flame. Perhaps the best example of this savior of the human soul theme is Samuel L. Jackson's character, Jules. His performance is probably the most vivid in the movie. Every line he utters is a testament to what Tarantino envisioned. The human soul is a vile corrupt thing, but it can be reformed. It can be saved. But one has to be willing to make that change. Many times it takes a miracle for us to realize that and to make a change. It can even be our destiny to save the souls of others, as the final scene depicts with Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer). There are cruel consequences that fate can play against those who refuse their destiny, as the tragic case with Vincent's death.The cast is spectacular. John Travolta and Uma Thurman (Mia) have a genius yet troubled 'love-story', twisted with temptation. Christopher Walken appears as Captain Koons and Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace. My favorite actor besides Samuel L. Jackson has got to be Harvey Keitel, who is known only as the Wolf. Every actor brings a different emotion to the film, really spicing it up and making it a varied film.One of my personal Top 15 films ever, ""Pulp Fiction"" is widely entertain and will invoke the curiosity of movie goers for years to come.","

"aplato","6 November 2000","Pulp Fiction is a good, well-acted movie that is way, way, way over hyped by its fans. The core of the movie, the blathering of Vincent and Jules is fun and enjoyable. Bruce Willis as a hot-headed boxer does an excellent job communicating his fear and desperation. In the end, the movie's quirks and twists are merely to make a rather run-of-the-mill arthouse film seem more edgy. There is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. However it is not the amazing Second Coming of Christ as many Tarantinophiles would have us all believing. Many of the components are merely there to make us, the audience, gasp in horror or gaze in amazement. Do we REALLY need to watch John Travolta stick a needle in Uma Thurmond?  Yeah, sure it was cool at the time but that coolness quickly wears off when you realize there is really nothing likeable about any of these people.","

I had no idea since the film epitomized non-sense making. Someone died, and I didn't like any of the characters, with the exception of Whaley's, so I would still have wanted to cheer), bad writing, with obvious attempts at being ""cool"" and trying to have ""catch phrases,"" etc etc etc! I found nothing good about this film in the least. So why did critics? I hate when violent, immoral films are regarded as ""daring"" ""good"" film making. This one sure wasn't, and nominating John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson for acting awards?! The first one is just absurd and the second has proven to me that he can act, but the only thing he was acting in this film was obnoxious.

"schroeder-gustavo","9 December 2015","Pulp Fiction made Quentin Tarantino who he is today. He showed us what he was capable of with Reservoir Dogs, but with Pulp Fiction, he made his mark in cinema and it will stay there forever. I love Pulp Fiction, I love it so much. It's just one of those movies I could watch on repeat for the rest of my life and I wouldn't mind it. But what makes it so great? It's basically just a bunch of people talking, the entire movie. But it so well scripted and directed, the Pulp Fiction script is perhaps the best script ever written. Royale with Cheese? Hell yeah! Everyone in film school should read the script to this masterpiece. Needless to say, all the actors in the film have reached iconic status and deliver great performances. Pulp Fiction is one of the most iconic movies of all time. What makes it so great for me is the fact that it's not really about anything. It's just a bunch of random stuff that happens and it has a great script, that's it. But to make a movie about nothing and make it one of the greatest, most entertaining films of all time, is an achievement. Thank you, Quentin Tarantino. Thank you.Written and directed by Tarantino, it's considered by many to be one of the most influential and best movies of all time. In my opinion, it is the best written film of all time. Pulp Fiction is a film driven almost completely by its dialogue: It's two and a half hours of mostly people talking and one would think that's a negative but the dialogue is extremely clever and engaging. The performances are brilliant as it features a pitch perfect cast. The directing choices are awesome, the cinematography is perfect for what it needs to be and you can't talk about Pulp Fiction without mentioning the soundtrack. Possibly the greatest soundtrack in a movie ever. The dialogue is so good it features so much quotable dialogue.I'm a big fan of structure in most movies but the beautiful thing about Pulp Fiction is that it's not really about anything. It's just a bunch of stories mixed together to create an entertaining film about gangsters, dancing the twist and foot massages. There is only one scene in Pulp Fiction I dislike, because I really feel it does not advance the plot and it feels like it slows the movie down for me and that is when Butch and his girlfriend are in the hotel room at night. The scene lasts like 5 minutes only at it feels like it could have been trimmed to two. However, this is really a minor detail. Pulp Fiction is one of the most entertaining movies ever made and it is an essential viewing for any film lover in general.9.7/10","

It can be done. Why do this? Because if you do, you will see what a nothing movie this really is. There is no central plot, there is no real theme, or story or climax. It is just a bunch of tricks and overly snappy dialog, masquerading a piece of fluff that has as much depth as the kiddie pool. Hey, more power to Tarantino, the guy is a Houdini, full of slight of hand. But are we really so simple, that we are ranking this one of the ten greatest movies ever made? Come on! OK, I know that Travolta is cool and Jackson is funny. However, let's reserve the greatest films of all-time category for real masterpieces and real stories, and not some overly slick pulp geared towards video store geeks.","

"Jakemcclake","5 August 2009","Spoilers This movie says that life sometimes sends a message from God so we should listen. This plot moves in and out of several related stories and the time-line jumbles around so that the way it is presented, it enables us to see the hand of God. We see justice served and spirituality wins out and the evil gets killed, and/or embarrassed and/or other nasty things. We start the movie in a restaurant and watch a husband and wife robbery team begin a robbery. There are two hit men in that restaurant. We move in and out of a story of the two hit men who work for a mobster named Marcel. We watch the hit men pull off a hit and get the money that the victim (played by Frank Whaley) owed the mobster Marcel. I got a real kick out of Whaley repeating ""What?"". The hit-man points his gun and says: ""Go ahead, say ""What"" again! I dare ya! I double dare ya! Then Whaley's character says ""What?"". BLAM! He is shot in the leg.We watch as one of the hit men Vincent Vega (played by John Travolta) takes Marcel's wife out on the town, per Marcel's orders. Vega fears his boss Marcel's jelousy. Additionally, Marcel's wife ODs. Then we watch a frantic rescue effort bring her back. We watch as a boxer (played Bruce Willis) is told and paid by Marcel to throw a fight. Instead this boxer pummels his opponent to death in the first round. Then he attempts to gettaway with the help of a lady cab driver, who was turned on by the killing.There are many more surprises in this movie and a reason why I called this ""Evil Blood and Guts Meet Up With Spiritual Redemption; and WHAT?"". Every minute of this movie should make you look at the screen with your eyes opening very wide and quote Frank Whaley's character ""What?"" This is easily one of the best movies ever and many have tried to repeat it, but never come close.","

Today I want to write about one of my favorite and many times revised American crime thriller 1994 ""Pulp Fiction"". The director of this film is the incredible Quentin Tarantino. The duration of the picture is two and a half hours, they fly by as one minute. The cast is very strong: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis and a lot of other great actors that I love and respect. A bouquet that is necessary! I really like the work of Quentin Tarantino, his style is always very different from others, it is difficult to confuse with someone else. Perhaps this picture of all his most cool. The film has everything you need to have fun. Bright actors-stars, atmosphere, humor, dynamics, music and much, much more! This film is memorable from the first time, but you still want to review it. Everything is unrealistically cool, romantic, unusual and interesting. I look and take my breath away. I know all the dialogues by heart for a long time, they are simply incomparable! All the movements of the dance Uma and John have long learned and danced. Who hasn't tried to repeat them? In general, it is very difficult to find fault with something in this film. In my opinion, the picture is perfect! I don't see the point in retelling the plot, everyone knows it anyway. And if there are those who have not seen the picture yet, then I strongly recommend it to raise the mood and get pleasure. I hope that those who love this film very much, I just decided to remind you about it just in case. I wish you all a great mood and a lot of positive emotions. Thanks for your attention.","

"Michael_Elliott","19 August 2011","Pulp Fiction (1994) **** (out of 4) Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough about the underside of the L.A. crime scene and focuses on stories involving a couple hit men (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson), a down and out boxer (Bruce Willis) and the big man's wife (Uma Thurman). Over the course of a matter of days their lives all get connected in this roller coaster ride of a movie. If you're looking for warmth or heart then it's best you stay away from this movie but if you want a brilliantly constructed story dealing with people who often don't get movies made about them then PULP FICTION is just for you. Yes, crime movies have always featured these type of violent men and women but no screenplay has ever gotten inside their head or tried to show what killers talk about while they're on the job. The dialogue is what really seals the deal on this film and it certainly deserved the Best Screenplay Oscar that it won. The stories are told out of order, which is always a tough way to tell a story because you can often confuse the viewer or make it so frustrating that the viewer just gives up. Tarantino's stories are so well structured that you never get confused as to what's going on and being able to see how some characters end up before we get to the actual ending, which in fact takes place earlier than the ""real"" ending works very well. There are so many classic scenes to be found in this movie but some of the highlights include a terrific dance sequence between Travolta and Thurman to a Chuck Berry classic, an adrenaline shot sequence and of course the classic Biblical quote delivered by Jackson. As great as the screenplay is it offered many people a jump to their career and this was certainly true for Travolta who really gets to shine here. When this movie was released it was considered his first great film in years and it gave that career and major boost but it's a shame he hasn't done more with it over the years. Jackson became known as that ""Bad Motherf&*&er,"" which perfectly sums up his performance. Both Thurman and Willis do a great job with their roles and the supporting players are all extremely good as well. PULP FICTION truly is a cult classic that delivers on the suspense, the laughs and it really just makes you feel as if you're looking in on a group of people who you'd normally never be in the same room with. Add the great soundtrack, the wonderful cinematography and some terrific homages to older movies and you've really got something original and special. Tarantino's influence of the crime flicks from the 70s and the Europeon crime films is so apparent yet he takes these moments and makes them his own. PULP FICTION really did change the way movies were made and it was a real eye-opener when it was first released but like most masterpieces it also keeps getting better with age.","

"SulphurMan","30 September 2003","Ill go on record and claim that Pulp Fiction is probably the best motion picture Ive ever seen. After you have seen Pulp Fiction, things are just different, whether you like it or not. Other films seem empty, boring, un-creative, formulaic, and bland compared to this monster. What happened with Pulp Fiction is more or less a pop culture phenomenon. This film single-handedly set the blueprint for every other film that followed it. Everything from high budget epics to teen romances draw on aspects of this flick. Some incredible things came with Pulp Fiction, and almost 10 years later it is still sending tremors throughout the motion picture industry. Compelling and comedic dialogue, brilliant editing, top notch acting, bravado directing - this film encapsulates everything good, fun and clever about the filmmaking process and audience interaction with a film. Tarantino gets career high performances from John Travolta, Sam Jackson and Uma Thurman. You put these people under any other director and look what happens...not a whole lot. What happened with this movie was nothing short of pure genius on all counts. What you get here is a collection of entertainment, shock and disbelief. All of these things swarm into your mind as you watch this, and surrendering to them is enjoyable. How many movies could you just listen to? Ive had this movie on in another room as I did other things, and it was still pretty entertaining. The dialogue is obviously what sent this movie over the top, and with good reason - it is quite simply incredible. Its hard to summarize my thoughts coherantly on this one...It is THAT good. If you havent seen this, rent it, watch it and enjoy it. Its one hell of a ride.***** out of ******","

"filipemanuelneto","21 January 2023","This was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino's career and made him one of the ""superstar"" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don't think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn't call it regular, a ""safe bet"", but we can't deny it, it's original, true to his style and doesn't seem concerned about pleasing anyone.The film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe.For many, this film is one of the best of the 90's. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It's reasonably good, it's gained cult status, it has fans, but it's not a masterpiece, not for me. It's not a boring film, it doesn't tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There's a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it's something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn't matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot).These are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the ""pulp"" literary subgenre. I'm not, it's not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn't like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn't... watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible... it's the kind of ""literature"" that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn't know by heart.The actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn't bad, but he's just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I'm sorry she couldn't go further, but that's life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn't. He's a ham as an actor.Technically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well.","

"foxhound-37781","14 March 2021","What's there to say about Pulp Fiction that hasn't already been said..... Multiple tales of crime and corruption and robbery put together to create what seemingly is 3 or 4 short films that are interwoven, but done so in a way that just works so well.Shot in and around LA, every actor in this movie plays their role to absolute spot on perfection. No one feels out of place or out of character for one second of this film, and there are some serious big name actors in this considering it was only Tarantino's second film. even HE himself plays a very believable role.The only downside is sensitive folk might find it a bit gnarly hearing white people use the ""N"" word with sustained use, but it's certainly nothing that ruins the film to the state of it being unwatchable.Pulp Fiction has an awe inspiring cult following and so it should. It's just the perfect movie from the 90's. It's one of those rare gems that just has EVERYTHING on display you could ever want in a film. It doesn't feel outdated and it doesn't feel overacted. It's a little bit of a long one at 2 and a half hours long but you really don't notice it because you enjoy it so much.10/10 Could watch it endlessly and never get bored.","

One of the most celebrated and acclaimed movies of all time is a damn masterpiece.Pulp fiction is one of my favourite films ever and for good reason:
-the amazingly genius nonlinear story telling
-one of the most enjoyable performances of all time from Samuel l. Jackson.
-and of course the dialogueLook, as someone who has seen all of Quentin Tarantino's great contributions to cinema history I can officially declare Pulp Fiction is still his best.

"zanghi_james","28 May 2019","Quentin Tarantino made a nice splash with his cinematic debut of directing Reservoir Dogs. And less than five years later, he followed up with another wonderful non-linear masterpiece that not only lived up to the previous films performance, but outshined it as well, appropriately called Pulp Fiction.Much like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction is not for everyone. There is an incredible amount of cussing and swearing as well as violence and disturbing imagery. There are some callbacks to the style of Reservoir Dogs as well with the violence, like not showing the violent boxing match that is the main point of Bruce Willis' character's story in the film is definitely a callback to Tarantino not showing the botched diamond robbery in Reservoir Dogs. Some of the scenes of violence are so out there, though, that they are almost like R-Rated scenes from a Three Stooges short, most notably the scene where Uma Thurman needs to be revived from overdosing on Heroin. However, don't expect such comedical style all the time, since there is that one scene with Bruce and Ving that is like Deliverance was directed by Eli Roth.As usual, the casting choices of the film are spot-on. Ving Rhames, who I really only have seen else in the Mission Impossible films, plays a great, tough, and much more likable gangster than Lawrence Tierney in Reservoir Dogs. John Travolta's character, despite doing a great dance scene, plays a pretty despicable bonehead who gets his comeuppance in a nice satisfying way of gallows humor. The true star is Samuel L. Jackson, playing a good-natured and loyal gangster who, following a slightly botched job, gets a better view of his violent life and decides to get his act together. The cameos are, as usual, really cool, also. Bruce Willis plays an okay tough guy in this one also, though his tantrum when he loses his watch is a little out of control. I mean, I agree that the watch is critically important to his character, but he didn't have to blow up at his girlfriend like that...And of course, the soundtrack rocks.","

"DigitalShark1","8 December 2015","This film is a masterpiece in filmmaking. The Idea of taking one event and watching it from three different perspective is a genius idea on it's own, but this movie takes it a step forward by adding amazing characters and incredible dialogue. This film is a masterpiece. Some people complain about the violence, but I think that's actually a huge strength. The film isn't scared to show some blood and it represents how horrifying some of the scenarios are. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson do amazing performances as the Hit-men. Tim Roth from Reservoir Dogs is back and performs a killer performance in this film too, and of course Bruce Willis is Fantastic as he is in most of his movies. Expect for Die Hard 5, but that's another story.All in all, This film really knows how to be original is not telling a three act structure story and instead telling a very clever idea and a very clever story. But what else do you expect from one of the greatest directors of all-time, Quentin Tarantino?9.75/10","

"the-fearless-america","12 May 2016","This is one of movie that raising Tarantino to an apex level. He was so young that day, but already mobilizing his career expeditiously. Reservoir dogs, his first movie, is one kind of movie, using a similar 90s retro theme. Those style was an inheritance of Tarantino, it was his original natural-touch. His 90s movies severely enjoyable for young and mid-aged people. Nowadays, his 90s movie prevalent considered as trend-setter which used by so many directors nowadays, for example lets look at kill bill. Stylish but harsh with slow-mo action shot and consider the raid 2 and kingsman : secret service as its descendant.Pulp fiction is a film which considered as classic. Lets try to analyze it distinctly. First thing first, i am gonna highlight the performance of Samuel L Jackson. Indisputably, Jacksons performance is potent. You cant contest this level of characterization without any serious contemplation, because in this movie, Jackson ranked highly in top performance of all time category. Even an amateur audience could say this level of acting is above average. I even feel scared by his act (interrogating scene), its like I've been really charged by a verdict and witness him ready to gut me was really haunting and obnoxious.Secondly, the writing. Honestly, the plot could drive me from not in a mod into a freak. The joy element implicitly delivered from the writing to the audience. The interrogating scene, driving scene (in early duration), and of course the magnificent dancing scene. All these scenes were devoted by great screenplay technique. For example lets take a look and analyze the interrogating scene. Watch and remember Jacksons movement and watch the camera position carefully. At early, Tarantino using some establishing shot and some full-shot to all characters inside. It brings an introduction message while giving suspense to audience. Jacksons movement from outside the door to in the middle of the room to in front of sofa is a support to these shots. It sends horror expression to the interrogated characters. Then lately, while berating and punishing Tarantino using close-up shot and extreme close-up shot to execute. These give a huge pressure and impoverishing the morale of interrogated person. The force of pressure intensified by slow-paced play as Jackson moving. Those was an example of incredible screenplay and writing technique. This technique also used by legendary director Sergio Leone to his western movies.The 90s euphoria direction was the highest aspect of this movie. It shape the whole film with joyful nostalgic of 90s, such as the music and pop culture. The nostalgic invention of this new movie in 90s permeated to the whole audience until now. It persist as a classic nowadays. Tarantino was a terrific boy these day.","

"Lukec1229","14 December 2015","This film was a wild one. Definitely blew my earlier expectations of it out of the water. The way in which it is told is brilliant, with non-linear, seemingly random, disjointed plot lines, that all come together and manage to tell a story of their own. It's an extremely violent, drug filled, dirty, gritty, crazy film about crime, but it's also full of great, witty, and intelligent dialogue and it's full of minute things and details you may not pick up on at first. It was an entertaining and darkly humorous film, but it's also an intelligent and revolutionary one that broke new ground, that I'd definitely recommend watching it at least once.","

It's #8 on IMDB's top 250, it has a score of 8,9 and it has tons of positive reviews. After seeing it nearly a month ago I told myself ''I was right!''The acting is excellent by everyone. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are the highlights in the cast and this movie helped their careers a lot. Bruce Willis gives one of his most memorable performances ever as a former boxer that ends to go out of town with his girlfriend after saving his former boss (Ving Rhames) in a holdup. Uma Thurman shines as the boss' wife and in supporting roles Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette and Tim Roth are very good and entertaining to watch. Quentin Tarantino's direction is top-notch and the cinematography is slick and stylish. The soundtrack is great and memorable. The only complaint I have is that at times there are some violent moments, but since it's the only problem I cut it here.Since there are more than 2,800 reviews for this movie already I won't try to give a deep analisys or discussing the plot. Just watch it and enjoy.","

"jefadlm-1","2 January 2021","I submit this film is actually ( albeit crime ) actually a redefined renewed genre ! As in R D this narrative takes risks in its
style of of story telling which is virtually a Tarantino invention ! yes it is true of course, every director has his or her unique
style of moulding and honing their story , Tarantino aims his tails in a unique mix of his own well thought out concoctions .
I cannot think of any examples , but anyone who loves cinema will have seen some films that failed in their attempts to
copy Tarantino. Therefore, that statement , it seems to me , is clearly indicative that this director has always triumphed
over all attempts to either go one better than him or out fox Tarantino in the hope of overpowering his style of sculpting .
That is how uniquely brilliant Tarantino is, similar to Gaugin or Michael Angelo he is a true artist in his creations
As has already been said, to try and get some level of comprehension of this film , it needs to be seen a number of times.
The same appreciation and more clarity of understanding is precisely the reason we continue to learn more and acquire
more depth of real academic learning every time we return to the National Gallery in London or the equivalent American ,
Italian or French art galleries . Every viewing of the Mona Lisa we see something previously overlooked, or did not previously
fully understand ! The first page of training for a successful film director comes from his or her hours and hours of intimate study
of form, substance, and colour , of photography also. Kubrick began his career as a monochrome photo journalist , thereby learning
about framing and all the artistry that follows that ! Tarantino i suggest either had a natural eye and sensibility of form, or ( possibly and )
studied from a very early age, as much as he was able with regard to form, framing and colour hues ? And only at a slightly later time in his younger days started writing story lines and ideas ?","

"LebowskiT1000","21 February 2002","What is the big deal with this movie?  The movie SO boring, uninteresting, and full of a bunch of moronic and trashy characters.  I just don't get why people like this film so much.  It truly saddens me that this film has, for some god-awful reason, made it into IMDB's top 250 (and currently top 20). This film is most definitely in my bottom 250.Here are some of the many problems I had with this film:The scene where Bruce Willis' character was first introduced is one of the most visually painful scenes I've ever seen, I was ready to turn the movie off right there.  The camera just sits there on Bruce Willis' face and doesn't move for what seems to be an eternity.  What on earth was Quentin thinking?The best way to describe this movie is ""just a bunch of STUFF"", there's no real plot here and the story doesn't go anywhere?  I found it really hard to give a SH*T about any of the characters, and I couldn't care less if any of them got shot or killed.What was with that scene where Uma Thurman's character says ""Don't be a square"" and she forms a little square with her hands (If you haven't seen the movie then you won't know what I mean)?  That was so STUPID!!!  I just don't get stuff like that.  Too weird for me. ...And people call this a comedy?  Where the f&*k is the comedy?  Is it supposed to be funny when they go over the speed bump and shoot the guy in the back seat?  That isn't funny, that's SICK!  The only part that I laughed at was when John Travolta and Sam Jackson were talking about eating pork/bacon.  I thought that was a pretty funny conversation, but other than that I didn't find the movie funny at all.I'll never say ""don't waste you're time"" while referring to a movie, cause everybody has different tastes. So if you feel so inclined, go ahead and watch it, but I HATED it.  I hope you enjoy it more than I ever will. Thanks for putting up with my ranting and raving,-Chris","

Brilliant and engaging, endlessly quotable and visually alluring, PF made all the top lists, regenerated John Travolta, solidified Bruce Willis, centered Samuel L. Jackson as a leading man and cemented Christopher Walken among creepiest of cameos ever. The side characters are more accessible and reminiscent as friends of ours then they are as plot worthy points of interest. They discuss everyday trivial matters intensely while the viewer is wondering about the ramifications of the events just watched or know is around the corner.... and we actually see very little violence play out! Tarantino's use of the chopped up time line only added to the Pulp mystique as well as it's charm. Imbecile gangsters charming? Regressive American social interaction cinema worthy? When combined , it remains a perfect storm for Quintin & company.","

I don't know why this movie has been so successful with critics. The movie is a piece of the s word. It's up there with movies such as the Star Wars movies, The Godfather movies, and The Silence Of The Lambs as being some of the most over rated movies ever. The only Quentin Tarantino movie I loved was Django Unchained. That movie is amazingly good. The others from him I've seen range from awful to so so.

"thesar-2","30 December 2009","""Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead."" Pulp Fiction has to be one of the best crafted movies of all time. Sure, it's out of order and some people (including some dear to me) got confused, but it's so well made in the sections it's presented, it deserves to be on the top of all people's best of lists.Yeah, it contains violence and a lot of it. Some language and it's excessive. And believe it or not, for being a ""guy's movie"" it contains full frontal male-nudity (thanks, Bruce.) But, it's creative, inventive, original and a helluva lot of fun.There's a dozen or more subplots to explore, but for the most part, it involves the zany adventures of Vincent (Travolta) and Jules (Jackson.) They're enlightened hit men or simply, employees of one Marsellus (Rhames) and they're on a mission to retrieve a golden briefcase. In the interim, they accidentally shoot someone, get shot or dance off with a drug addict.To be perfectly honest, despite the previous paragraph's spoilers, there's so much going on in this movie, it's hard to describe everything that happens. Needless to say, you MUST see this movie.It contains the following: excellent acting, great comebacks/tributes (Travolta and Stoltz amongst others,) wonderful dialogue, comedy, cinematography, soundtrack, score, originality and enormous breakthrough for a director/writer (Tarantino) who is likely to go down as one of the best directors/writers of all time.I have practically memorized the soundtrack and quotes. And even the joke involving tomatoes. It's rich and deserves an audience from the 1990s to present. Perhaps Tarantino didn't know what impact he would have with his ""fictional"" story. But anyone that's seen this knows what a master he was when he created this world.I have no problem for saying the following words: Alfred Hitchcock is a favorite of mine. Tarantino is drawing very near to the master Hitchcock was. As crazy as Tarantino may appear, he knows what he wants, he knows how to spin an extremely creative yarn and he doesn't seem to care if anyone else agrees. To me, I hold him in the highest respect for his visions.","

"scarlettwyrtzen","4 January 2021","This movie may be very ínstense but the plot is amazing. Watching movie's that go full circle like Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind or Inside Llewyn Davis.
This movie is Quentin Tarantino's best.
Mia's overdose is scary but iconic, the dance scene is probably the only reason that John Travolta got the role, or Marcellus Wallace's band aid on the back of his head.
This movie is great, a little crazy and ínstense but great. If you are still not convinced it has JOHN TRAVOLTA AND SAMUEL L JACKSON AND UMA THURMAN AND A BRIEF SCENE WITH HARNEY KEITEL AND A BREIF SCENE OF CHRISTOPHER WALKEN AND BRUCE WILIS. Oh, and Steve Buscemi plays Buddy Holly at the finer than Mis and Vincent dance at.","

"bowmanblue","20 August 2019","It may sound odd finally getting round to 'reviewing' 1994's 'Pulp Fiction' as there's really little that can be added to everything that's been said about it over the years. Yes, it's a true masterpiece which has - and will always, I would imagine - stand the test of time. But is it for everyone?It's Quentin Tarantino's second film as writer/director and, even with all the greats he's turned out since, most people will say that it's probably his best (and I'd agree). However, if there's actually someone out there who hasn't seen it and doesn't even know anything about it, how would you describe its story? I guess you could call it a 'gangster' film with various stories which span different characters which are skillfully (if loosely!) woven together. It's also filmed out of 'chronological' order, meaning that a character may die halfway through, only to return later on in the film simply because the end of the film is technically set before the mid-way point. Confused? Stick with it. It's worth it.If you check out the main poster associated with 'Pulp Fiction' you'll see the - now iconic - image of Uma Thurman's character to sell it. Even though she is indeed a 'central' character to the plot, you'll notice a whole load of famous names in the small print, including John Travolta, Bruce Willis and - of course - Samuel L Jackson (in what was totally his 'breakout' role). This is definitely an 'ensemble' cast and, due to the multiple story threads, not all these names will be on screen for as long as you might like them to be. However, that doesn't mean that anyone turns in a bad performance.'Pulp Fiction' has made it's mark on not only the Box Office and takings, but also on popular culture. It's either quoted or lampooned to this day and most people will 'get' any references made to everything from the numerous quotable lines to the crazy outlandish settings the characters find themselves in.Due to the extreme circumstances involving very 'adult' themes, this film is not for children. And it's all the better for it. This is because it will - hopefully - limit those who just don't 'get' it. For all its greatness, it's not an easy watch. You can't just have it on in the background while you idly check your Instagram account on your phone. You really need to invest your time into your viewing to get the most out of it. Because of that it's not for idle viewers. It's made to be watched properly (and then debated afterwards, no doubt - people still wonder what was in the briefcase to this day!).If you're not a fan of violence, bad language, drug-usage or films that play with the element of storytelling in order to mix things up a little, then you may find much of 'Pulp Fiction' a little hard to watch. However, even if you're not sure about it, I would advise at least giving it a go, simply because it one of those rare films where audiences and critics actually agreed that it was a 'true' masterpiece. Plus, as I've eluded to, Samuel L Jackson's performance is worth a viewing on its own, let alone with all the other amazing performances as well. They don't make them like this any more. Even Tarantino has never - quite - managed to recapture what he managed here.","

This was Tarantino's break out flick, and as much as I love reservoir dogs I'm happy that it is. I'm let's face it, this is still his best movie. I can gush about the performances, specifically Jackson because my god is he great in this. I just wanted to mention Travolta, who disappeared after the Grease and then was crapped on after 'B:E' and 'Gotti'. He's not exactly my cup of tea but even I can admit he is great in this

"khanbaliq2","25 June 2010","Brilliantly written and unfathomably cool, this would make a good case for most quotable crime film of all time. Interlocking stories from the seedy side of Los Angeles include ruthless hit men, a gangster's beautiful wife with a roaming eye and a boxer who refuses to take all.Pulp Fiction is the defining film of the 1990s, playfully mixing up its chronology, packed with memorable, snappy, cute dialogue and showing a genuine zest for the art of film-making. Director Quentin Tarantino's film-literacy, learned obsessively during his stint as a video-store assistant, pays off handsomely here; almost every line is quotable, a sense of fun pervades, there's a host of delightful set-pieces (including John Travolta's and Uma Thurman's sexy dance) and generous screen time is given to characters rarely considered at length in film, such as Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson's stolid hit men. Briefly, Tarantino shone brighter than anyone else in the industry, and this film justifies his accolades.","

"cooplander","8 December 2004","Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film.","

"alishahmohd","22 November 2013","For the people who are not aware of the concept and the style that Quentin Tarantino uses for most of his movies, Tarantino's films involve a lot of blood, violence, strong language and profanity and most of his films are not told in a continuous manner they keep on switching between time periods like Past and Present. Tarantino takes his style and concept and pushes it to the absolute max in Pulp Fiction and this resulted in arguably the greatest film he ever made.Pulp Fiction tells 3 different interrelated stories, with one main character, the first story's main protagonist is Vincent (John Travolta), the main protagonist of the second story is Butch (Bruce Willis) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) is the main protagonist in the third with Vincent playing a very strong supporting role. The film also includes a prologue and epilogue and these stories are also shown non chronologically. This film uses such a unique format, that chronologically the events of the epilogue take place just moments after the prologue and the three stories told in the middle take place before or after the events of the prologue/epilogue. Pulp Fiction is one of those films that would have perhaps not been as entertaining if it had been shown in a chronological order, it's non linear format of storytelling is definitely one of it's highest points keeps the viewer thinking and interpreting. This is a major benefit because the viewer can just choose to watch one story at the time and still be entertained and will still feel like that he watched a short flick and there will be a sense of completion. All story's can also be re-watched chronologically to watch the film from a different perspective. The film can also be re-watched in the current order it is in to comprehend the film in it's entirety. The film's replay value is tremendously high, I watched it around 10 times and always found it entertaining.Pulp Fiction does not hold the viewer on the edge of his seat to find out what will happen next, but to think about what transpired earlier and what led to the current situation. For example: Vincent and Jules went to do their job ,all dressed sup in suits and couple of hours later they go to bar to meet their boss in shorts and t shirts, at first I thought it was a glaring oversight but this is heavily explained later on and I was extremely surprised with the events that led to this sudden change of attire.The film's three stories are not that in depth or engaging neither is the overall plot of the film, but the plot is still funny, interesting and keeps us engaged throughout, the three stories also inspired by short films that Tarantino is a fan of, brands that Tarentino loves and B Grade movies that Tarentino likes they all appear, this is a Quentin Tarantino movie through and through and his fingerprints are all over it, he himself makes a cameo in this film, and despite not being a trained actor does a decent job. The dialogue is the film's greatest point, some really awesome, fantastic and memorable dialogues are spoken throughout this entire film that they are being quoted to this very day. This film does not want to directly take you into the action, when Vincent and Jules first went to do their job, they didn't get directly into they talked about a series of unrelated events which were all interesting to listen, they are criminals about to commit a crime, but to them it is just another day at work, they are co workers and friends and they are gossiping. Another example is Bruce betrayed Marsellus Wallace and killed someone, he is on the run but decides to smoke in the hired cab and discuss with the taxi driver in detail about what he just did. Another example would be us Bruce Willis going around his house's yard, rather than the film directly starting the scene with him entering through his house's front door, in the yard scene the camera focuses closely behind Butch to keep us on the edge of out seats and expect someone to attack him, although nothing happens.Pulp Fiction has many pop culture references and also involves some serious and controversial subjects likes miracles, drugs, mob bosses, taking dives, betting, homosexuality, rape all these subjects are depicted in the film. The soundtrack and full length songs that are used are really good and just are fun to listen, the main theme and ending themes are also excellent tracks.The acting is fantastic, Samuel L Jackson steals the show with his natural roles as Jules, John Travolta regains his former glory and fame with his excellent performance as Vincent, Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace was also great and Bruce Willis is also portrays the Butch character very well. There are many awesome cameos throughout the film where the actors deliver their lines and perform their roles almost perfectly my favorite however must be Christoper Walken's short cameo and the sentimental story he tells about the Golden Watch. All other minor characters like Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer also do a commendable job n their short roles.In conclusion, I want to say that Pulp Fiction is an astonishingly unique film which does not have a deep story and there is hardly any morale to the story but a tremendously entertaining film, with a fun plot, brilliant and absolutely mind blowing dialogue with tons of pop culture references and social commentary. It is simple a Masterpiece without a message and arguably Quentin Tarantino's best movie.Overall: 9.5/10","

"Cristi_Ciopron","9 July 2009","Do not, my fair reader, be put off by the countless jerks who already affiliated themselves to the PULP FICTION cult, and this not because there's yet some room for still more jerks to join the cult but because there is much more in PULP FICTION than what meets the mimetic jerks' eyes. On KANE there's a crust of _academism and bores' gossip, on PF there's a crust of nastiness and jerks' ineptitude. And for one thing, daddy Tarantino is a true director—the way a Lynch or the Coens are not. Now admit it, fair, lovable reader—what if PF were no more famous than Omar the Tentmaker, Old Ironsides, Tarzan and the Golden Lion, The Princess from Hoboken or The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini? Now wouldn't you cry masterpiece and claim that Tarantino is an ignored genius? I call this the GONE WITH THE WIND test—take a movie that you think is overrated and then pretend or imagine it's unknown—what would you feel? The false thesis is that it could serve as a substitute for the '70s trash classics; it will not. It's not an updating or upgrading of the '70s cult flicks.It's a treat, it's straight wonderful; the performances are gold, the script is indeed fine. It has zest, gusto, true storytelling, some awesome action and some nasty violence—and an enjoyable score.What if PULP FICTION were as famous as Isle of the Snake People or The Utah Kid? Liking this movie does not mean binding to the fashion—but acknowledging the obvious—and I do so joyfully—you can also see it as a Willis movie, that's what I did, consider PULP FICTION as primarily a Willis movie, one of Willis' most distinguished roles.","

"digdog-785-717538","24 June 2011","It took me next to twenty years to review this film appropriately; i should say, it took me the best part of ten years to realise that not everyone might see it my way. Under close scrutiny, the world of cinema goes this way, more or less: Kurosawa, a Japanese, and two italians, Fellini and Antonioni, subvert just about every rule that Hitchcock laid down; then nothing else happens for thirty years, with Hollywood slowly draining the life out of world cinema (see Transformers 2), until a guy called Quentin Tarantino released this second film, after the poor (or great, if you are a traditionalist) Reservoir Dogs, called Pulp Fiction. And it obliterates every rule that every filmmaker across the civilised world ever tried to establish.John Travolta takes flight to a role so high across the sky that no reviewer is ever going to be able to demolish it, no matter the angle. This is the role that will inspire humans for the next two hundred years; this is the Shakespeare of the modern world. The first director to utilise black actors effectively. The first example of 100% quality production after the dust and sweat of traditional Hollywood arenas. Pulp Fiction is a film of such incredible intricacy that it's unfathomable to anyone but a big-brain film school student, and even than, who knows. Do not feel ashamed if you miss its finer points. But for history, this is the one, the only, the film that takes over from Yojimbo, from 8 1/2, from La Nave Va, from Shichinin no Samurai, and more ... and just moves on forward. There is more film in twenty minutes of PF than there is in the whole of a typical Hollywood production of the 70's. So there are those films above this one. Space Oddissey. The Godfather. These are just targeted products. You will never find someone who has a coherent film critique of Pulp Fiction. Mastery in work, spark of genius, there is no way that this film can be any less than 10/10 and the best film ever made.","

"brenttraft","19 February 2001","It seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film Kiss Me Deadly.  Kiss Me Deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object.  The main difference in style was that the humor in Kiss Me Deadly is much more subtle, while Pulp Fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction. Because of that, I feel that Kiss Me Deadly is the far superior of the two.","

"Mhenegan26","8 September 2013","Pulp Fiction is one of those movies I liked more in retrospect than at the time. I think Tarantino's genius does play a part in this film, and the product is substantial; but Reservoir Dogs is better.All the characters use witty, random dialogue about European hamburgers and the sexual implications of foot massages, but to what avail? I mean, as fun as it is to hear and watch, I just found that the whole movie lacked something. Maybe a little bit more editing would've done the trick; maybe it was something else. I can't quite put my finger on it. Don't get me wrong. I think this is a classic Tarantino movie. I enjoyed Samuel L. Jackson's quotable lines, as well as a couple of outstanding scenes. (The OD, the Big Date, the scene where Harvey Keitel gets rid of the body, etc.) As a whole, the movie does work. But some minor details would make it even better.The storyline of Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames was a little much. (Did Ving *really* have to get raped?) I know Tarantino just wanted to add some shock value to his film, but even for a person who doesn't mind that kind of thing in movies I found it a little extreme.Oh, and one more thing: I learned that ""zapateria"" means ""shoe store"" in Spanish, courtesy of Butch. ;-)HandHStudios Rating: 8/10HandHStudios","

"buiger","14 March 2012","I really don't know what the big deal is. This is obviously another one of those ""highly intellectual"" movies I am too stupid to understand. The critics compare it to ""The Godfather""... I find that to be sacrilegious! I agree with one critic only when he states that the film ""presents meaningless issues in an intensely-fascinating and almost lyrical fashion"", and I would like to put a big emphasis on MEANINGLESS!!! How can something meaningless be good?Another famous critic, Roger Ebert, claims ""Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst. Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one..."" That is amazing! One of the world's most acclaimed film critics watches a 'masterpiece', and right after that cannot decide whether it is really a masterpiece or garbage? Then he goes on to say, 'oh, but it can't be garbage if such an in-director made it, so it must be a masterpiece'. So much for competent individual judgment... I suppose you would not be able to call yourself a critic if you wrote that Tarantino simply screwed up this time...In my opinion, the film has a ton of famous actors, an ""in"" director, and nothing else. The plot is practically non-existent, there is no message, no ""higher"" meaning, nothing but violence for the sake of violence..., and above all, it does not entertain either!

"jbirtel","25 August 2002","It must tickle Tarantino to no end to read or listen to all the self-proclaimed 'experts' who dissect and analyze every scene, shot and line; and apply their religious or mythic interpretations; then proceed to pat themselves on the back for their ingenuity. Yes...this movie is chock-full of subtexts and inside references (and plenty of homages to movies past), but the bottom line is: it's not so much original as it is combining so many elements of comedy sketches and classic Story chestnuts wrapped in some great soundtracks. And the results explode like a blast of fresh air. So just sit back and enjoy the ride!Not that there is anything new to his approach. 'Citizen Kane' (non-linear story) and 'American Graffiti' (scenes written to fit an existing soundtrack) and even 'Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein' (The comedy/horror movie) are just a few examples of popular re-inventions. But Tarantino's approach are more like reminders of combining many more elements of great movies (or great movie scenes) and making those reminders seem like re-inventions. Is there anything wrong with that? Not a chance! Not when the end film has so much wit, intelligence and energy. It's time for guilty pleasure!Every actor (to the small bit parts) is perfectly cast, to single one performance over another would be an unjust slight. This is not a competition of who comes off best, this is a massive group of a labor of love everyone involved must have relished (including the technicians) so that the story comes first and everyone has their chance to shine when it serves the story to do so. The direction, camera angles and editing causes the movie to unfold much like a book, which may qualify it as being a visual 'page-turner'; you can't wait to see what happens next. And just when you think the movie is going to turn right; BAM! off it goes again on another left turn. This was one of the first movies I'd had seen in a long time that I wasn't able to predict on what was going to happen next (with so many movie cliches where the hero gets violent revenge 'At The End', the hero's side-kick is killed off two-thirds of the way thru, the damsel in distress stupidly allows herself to being captured, dialogue that is 'dumbed-down' to appeal to the (so called) mass).To get the most from this entertainment, it's best to know nothing about it other than the info on the DVD jacket. To reveal ANYTHING is to rob yourself of a great movie viewing (and listening) experience. So...you won't find any lazy re-hashing of the plot in this review.The ""Collector's Edition""('s) DTS sound is fantastic and is a huge improvement over the 5.1 Dolby Digital's earlier DVD release. If you love the movie, then you'll enjoy the wealth of bonus material.(Very subtle spoiler) Alright! I'll indulge just this once, concerning the contents of the briefcase. I don't buy the voodoo religious suggestion that the case contains the soul of Marcellous Wallace in spite of the 666 or the band-aid on the back of his neck (a happy accident for interpretation because actor Ving Rhames had a scar that needed covering). I've heard gold bricks; an Oscar; even the holy grail. I think Tarantino just put a gold glow there to create massive theories and arguments (brilliant ploy). BUT, if I had to pick: taking into account the director's love of movies, the characters' reaction and subsequent action to steal it (including Brett & party; especially Pumpkin's reaction: ""Is that what I think it is??"" which Jules confirms) I wouldn't mind thinking that the contents refers to the 1941 classic directed by John Huston that begins the story in 1539 of ""a Golden Falcon encrusted from beak to claw with the rarest of jewels"" and how history showed what little regard some people placed on the value of human life to gain its possession. NOW...everything fits into place! But, that's only if I HAD to pick.10 out of 10! Probably the movie of the decade.","

"stebird","11 August 2017","An epic landmark in film making brought to you by everyone's favourite madman Mr Tarantino..., Pulp Fiction is one of the most influential films of the last thirty years and maybe of all time. Quentin Tarantino became a cinematic auteur after only his second film and lay down the yard stick for which all other directors strive to be; a completely original film like nothing seen before, revolutionary at the time and still revolutionary now, maybe more so?It non-linear form of storytelling was a masterstroke, adding something unique and dynamic to the crime story contained within, on the surface Pulp Fiction's plot would've been samey and flat if not for the magic Tarantino threw at it.On a whole other level is the dialogue, Tarantino's legacy will include his unique approach to making everlasting and brilliant dialogue, Pulp Fiction is the perfect example of realistic yet overly tongue-in-cheek usage of the spoken word. The opening scene with Jules and Vincent driving along to their next job is a shining example, talking about the most obscure and silly things like what do Europeans call a quarter pounder with cheese..., a Royale with cheese, because of the metric system, in my view this is one of the greatest quotes in cinema, stupidly simple and random but so effective.The acting is sublime and masterful, John Travolta's performance alone relaunched his career and made him an A list star once again..., it also has to be the shining light in Sam Jackson's career, he was given the ball and he ran with it truly, announcing himself to the world in the process.The side story involving Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge added another amazing dimension to an already incredible film, and Tarantino expertly linked the story in to the rest of the film like a pro.Cinematic excellence and it just goes to show how well independent films can be if you give them the chance, an independent film by a relatively unknown at the time director has gone on to become one of the most critically acclaimed films of all time and for very good reason.Essential viewing for any budding film fan, a film that must be near the top of every list..., one of the best ever, I salute you Quentin Tarantino, cinema is a better place because of you sir!","

Many movies may have one piece of dialogue that elevates the movie enough for you to like it, but Pulp Fiction is sheer joy of conversation, paired with situation after situation of pure excitement.I am sure I will never seen a movie that will be this much fun again! In fact, this movie alone has convinced me that Tarantino has to be the greatest movie maker of all time. This is my go to movie when I can't make up my mind what to watch; I am guaranteed satisfaction!The movie has no plot! It is a collection of out-of-sequence stories that make up the last few days of the life of a hit man, played by Travolta. That's it! He and his partner are simply taking care of an errand and it goes wrong, while he also has to take his boss's wife out for dinner to keep her entertained while he (the boss) goes out of town for the night. That, too, goes wrong. Every single thing in that movie just goes horribly wrong and it's just fabulous.The acting is compelling. The cinematography is masterful and just sets a nostalgic mood that makes you want to return to. The direction is ... oh well ... Tarantino. And the dialogue is the best ever.

"lutzkevinandrew","18 November 2015","Brilliant! Quinton Tarantino has out done himself with this film and its a must buy. His ability to place the audience in the middle of a crazy story and wrap it up at the end deserves recognition. This Film is full of amazing actors who make everything work beautifully. It is so hard to choose which character did the best job because their was so many. Uma Thurman, John Travolta, and Samuel L. Jackson in my opinion did the best. Watching this film for the first time requires a lot of attention as well as applause. The Cinematography was excellent and the ability for scenes to flow in such a way really is a work of art. Definitely a 9 out of 10 if not a perfect 10. Nothing can be changed to make this film better.","

"Det_McNulty","18 June 2007","Following the success of 1992's Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino released his finest film to-date, the self-proclaimed masterpiece Pulp Fiction; a film which is arguably the most influential of the last few decades, and one which stands alone as a ""to-be"" classic. Pulp Fiction remains widely regarded as one of the essentials in modern cinema, which has established itself as a film for the lovers of cinema, as those are the people it gets its greatest amount of admiration from. Pulp Fiction marked the new-wave, avant-garde cinema, it became recognised for its vigorously exciting flavour and unfathomable cool. Revolving around a deconstructed narrative, composed of three stories, which are all insanely surreal, Pulp Fiction brings you inside a world Quentin Tarantino has successfully crafted through individuality. The film starts with a lavishly entertaining conversation of tension and wit between two robbers, one being Tim Roth and the other being Amanda Plummer, who kick-start the film with furious energy. This scene is then followed by the infamous conversation of Amsterdam and burgers between the justifiable ""cool"" of Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta). From here on in you have entered a world fuelled by greed and missing-morality. Sure, Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly one of the ""coolest"" and ""hippest"" films around, nevertheless it holds much, much more than that. The film stands as a piece which depicts the psychology of normal people who have been thrown into extreme circumstances, meaning their personalities have changed along with their situation. It is a film which is much than amusingly clever on the surface, as in fact Pulp Fiction juggles allegory, such as the ""freedom"" of Amsterdam being a counterpart for the film's non-conformist, disobedient nature. The film has countless recurring themes, such as redemption, vengeance, spirituality, morality, individual morals, and a person's mannerisms. Even behind the film's humorous anecdotes there is still a lingering sense of haunting poignancy the film throws upon its viewer. The inviting environments are simply an innovative showcase for a study of one's ethics and the dealing of horrendously problematical situations. The characters are all vigorously layered, with multi-dimensional emotions and spontaneous behaviour. When I say that every actor performs with undeniable perfection, I mean it. From Christopher Walken's cameo as Captain Koons, to Bruce Willis' alpha-male, yet kind-hearted ""boxer-thug"" performance. Everyone in the film sets themselves a back-drop for their character, letting every character differentiate between one-an-other. Yet, as Harvey Keitel states in the film, ""of course you're character, but it doesn't mean you have character"".Dense script-writing, and what might seem like entirely irrelevant dialogue lets Pulp Fiction become its own piece. And rather than being driven by plot, the film is driven by its variety of surreal characters, who all talk in a way which seems so real. Yes, the conversations may not to be the same topic you talk about with another person, but the way in which a conversation branches off to an entirely different topic is something we all do in everyday life. Few films are able to portray dialogue through such a method, which is one of the countless reasons as to why Quentin Tarantino's script is the key instinctive foundation behind the film, since it lays the rules of what is to occur in a latter scene. The script crafts the comedy, as there are no comedic set-pieces in the film, nor is there a comedic narrative. However, the actors' delivery of nerve-biting, ego-driven lines, which brim with humour and emphasised body language, gives the film its distinguished tone of dark comedy. One of the reasons Pulp Fiction has become so iconic is due to its diversity in film-making, which is comprised of influences from French new-wave cinema, to Asian crime flicks, yet the film is still entirely original. Quentin Tarantino ultimately creates his own sense of ""bravo-film-making"". The use of tracking-shots, dolly-zooms, variation in lens focus, quick-cut editing, slow-motion sequences, lyrical camera positioning, steadicam tactics and close-up camera shots, the variety Pulp Fiction has is not just held within inside its narrative, but within its technical side too. Then you have the dynamic use of music, which has clearly been hand-picked by Quentin Tarantino himself and suits the film with a simplistic level of ease. The set-pieces are also crafted with scrutinising detail, such as the notorious lair, involving two hillbillies, a gimp and two of the film's protagonists.Pulp Fiction is, quite simply, a hard-boiled, noir-toned masterpiece of modern cinema, comprised of film-making which deserves to be dissected frame-by-frame. The sheer unadulterated consistency of greatness Pulp Fiction follows means it is a film which should be watched again and again. Yes, all the characters might be ""sinners"", yet there is no denying that you will be rooting for a certain character(s) by the end of the film, as surely, with characters as diverse as these there must be someone you share the same belief with, right? Devine-intervention is what Pulp Fiction is, a miracle and one which justifies vast acknowledgement. Take for example Jimmy's (Quentin Tarantino) brief conversation on the ""gourmet"" of coffee, it sums up the magnificence of Pulp Fiction perfectly, not forgetting the addition of ""lots of cream, lots of sugar"".","

"hhfarm-1","10 January 2006","This is worth seeing 1-2 times as it was fresh and innovative when it came out 10+ years ago. Tarantino certainly can write terrific dialogue. Walken, Roth and a couple of others are good. There are some beautiful scenes eg. the dance contest.By the time he got to Pulp Fiction, Tarantino had become self-conscious and, more important, had fooled himself into thinking that he had something deep to convey.Pulp Fiction is all hip and clever and fast and cool. It - any Tarantino movie really - laughs at movie conventions, characters, plots, story lines, scenes, and acting itself. In this he's following Burt Reynolds, who parodied his own roles and laughed at his own movies until he himself became a joke.When you watch Pulp Fiction you either buy into it or you don't. If you buy in, it's probably awesome (or at least better than the Kill Bill cr*p). But if you stand back a little bit it's just Hollywood behind an ultra-hip mask and like TV: slick & glossy but paper thin.After hearing much about this, we saw it not long after it came out. Easily the biggest disappointment ever in actual:hype ratio. This movie should rate 6/10 but is downgraded because of raised expectations.In complaining about it, a friend explained that to truly appreciate Pulp Fiction you had to understand that the briefcase contained Marsellus Wallace's soul, and that Jackson was an angel, and various other important insights.That's it then: as with any great movie, it just needed to be explained.","

"ivony","26 May 2003","There is just so much to say about this movie that I don't know where to start! I had no idea what I was ""in for"" when I went to see this movie.  I really hadn't seen the previews for it, and had read nothing about it at all. Usually, this is the best way for me to go into a movie...otherwise I have too many expectations.  Well, even if I *had* known something about Pulp, I don't think I would have expected what I got.  Not that I'm complaining.Pulp Fiction takes you on a roller coaster ride wherever Tarantino feels like taking you.  And what a thrilling ride it is!  From the opening scene we're left scratching our heads wondering exactly where Quentin is going to lead us on this one.  Is it another Natural Born Killers?  Another Reservoir Dogs?  Although there are nods to his other films, as well as several others, Pulp Fiction stands on its own.  From shocking to downright hysterical...this movie has it all.  Samuel Jackson is incredible (although I'm quite partial to him anyway) as the Bible quoting Jules.  John Travolta is tremendous as Vincent and is purely delightful to watch as the story unfolds.  The cast could not have been more perfect and Tarantino brings the best out in each and every one of the actors and actresses.Is there excessive use of the ""f word""?  Well, sure.  But c'mon!  We're talking about ""gangsters"" here (not to mention the 20th century)...for reality sake the ""f word"" really has become a part of everyday language for many people.  Aside from that, it *is* a Tarantino film and, well, he's not exactly known for being a prude.Glorifying violence and drug use...   Oh boy, don't even get me started. The LAST impression I got from this movie was some sort of message stating: ""it's ok to do drugs and kill people"".  Ummm, no.  Ok ok, so there may be teenagers who see this, you say.  Well then here we go on the ""it's the movies fault that there are problems..."" tangent.  I'm not even going into that one.  Bottom line regarding the drug use and violence:  if you are *that* impressionable, you probably shouldn't be watching anything beyond a G-rated Disney movie...and even that is questionable.All in all, Pulp Fiction was a fantastic film.  With its fabulous acting, perfectly cast crew, and hilarious moments, Pulp is one thrill after another.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to see it for what it is and can focus on the movie...not the bits and pieces taken waaaay out of context.  10 out of 10 stars.","

"ScottAmundsen","26 May 2011","It seems to be the fashion among film ""intelligentsia"" to give wild praise to the most incomprehensible and incoherent rubbish, sending the partly unspoken message that if you, the film-goer, do not get it, you are not smart enough to understand it. This applies to most of the oeuvre of the late Stanley Kubrick (with the exception of LOLITA, DR STRANGELOVE, and to a point A CLOCKWORK ORANGE), and it applies equally well to this odd and trashy bit of nonsense handed to us by Quentin Tarantino. To say that sitting through it was painful would be an understatement, but if that isn't bad enough, it is also incoherent and confusing (at one point the Samuel L Jackson character dies, if memory serves, only to show up alive later with no explanation given). Uma Thurman is striking to look at in that dark wig, and Travolta stretches what little acting talent he has, but I still to this day have no idea what the movie was about, and frankly, Tarantino failed to make me care very much.Like most of Kubrick's work, this film is visually striking: the color palette in particular is stunning. But at the end of the day, how a film looks means nothing unless there is some substance underneath the surface, and if there is any here, I did not see it.At the time this movie came out, the critics were falling all over themselves proclaiming that it represented a new direction for Hollywood films. Fortunately that seems not to have been the case.","

"pyrocitor","25 August 2006","When a previously unknown young filmmaker named Quentin Tarantino barged onto the movie-making scene in 1992 with a unique, quirky, disturbing and groundbreaking film called Reservoir Dogs, a noticeable change could already be seen soon after in the film industry on the whole. Cheap imitations of Tarantino's hit began to be seen, films with more stylized dialogue, harsher senses of humour usually coupled with brutal violence became much more commonplace and acceptable in the mainstream cinema. (a prime example being Tony Scott's 1993 hit ""True Romance"", also written by Tarantino) Yet if Reservoir Dogs was a hit, than Pulp Fiction was something entirely more, snatching up the prestigious Palme D'Or award at the Cannes film festival and making a huge smash impact on movie viewers and the film industry on the whole, spawning generations of cult followers and would be imitators. Despite the relentless praise Tarantino and his most prized film have been awarded, upon viewing over a decade later, Pulp Fiction still manages to intrigue and fascinate, with its blinding originality of narrative, and wonderfully convoluted screenplay. No matter how terrible or disgusting the myriad of characters on display here, we never fail to be utterly fascinated by them, and after the movie has run its two and half hour course, we are left only wanting more darkly comical and fiendishly interesting pulp tales to feast our eyes and ears upon. One also remarks on how deeply the movie has permeated modern pop culture simply by noticing all of the scenes that are referenced, whether it be by the Simpsons, Saturday Night Live or other movies, such scenes as the 50s dance scene with Travolta and Thurman,the ""you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in France?"" scene with Jackson and Travolta and Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames being bound and gagged by red rubber balls, only by seeing the movie will one truly understand how often it is referenced by so many sources. The movie truly defines the meaning of the term ""ensemble cast"" as well, with superb and incredibly memorable performances all around. John Travolta is great as spaced out, almost child like Vincent, who seems constantly on a different page as all surrounding him in the role that single-handedly re-ignited his career, and breakout star Samuel L. Jackson is similarly terrific as his partner with a tendency for religious rants, fully deserving their Oscar nominations. Tarantino favourite Uma Thurman is also terrific as a spoiled mobster's wife, and Bruce Willis gives an excellent, engaging performance as 40s style boxer Butch. Then there's the myriad of excellent supporting players, with such familiar faces as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Amanda Plummer, Tarantino himself... even a tiny cameo from an unrecognizable Steve Buscemi as Buddy Holly the waiter in the wonderful 50s dance club scene, and Christopher Walken delivering his utterly unforgettable monologue, one of the best and most memorable of all time. All in all, it goes without saying that Pulp Fiction is a modern classic of film-making, and despite all of the hype and endless praises, one still walks away from it remarking on how unique and wonderful a film it is. For those not deterred by the strong violence, frequent swearing and racial slurs that tend to be Tarantino trademarks, Pulp Fiction should qualify as a ""must see"", if only to understand all of the references in modern pop culture and see what everyone is talking about. Rest assured you will almost certainly not be disappointed. -10/10","

"Sirus_the_Virus","26 October 2009","John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and a ton of others star in one of the best films of all time, Pulp fiction. The movie is brilliantly made with a ton of action, laughs, and awesomeness. Tarentino hasn't done a better film in his career. That means something, because the guy hasn't had a bad film yet in his career. I couldn't agree with IMDb more. My favorite Tarentino movies are either this or Jackie Brown, which is very underrated. Both movies have a ton of plot, laughs, and action, and a great cast. Tarentino's films make you laugh even a parts that aren't supposed to be funny. Pulp fiction is a masterpiece.The film is a story of Vincent Vega and his friend Jules, two hit men. Vincent is asked by his boss to watch his wife(Played by Uma Thurman) for a night and gets her drugged up. Or she gets herself drugged up.Jules is thinking of retiring. The two guys get into some crazy situations. Another storyline in the film involves as boxer named Butch(Played by Bruce Willis) who is being hunted down by the Marsallis Wallace(played by Ving Rhames). That is who Vincent works for. The two of them get into some pretty crazy situations. Both of these tales are intertwined in a brilliant way. I forgot to mention another story plot. There is a couple(played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) who decide to rob a restaurant. A smart idea I think. All of these stories are intertwined in a brilliant fashion. This movie has some memorable scenes and quotes. Pulp fiction is a real classic and the comeback of John Travolta. All of the performances are great. In Be cool, they make many references to this movie. Perhaps not many, but a few. They really didn't have to. Because those who have seen this movie sure as hell aren't going to forget it.Pulp fiction:****/****","

"yiwanir","26 April 2020","I don't think I can describe in words the immense impact Pulp Fiction (and as a matter of fact, all of Tarantino's work) has had on me both as a person and a filmmaker. It's brilliant, it's exciting, it's fascinating and extraordinarily executed - it's everything a film should be. Watching Pulp Fiction just brings me true joy, in a way that no other film is able to - it fulfills the purpose of art, in my opinion, to the highest degree.","

"DaveDiggler","16 August 2008","""Pulp Fiction"" is considered Quentin Tarantino' masterpiece; both as a writer and director. Although it's not a perfect film and has a couple flaws, ""Pulp Fiction"" has one of the greatest scripts that changed the way films were made. The film opens with a conversation between ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny"" as they chat about their new plans to rob restaurants instead of banks and liquor stores. Eventually this scene will end the film as it doubles back on itself. Often times- and we're seeing the case more and more with Tarantino- he'll drive a film on dialogue instead of plot and substitute plot for senseless dialogue. That happens here, but it works most of the time. Lately it hasn't been working on the level of ""Pulp Fiction."" Uma Thurman plays Marcellus Wallace's (Ving Rhames) wife, Mia, and her only importance to film is to be entertained by Vincent Vega (John Travolta) on a date that's not quite a date. I feel as if these scenes are supposed to entertain us since it has nothing to do with the plot that is extremely thin compared to its run time (154 minutes). Travolta, for me, is the real stand out. When he's on screen his scenes, whether Jackson is next to him or not, are full of energy and pulp. He does a lot of listening, some dancing, a lot of arguing and/or debating, and offers up a lot of great comedic moments. His best scenes are with Uma Thurman when they go to Jackrabbit Slims. This little date, where they talk about nothing of much importance as far plot is concerned, is funny, engrossing and entertaining. I don't know why it never gets old, but it doesn't. The acting between the two is great and both were worthy of their Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. This section of the film is one of the strongest of the three along with ""The Bonnie Situation."" The writing and acting is superb in both sections. This date leads to an overdose as Mia takes a line of Vincent's heroine. The direction here is much in the mold of a graphic Hitchcock film. To add to the suspense the owner of the house counts to three (Something that happens quite a bit in the film). As he slowly counts to three we see all the nervously waiting faces in the entire room. We get a close-up shot on the needle that's cocked back and ready to strike. We get a close-up on the red dot where the needle needs to hit. It slowly builds the scene and the suspense. Tarantino handles this scene and all the others with a ton of precision and a lot of confidence. Tarantino makes huge strides as a director since his previous film, ""Reservoir Dogs,"" and a lot has to do with his confidence as a director. The older Tarantino is too confident in his abilities. The majority of ""Pulp Fiction"" has a lot of energy and snap to it. If you watch closely to the opening scene in ""Reservoir Dogs"" you won't see that same kind of crisp, confident direction from Tarantino. There are a lot of pauses throughout that conversation and it doesn't quite flow like a Tarantino film that we've become used to. To his credit he was working with some B-list (Some C or D-list) actors. He's not working with much more here, but the majority of his major role players are all acted out terrifically with the exception of one: Bruce Willis- through not fault of Tarantino; Bruce is just a bad actor. The section of the film that really drags, and is noticeably behind compared to the other two sections, is ""The Gold Watch"" section. This section is incapable of greatness since Bruce Willis single handedly ruins it with his ""Die Hard"" facial expressions, especially when they're not needed. The writing here is also the worst and, at times, puts the actors in very difficult situations. This section becomes annoying as we hear Bruce Willis call his girlfriend- that we won't care at all about- Lemon Pie, Sugar Pie, and retard. When he calls her a retard it's pretty funny, but other than that this lacks the punch that Travolta and Thurman provided minutes earlier. This section is bloated with dialogue, bad acting, and uninteresting characters. ""The Gold Watch"" has its moments and definitely picks up when we meet the gimp and the crazy world that we fall into. It just takes too long getting there. Christopher Walken provides a very interesting and hilarious story of the watch that has been passed down anally from generation to generation of the Coolidge family. ""The Bonnie Situation"" may very well be the strongest section of the film. This is where we meet ""The Wolf"" (Harvey Keitel) as he cleans up a mess made by Vincent Vega in a hilarious scene where he accidentally ""shot Marvin the face."" ""The Bonnie Situation"" offers up quite a bit of laughs, some great acting, and a very strong ending. The film ends where it started with Jules (Jackson) talking about changing his life around as he ""walks the earth."" Thankfully Gods interventionist-like hand, that saved him hours earlier, doesn't make him walk too far as He has sent him a weak person for the transitional Jules to save. The film ends on Jules changing or turning against everything he has ever done or known. Instead of being a bad - and killing ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth), he gives him some money, out of his own wallet, for a chance to start fresh and redeem himself. This might actually be ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny's"" last heist, and they have Jules to thank for the chance at redemption and changing their ways.","

"krorie","26 November 2005","Most movies, like most novels and musical compositions, have a beginning, a middle, and an end. But a gifted, creative director/writer such as Quentin Tarantino can convolute time and come out with a new kind of animal. And look what James Joyce and the stream of consciousness writers such as William Faulkner did with time in their works. Another great movie ""Momentum"" did it all backwards, starting at the end and ending at the beginning and it worked like magic. When I first rented ""Pulp Fiction"" when it was first released on VHS I watched it late at night and fell asleep right after the Jack Rabbit Slim sequence. When I awoke the story was back on the hit scene with Vincent and Jules still talking about quarter pounders and Big Macs. I thought the tape had rewound itself and so turned off the player. I didn't finish the movie until a few months later. Then I realized Tarantino was merely playing with time. In lesser hands ""Pulp Fiction"" would be too episodic, but Tarantino makes it all work. In the end we have a happy closing knowing that tragedy lies ahead because we have already seen that part in the middle.Vincent and Jules have to be the most garrulous hit men ever to appear in the cinema. They are debating the difference between oral sex and giving a lady a foot massage on their way to a kill. Jules, the spiritually misguided soul, continues to rattle on until eventually told to shut up when they arrive at the cleaners. With Tarantino at the controls all this seems to fit in when the final play is made. This element could have easily degenerated into prattle.Although there are many other levels of interpretation, I see this film as mainly a farce filled with dark humor and pathos, not just a farce on gangster movies in general but on our brave new world, centered on urban decay, corruption, exploitation, and perversion, filled with raw sex, drugs, and violence. The relationship between Butch and his woman points to another direction of love, compassion, and fulfillment. Note also that Butch goes back to help the man who was out to kill him because his morals wouldn't let him leave Marsellus to the rapists just as they wouldn't let him throw a fight. The watch is symbolic of eternal values that rise above the glitter and garishness of the ephemeral. Going back for the watch could have cost Butch his life but it and the values it represents were more important to him. In the end these values win out. Even Vincent has moments of compassion and tenderness, especially when with Mia. Jules almost goes full circle, but the viewer is left with a feeling that he is not totally sincere in his awakening following his brief encounter with death. Butch and his woman seem to be the only two who are able to get completely free from sin city.Each decade has movies that define the era. Think of ""Rebel Without A Cause"" for the 1950's or ""Casablanca"" for the 1940's. For me ""Pulp Fiction"" defines the 90's. All the things that were wrong for America are touched on by Tarantino, yet he provides the means of escape to what America should be. The world of the 90's was almost like a cheap book, or a book of pulp fiction as such a work was called once upon a time, showing the underbelly of urban life but with a way out. There is an exit. Sartre's ""No Exit"" doesn't work here. Redemption is possible, hopefully a more lasting redemption than the one Jules claims to have discovered. All he really has is a suitcase with contents that glitter when opened. Butch has the watch with eternal values.Tarantino wisely uses surf music from the 60's to highlight the gritty life of beach bums, now street bums, who think of themselves as warlords and urban supermen...but, hey, it's all pulp fiction in the end.","

"Q-Man","17 December 2004","I think that there is a herd mentality about this film. Because Tarantino cultists liked it, people say things like ""the best film of the 90's"". People seem to think that they are not cool unless they loved Pulp Fiction. Maybe I just don't get it, but what is so great about it? It's circular, big deal. The entire film is pointless, and I really don't care about any of the characters. The violence is gratuitous. I am not squeamish. I have watched, and, I have to admit, enjoyed Romero's ""dead"" films. It is supposedly funny when the kid gets shot in head and his brain is splattered all over the inside of the car. Yep, that is hilarious. The only good thing about the film is that John Travolta is in it.","

"verbal-15","2 August 1998","Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product.","

"moonspinner55","22 April 2007","Quentin Tarantino co-wrote, directed and co-stars in this flamboyant, literate, byzantine drama which is structured like a dime-store novel. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are Los Angeles hit-men, Uma Thurman is a gangster's girl whom Travolta is asked to entertain, Bruce Willis plays a boxer on the run after one of his fights ended in death. Critically-acclaimed picture caught fire with audiences as well, resulting in more show-biz success stories than any other film of the 1990's. Is it really that good? Yes, the verbal interplay and canny, cheeky handling is quite often exhilarating, and the performances by Travolta, Jackson and Willis (and Harvey Keitel as a low-keyed Mob kingpin) are near-perfection; however, the film's mixture of queasy, bloody violence (undermined by the jokey tone) and the barrage of foul-mouthed, low-life characters can easily become wearing. It won't be to everyone's taste, surely, but it's a visceral, gripping cinematic experience nevertheless, one with a knockout soundtrack and an Oscar-winning screenplay. *** from ****","

"georgios-christodoulou","2 November 2014","I was tempted to stop watching it about four times. I went up to the end just to see if, at least, there is something extraordinary or unexpected there. I really can't understand what all these viewers found to this film, to score it so high. It's the first time (or the second I'm not sure!) that I get into the mood of writing a review. The reason, I guess, is because this film is the fifth in the top 250 ranking and I couldn't see why. The curiosity of the ranking was also the reason of watching it at the first place. There is a high end casting and a top level director but nothing more, IN MY OPINION. I tried looking it through the eyes of 1994 but still compared to other productions of the age is far behind. If you find yourself in the position wondering whether to watch this film or not, due to its place in the list don't waste your time!","

"movieguy1021","2 December 2003","Controversy is usually good for movies. It's helped push movies to box office success just to see how bad they actually were, and I think that that is one of the ways Pulp Fiction has become so immensely popular. I've heard multiple people musing about the excessive violence, the drug use, the language, and more. So I really wanted to see Pulp Fiction beforehand, but curiosity piqued my interest. I have to say that all of the hype didn't really add anything. It wasn't very violent (or it could be that I'm just desensitized to violence, but besides one scene, I've seen worse on TV), the language just seemed to flow normally (or maybe it was because I had seen Bad Santa the day before and it had about the same concentration of language), and the drug usewell, I expected it for it is a movie about drug abusers.Pulp Fiction is less a complete movie than a series of interrelated stories, the most interesting of which is Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) as two gangsters who often have pointless conversations. Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is a boxer who accidentally kills his opponent in the ring and then he realizes the thrill of killing people. Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) pays Butch to throw that fight, but when he kills the guy, Marcellus gets Jules and Vincent to whack him. Along the way, Vincent has to take Marcellus's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out, and along the way she OD's. Got all that?There is one thing that Tarantino can do that no one else I've seen can do efficiently. He can work with time so well that you don't even notice it. Christopher Nolan first tried it in Following, unsuccessfully, and then executed well in Memento. However, there, he held our hand throw it, while Tarantino just lets it rip and hopes we can figure it out for ourselves, which we can do. That adds to the already thick layer of coolness that is in Pulp Fiction. Each character is memorable, especially Jules, who quotes from the Bible right before killing someone. It's just a very hip experience.Pulp Fiction cheerfully takes clichés, chews them up, and spits them out in a whole new vein. Like what Kill Bill did in the beginning, with the retro opening to set the mood, Pulp Fiction is halfway between an homage to gangster films and parody. Also, it's a trendsetter. The classic dance scene between Vincent and Mia at Jack Rabbit Slim's (which is a parody of all of those stupid throwback restaurants) has been parodied itself, as has the scene where Vincent and Jules are talking about McDonalds' Quarter Pounders.In addition to the layer of coolness, Pulp Fiction also has a lot of humor in it, much of it at times when you know you shouldn't laugh but you do, and also out of situations that you wouldn't laugh at usually. I'm sure some of the parts I laughed at were just because I wasn't expecting something to happen, or maybe I just have a morbid mind, but a lot of the humor came out of the violence.Everyone in the cast had amazing chemistry with each other, which added believability to a somewhat unbelievable story. The only reason that Pulp Fiction did not get a perfect score is that one scene with Butch and a cab driver went on for too long and did little to service the plot. Knowing me, though, I'll soon change the rating, but it can still be said that Pulp Fiction is one of the most influential movies of the 1990's.My rating: 9/10Rated R for strong graphic violence and drug use, pervasive strong language and some sexuality.","

"margineanvladdaniel","23 May 2022","I thought that the ""best"" of Tarantino's work is this one, considering the fans and the rate, but it was not far from the others. I expected a better violence cinematography, but was bellow Once upon a time. It was better and it was the only thing I liked about it: the storytelling, but that's it. Most of the plots were predictable. I think most of the fans loved Samuel's character journey, but for me wasn't enough and impressing, a bit dull even. He almost deserved that Oscar nomination, Quentin too, but Uma and John weren't worthy. Their screen time were too short and inconsistent to be that praising as everyone does. Hateful eight, still my favorite and best of all. Change my mind! Peace!","

"callanvass","8 January 2006","This is Tarantino's absolute best work and quite simply one of the best films ever! with brilliant storytelling and incredible performances. All the characters are wonderful and very memorable, and there are plenty of surprising and shocking moments throughout, plus Samuel L. Jackson,John Travolta,Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman are all simply amazing in this!. The dialog is extremely intelligent and witty, and I thought the whole foot massage story was really funny, plus The opening and ending are both especially awesome. I believe this film deserves to be #9 on the top 250! and my favorite segment has to be the watch with Butch Coolidge (Willis), plus Jackson and Travolta were so awesome together and had brilliant chemistry!. The music is fantastic, and Mia's (Thurman) OD'ing scene is both disturbing and somewhat funny at the same time, plus I thought the character development was outstanding. Ving Rhames is ultra cool in his role, and this is extremely well made and written as well! plus the scene where Mia and Vincent Vega are at the diner is just fascinating!.I remember watching this when I was about 13 or 14, and thinking it was so boring, god how could I have been so stupid!, this is truly what brilliant filmaking is all about, plus all the characters are extremely likable. I personally thought Quentin Tarantino was great in his scene and it is quite violent at times, plus one of my favorite scenes is when Vincent Vega's gun accidentally goes off in the car, as I found that to be a great bit of dark humor in my opinion. Harevy Keitel's scene is a memorable one was The Wolfe, and Uma's ketchup joke was funny, plus it all feels like a Dark comedy to me!. Travolta's joke about how they call the quarter pounder with cheese in Paris was very funny and Samuel L. Jackson had some brilliant lines as well! plus I loved Eric Stolt'z character as well. This is Tarantino's absolute best work, and quite simply one of the best films ever! with brilliant storytelling and incredible performances, and if you haven't seen it, what the hell are you waiting for? do so immediately you won't regret it trust me!.The Direction is masterful. Quentin Tarantino does a masterful job here, with fantastic camera work, awesome angles, and lots of other awesome shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace.The Acting is incredible!. Samuel L. Jackson is amazing here, he gives quite possibly his best performance, is hilarious, had brilliant chemistry with John Travolta, had some of the coolest lines of all time, really seemed to be enjoying himself, and just gave one of a kind performance, he was amazing (Jackson Rules!!!!). John Travolta is just as good, he rejuvenated his career, with his role here, and rightfully so. his scene with Uma Thurman in the diner, was especially awesome, he also looked damn cool. (Travolta Rules!!!!). Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is amazing here, he played one of his coolest characters, and it was basically an action role, but damn was it a good one!,Butch was my favorite character along with Jules!, he was just perfect for Butch (Willis Rules!!!!!!!). Uma Thurman also gives one of her best performances here, as the drug addicted Mia, she didn't have all that much screen time, but she made it memorable!(Thurman Rules!!!!!). Ving Rhames is excellent here as Marcellus, he was just a bad ass, and had a very cool scene with Willis!. Eric Stoltz cracked me up as Lance, he was one of the funniest characters in the film in my opinion. Christopher Walken had a cool cameo here and was great. Quentin Tarantino is actually really good as Jimmy and was quite funny. Harvey Keitel is awesome as the Wolfe as he cracked me up I loved him. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are both awesome as the robbers, and were just great. Rosanna Arquette(Jody) did what she had to do well. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall if you haven't seen it please do so immediately you won't regret it. ***** out of 5","

"springsunnywinter","27 November 2007","First of all my comment doesn't have spoilers because there is absolutely nothing to spoil. I intended to watch Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs after I seen Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 which I really liked because of the same director Quentin Tarantino. He became my favourite director after I seen Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 but no longer when I seen Pulp Fiction. It has all the possible bad things in a film and the list is endless. There is nothing but drug use and swearing that made my ears bleed, the F word was repeated more times than the number of heartbeats of a person's lifetime. None of the stories were appealing...in fact I just don't know what's going on because there was no structure or plot. The film was about 2.5 hours and I hated every second, it was Extremely boring that I had a sore head & I felt like ripping my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. Anyway I can go on forever.I just don't know why it's #5 on the IMDb top 250? Maybe because mostly people have accidentally clicked on 10 instead of 1 out of 10. Quentin Tarantino must have pulled the script from his bum and was running about in a circle with it then his wife must of hit him on the head with a rolling pin and said, ""You promised me no more rubbish films!"" He must of found a brain in a fruit bowl before he made Kill Bill he also looks like a idiot and talks like a girl. Now I don't intend to watch Reservoir Dogs. Crap Fiction is now definitely on my top 5 worst films of all time and is in second place. First is either Jackass the movie 1 or 2.It is critically acclaimed because 97% of critics have no brains and the rest of the 3% have cheated in their exams. That is why they always give good reviews to bad films and bad reviews to good films. Overall no matter what ever happens there will never be a worse film than Crap Fiction. Any movie in the IMDb bottom 100 is better and I would like to salute anyone who has given it a 1 out of 10. This whole comment is only 1% expression of hate to this stupid, crap, junk, garbage & good for nothing film.","

"=G=","11 December 2001","Color me stupid but I thought ""Pulp Fiction"" sucked. Being creative is easy when there are no rules...as in fantasies and cartoons and, well, pulp fiction. Creativity is not easy when the rules of reality are imposed. The reason why it took me several sessions over several  years to finally assimilate this boring piece of filmdom crap is simply because its silly story and peculiar characters are one dimensional sensationalistic nonsense which almost anyone could have created and I personally found them boring...not unlike Sunday morning cartoons. Of course that criticism flies in a face of incredible popularity by the public and critics alike not to mention an Oscar and countless other awards. Go figure. Bottom line, ""Pulp..."" -is- pulp fiction brought to the big screen with all the gratuitous filth and violence of a dime novel but without the one thing which could really have made it interesting. Why no T&A???","

I noticed Nolan used this same plot structure for 'Dunkirk' and it worked just fine after I watched it a couple of times. Perhaps Nolan was inspired by Tarantino's work? Dunkirk and Pulp Fiction are the only two films that I've seen so far that have used this method and its been executed so Professionally, Bravo to Tarantino and again like over 20 years later...","

But, the people who usually say this are pretentious film snobs and people who think this is something extraordinary. Excuse me, it isn't.First of all the film has NO plot. If a film has no plot, then why should we care about the unlikeable characters? Second, the diagloue is so....BAD. Does the director think people actually talk like this, because, well they don't.Third, the grossly, glamorous violence, is disgusting. This isn't a horror film, so why do we need such violence popping in and out of the movie? So, I urge everyone to avoid the hype of this pretentious, terrible mess.","

"malkane316","8 December 2004","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Possibly the most iconic film of the decade, and easily one of the best, Pulp Fiction is brimming with innovation, top class acting and jazzy dialogue. Tarantino weaves together a number of stories seamlessly, featuring gangsters and scumbags, violence and drugs, pop culture and art, and makes a perfectly coherent and enjoyable movie. The script is witty, the techniques he uses to tell the story are refreshing, The soundtrack is excellent, and used as part of the story, the dialogue is sharp but not cheesy or over the top, and the direction shows great skill and focus. Like The Godfather, and many other 'classic' films i have reviewed, there isn't much more i can say that hasn't been said before, except that this is the most recent film that has warranted that status. I still prefer Reservoir Dogs though. 9 out of 10","

"raymond_chandler","7 August 2001","The comments for ""Pulp Fiction"" generally fall into one of three categories: 1) ""Awesome Dude! The best movie ever!"" raves that offer zero supporting analysis, apparently written by Gen-Y homeboy wanna-bes raised on ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" sequels; 2) more considered, thoughtful raves praising the unconventional structure and 'hip' dialogue; 3) absolute horror that such violent, profane trash was ever made in the first place. I am much closer to #3 than the other two.
I had read about ""Reservoir Dogs"" (but not seen it) when ""Pulp"" was released. I went to see this with an open mind, before all the hype erupted. I almost walked out during the Gimp scene. I found this movie impossible to enjoy, because it seemed to revel in sadism, profanity, and cruelty, and I could find not one character to identify with. The whole film was simply unpleasant and repulsive - I just cannot find humor in graphic, casual murder. ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Seven"" are favorite films of mine, so I do not buy the 'go back to Mary Poppins' routine from many of the defenders of ""Pulp"". I think the audience (and possibly Tarantino himself) simply gets off on seeing people like this go about their business - it is a vicarious thrill. I have known some lowlifes in the real world, and it is most decidedly NOT fun. What genuinely scares me about the overwhelming praise that ""Pulp Fiction"" has received from critics and viewers is that there is zero empathy for the various victims of violence in this movie - they are regarded as mere props, not human beings.***SPOILERS*** One thing that has always bugged me, story-wise, is the scene in Butch's apartment with Vega. It makes no sense that a guy who is a professional killer would leave his weapon in plain sight, out of his reach, while he 'relieves himself'. I do not care how whacked out he is, in hostile territory he simply would never do that.***END SPOILERS***Everyone who praises Tarantino as the greatest filmmaker of a new generation - educate yourself a little about film. The overlapping storyline thing is nothing new (""Rashomon""), neither is using scatological monologues and non-stop profanity in place of actual dialogue (""Scarface"", for one). Let Tarantino write or direct something where the characters' primary means for self-expression is not gunfire, then we can talk.","

"possum-3","21 July 1999","I personally find this film to be a milepost on the decline of American society.This is a film in which paid murderers are our heros, who endear themselves to us with witty banter between their bloody exploits.  It features such entrancing scenes as countless murders, S&M rape, drug overdose, and other fun things to watch (it's a wonder Six Flags hasn't opened a thrill ride to capture the whole experience).  It features all manner of completely unredemptive characters doing cruel, inhuman, or brutal things to each other.  Is this entertainment?The last straw for me was when a young man was accidentally shot dead by our irascible heroes--  the big problem posed by this is 'how will we clean out the car?'  What can you say about someone who views human life so cheaply (hit men or no)?  What can you say about someone who finds such spectacle to be entertainment?The characters here are completely dehumanized, uncaring about the horrors they inflict on one another, and ironically, much of the audience must be equally dehumanized to accept these characters as the 'good guys.' If Tarantino is the genius this film led people to believe, that would have to be his point, wouldn't it--that to enjoy this movie you would have to be, in some way, sick?","

"kyle_c","2 September 2002","Interweaving three stories about small time gangsters, ""Pulp Fiction"" proved to be one of the most interesting, original, and entertaining films of the last fifteen years.  Using Tarantino's characteristic dialogue, in which the characters speak about everyday things rather than just the plot, the movie creates a light atmosphere, counterpointed by moments of extreme violence and intensity.  An infusion of many classic genres, such as noir, it manages to put a new spin on many old cliches.  A must see for any  appreciator of cinema.","

Pulp fiction is a highly entertaining movie filled with extra ordinary performances, talented actors and a very intelligent script. That's not to say that it is not an artistic cinema, today, the movie stands as one of the greatest movie ever made. With non linear narrative, powerful performances, excellent score and memorable dialogues which will stay with u forever, pulp fiction qualifies the rigorous beauty that is cinema..","

"cfcpg","18 November 2005","Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it. The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min!","

Quentin Tarantino found a way to wrap the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's into this film seamlessly and beautifully. Just an awesome movie with a great script and unexpected humor throughout. The movie is cool and it makes you want to be cool too. One thing I have noticed about Tarantino is that his movies are very cool. They make you feel like you're back in the 70's when it was OK to smoke cool. They make you feel like wearing sunglasses in doors cool.The cast was awesome. Every cast member played their role beautifully. Samuel Jackson was awesome! It was so hilarious how he ate that guy's cheese burger then drank his entire drink in the beginning of the movie before shooting him. That scene was just epic. Every scene was epic.","

It's like, let's get a couple of guns, a couple of f-words, a couple of murders and let's combine them to make a movie.  I hated everything about it.  EVERYTHING.  To me, all the positive comments on this site about this movie are written by only 1 fan under different usernames.  So the scenes were not in chronological order, big deal.  That doesn't make it a masterpiece.  This is hollywood garbage. There are some scenes that are sick.  The movie is SICK.  This is my review. I gave it a 2/10 just because the actors are respected.

"Eternality","12 July 2010","What else is there to say about Pulp Fiction that has not been said? I am tempted to stop writing here but a one-liner review is never going to do justice to Quentin Tarantino's cinematic masterpiece. So, if you will, let me ramble.After the breakthrough at Sundance that was Reservoir Dogs (1992), one would be hard-pressed to find a film-making talent as precocious as Tarantino at that time. Here was a man who, before he started making films, worked in a video store. Such was his fascination for movies that he began to write stories while at work, obviously influenced by the culture he was immersed in.What happened afterwards was the stuff of legend. His ""stories"" became Reservoir Dogs, and two years later, he made the Palme d'Or winning Pulp Fiction at age 31. To my knowledge, the only American filmmaker I could think of who won the coveted Cannes award at a younger age was Steven Soderbergh for Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989) at 26.The fear of making an explosive debut like Reservoir Dogs is that it is tricky to score again. With Pulp Fiction, Tarantino not only scores but has created the perfect goal for himself. Easily one of the top ten films of the nineties, Pulp Fiction is a lengthy film that weaves four stories together in a non-linear narrative structure that continues to impress with each viewing.The four stories are as follows: One, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are two mob hit men who work for Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), a ruthless gangster boss, and are assigned to retrieve an important suitcase. Two, Vincent is tasked by Marcellus to take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for the night leading to an unexpected circumstance. Three, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), a boxer, betrays Marcellus by not losing his match, and runs away with his betting money instead. Four, two small-time robbers are dining in a restaurant when they decide to spontaneously rob its patrons.One way or the other, the four tales are linked to each other. Expertly crafted by Tarantino (who won an Oscar for original screenplay together with co-writer Roger Avary), Pulp Fiction pushes the envelope for cinema writing, influencing a new generation of filmmakers such as Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Amores Perros, 2000; 21 Grams, 2003). While it takes some time to understand what Tarantino is trying to do, there is never a moment of confusion in his storytelling.The performances in the film are outstanding, and are made even more memorable by the brilliant interchange of dialogue among the characters. The signature Tarantino verbal banter is laced with witty remarks and nonsensical debate over irrelevant issues from foot massages to quarter-pounder burgers. Tarantino picks at the itsy-bitsy of American popular culture and brings his stylish brand of film-making to the forefront of that very culture he is trying to redefine.Pulp Fiction's lasting legacy lies not only in its imitable screenplay (there are so many quotable lines), but how it revitalizes a tired genre – the gangster crime-thriller – to suit contemporary tastes. As much as the film is about violence, drugs and sexual fetishes in suburban America, it is also a powerful tale of redemption, most notably encapsulated by a thought-provoking monologue by Jules in the final act, which in itself, is a stunning closure to its prologue.SCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!","

"thespeos","27 June 2021","What is wrong with reviewers? Really. Have we devolved into less-than apes?How and why does anyone rate this so highly, with an average of 8.9?People (men), (white men), are obsessed with playing the ""gangsta,"" drugs, sex, and using the f*bomb.This is good film??? Tarantino has been and continues to be a narcissist, and all of his fan boys like to tag along.As much as I hate the ilk of Tarantino, his film-making skills are of high value, so all is not lost - technically.STORY:
This ""story"" is a patchwork of stories, like what Tarantino does with his other films. Arguably the central story is
about two (2) hit men, but they are more like thread than fabric. The ""story"" isn't really a story with any kind of
valuable message (contrary to the fan boys); no, it's more like the ""days in the lives of people living in darkness.""The story has no intrinsic purpose or value - it's just white men wanting to (vicariously) play the ""gangsta.""ACTING:
This film has one (1) highlight - good acting. There is no character development (the director lacks this skill),
but the acting is clean, crisp, and the cast remain in character throughout.TEMPO:
The pace is somewhat appropriate for its genre (whatever that is), but it too often bogs down in itself (yes, like
the mythical Narcissus gets lost in his own self-affections).CINEMATOGRAPHY:
This is a reasonably well-scened film, but again, more like a ""day-in-the-life-of,"" so nothing special.DIRECTING:
Excellent skills, but I loathe the director.Overall, if you like watching people kill, torture, curse, use illicit drugs, and you really want to be a ""gangsta,""
then by all means ... watch this.","

"lars_hendrikx","7 June 2012","This movie is definitely my favorite movie.Like every movie of Quentin Tarantino i've seen, the dialogues in this movie are of great quality. Two mobsters discussing the wonders of Amsterdam and its weed or the name of a cheeseburger in Paris makes them seem like normal people. I especially liked the discussion between Vincent and Pitt about massaging feet.What I found admirable is that a simple feature as a toilet plays a part in this movie. When Vincent and Pitt take care of Brad and his friends who messed up a deal with Marsellus Wallace their last accomplice hides in toilet. When Vincent goes to the toilet at Mia's after their date(or wasn't it a date?) Mia mistakes his heroine for cocaine and overdoses. When Vincent is done at the toilet he finds her. When Vincent goes to the toilet at the restaurant and the restaurant gets robbed.Overall, I love this movie and I think it absolutely deserves its spot among the best movies out there. Superb acting, good plot line, a must see.","

"WubsTheFadger","14 May 2018","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerPulp Fiction is a film that must be seen. The story is cleverly put together and elegantly flows from character to character. The story is funny, brutal, disturbing, and memorable. The story is told in a nonlinear fashion and requires the audience to pay attention. Tarantino has created some of the most complex characters in cinema. They all have personality and are relatable in various ways. The dialogue between the characters is amazing. The ending is stunning.The acting is very good. Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Amanda Plummer, and Ving Rhames all perform extremely well. They all give their characters a certain flair and keep the story going with their individuality.The pacing is perfect and the runtime is justified because Tarantino builds his story and characters slowly.The amount of cursing in this film is, in my opinion, unneeded. I found the extent of the swearing excessive. The use of violence is perfect though.Pros: Elegantly told story full of memorable moments, a lot of funny moments, amazing characters, great dialogue, amazing acting, perfect pacing, and a good use of violenceCons: Excessive cursing and the runtime can be long for someOverall Rating: 9.1P.S. Pulp Fiction is a classic that should be experienced by all movie watchers. I would recommend being over the age of 18 because there are a lot of sexual situations and dialogue.","

But films such as this that have long-running dialogs - some sensible but mostly far-fetched, need to have a solid plot to be interesting. The plot of ""Pulp Fiction"" is very weak - almost pointless. And when the long stretches of cinematic street philosophy are punctuated with brutal scenes of blood and guts, I don't find much of anything entertaining.I enjoy great mysteries, including some of the better film noir. But for the gore and guts movies to be good and have appeal, they must at least have an interesting plot and very good screenplay. ""Reservoir Dogs"" was such a Tarantino movie. But this plot has scenarios that bounce around in a weak screenplay. While there's a thin thread that connects some parts, others don't mesh. So, it comes across as a few short stories put together, some of which have the same characters.An example of this is when Christopher Walken's Captain Koons tells a tall story to a young boy named Butch Coolidge. Two scenarios or so later, Butch is a full-grown boxer played by Bruce Willis. Other scenarios happen out of order, or in reverse order. This seems to be a style with Tarantino, and one that some movie critics and buffs think is a great talent. I think it's a technique meant to grab an audience where the writer can't figure out a way to do it with a straight story chronologically.This sort of sets on end the long-standing teaching and methods of storytelling, writing, and playwrighting. And, there are a number of people who still prefer the chronological order of stories. We don't mind the use of flashbacks which are clearly identified as such. But wide changes in time or order, back and forth, from one scenario to another is confusing and says the author couldn't come up with the right ending. So, he or she used some weird techniques to make an ending superfluous. And, some of these films really don't have endings.This film could have started or ended just about anyplace within the screenplay. Tarantino or the director just needed to shuffle the pages. It ruins what might be a good story for me. As for the acting in this film - what's so outstanding about characters spewing vulgarities back and forth, or screaming and intimidating people with foul threats in running expletives? Seems we all have a tantrum streak within us.""Pulp Fiction"" isn't an enjoyable or entertaining film. It is a look at the underworld of drugs, thugs, blood and guts. The only thing I can see that might attract such near adulation for this film is the huge and diverse cast. But I'll take any number of other types of films that can entertain with solid plots, screenplays with civility, and great acting.","

"KubricksRube","9 April 2002","Is it possible that something so loathsome and awful could actually be adored and lauded by millions of people?  Is it only a matter of chance that some movies are loved and others hated, regardless of their content?  I hope this is true, because I cannot believe that there is actually anything good about the movie Pulp Fiction to lead any sane, reasoned, drug-free person to write the glowing comments that surround mine, much less the oodles of people who actually handed over their money to see this thing.Why is this movie so bad, you ask?  Okay, I'll tell you, even though it's like pointing out why windows are transparent.  Starting with the script, I see no reason to be impressed by an assemblage of overly stylistic dialogue and flat, boring characters.  There is nothing amazing about two guys talking about French McDonald's restaurants, and then killing some guys. Every awful stretch of dialogue is dragged out as long as it will last, and then some.  It's as if Tarantino said to himself ""I think I can cram one more line about milkshakes in here"".  You have to give him credit for padding the film in ways that nobody's ever tried before.  The actors look as though they're doing their best to salvage this turkey (and they are talented), all the while knowing in the back of their minds how much of a cow pie the whole thing is.  As far as Tarantino's directorial style is concerned, he should just get himself a career in Nike commercials because that's where his talent level cuts off.","

"Ian-67","7 January 1999","Ok, no review now because we all saw this awesome movie. The best is not the actors (despite the great Samuel L. Jackson), is I guess, the wonderful script about that kind of things that we usually in our minds we have, but that we never get out from our mouth.I mean, the silence when we talk with another, the things we know about erotism and sexuality but never talk about it, that moral and ethic we have, but never use, etc...At the end, we only may say that Tarantino do everything he could, and now, 4 years later, we may say, that this is a film for all eras, because that kind of speech is the kind we live every day, in all walks of life. Do not judge the bad words, or the places around, look for the speech... that's the real thing.","

"Vegie","4 January 1999","""Pulp Fiction"" has two things going for it; Sam Jackson(robbed at the Oscars) and Christopher Walken(who has the film's funniest sequence. But that's all. The Tim Roth/Amanda Plummer scenes are irritating and too profane(swearing's great, but not like this). The Bruce Willis ""Gimp"" scene is memorable but a little sicko, and The Uma Thurman sequence(you know the one) is absolutely unbearable. She and Travolta(too fat to dance and never a terrific actor) almost ruin this 1994 Tarantino film single handedly. But no, it is Tarantino himself that ruins the film; everyone is nasty, it's excessive, the way the three stories are told is confusing, and...that's about it. Some of it is funny, and Ving Rhames is good as Marsellus Wallace, but this is too much for me. I know many like Tarantino, but I think he's a show-off in the grand tradition of John Woo(one of his heroes apparently).","

"kurciasbezdalas","15 October 2008","Right now I can't find right words to describe this movie. I used to think that Jackie Brown is a best Quentin Tarantino's film but this movie has a much deeper meaning than Jackie Brown. You have to watch really intently to understand it. I realized how clever this movie is by watching the last scene. There is a lot of interesting dialogs which may appear pointless but they are not. There is a lot of memorable moments and interesting characters. The soundtrack is great. This movie was considered to be very violent but actually there wasn't much violence (in one episode of Oz you can see more violence than in this film). This movie is really worth your time.","

"the_mad_mckenna","18 August 2002","I first saw Pulp Fiction on a bootlegged copy on VHS while it was still in theatres, which was funny due to the fact it still had the segment where Mia Wallace ""interviews"" Vincent before their date on a video camera. How surprised I was to see it in a theatre and see the scene missing. Quentin tacked it onto ""collector's edition"" VHS copies later on.The reason I watched it on video first was that I was sure I'd hate it; instead, it's unique, funny, touching, profane, cringy (hello, zed!) and flat out a great ride all the way. This movie is Also Bruce Willis' BEST performance by far. Most people talk about Travolta who is wonderful, but Willis pulling off a truly sympathetic and likable character is amazing. Sam Jackson also pulls off a career best performance - not everyone could deliver those lines from the Bible and make them sound as menacing and convincing.","

"ccthemovieman-1","23 March 2006","From what I gather, and my own reaction, people either love this movie or hate it. Strangely, I have been on both sides of the fence with this film. I never look at it in the same light, for some reason. At first I hated it and on a second chance, really liked it. Then the same two things happened on the third and fourth viewings until I finally stopped.This is an extremely profane film laced with a lot of dark humor. I have a machine that can filter out much of the profanity and I often appreciate dark humor, but blowing a guy's brains out in the back seat of a car is funny? What am I missing?Two things I will say: the film doesn't lose me despite being two-and-a-half hours. There are no boring lulls and the dialog is fascinating in parts, mainly between John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Their discussions are unique, to say the least, and one certainly remembers Uma Thurman's role and Travolta slamming a syringe into her chest. With 240 f-words and the Lord's name in vain 28 times, I miss a lot of sentences with the filter. It's still an interesting film.....in a perverse way. The other thing: yes, there is some dark comedy in here but overall this should NOT be labeled a comedy, or God help us all.","

Now this movie is definitely really unique, and for that reason it gets a 7, I don't think I'd ever seen something like pulp fiction done before pulp fiction and it almost feels like the typa movie ud see christopher nolan make.The script itself is fine I guess. It's nothing special. Samuel L Jackson hard carries. Out of the whole movie only him and the wolf felt like they were enjoyable characters. In my opinion John Travolta was last generations timothee chalamet, someone who gets a lot of love but isn't that great an actor and a lot of his line deliveries aren't great. Overall pretty overrated 7.8/10.","

Bringing some of the greatest actors together: Urma Thurman, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken & Ving Rhames. Having solid actors really pushes the films to it's greatest limits.For some minor things, including the retarded rape scene with the cop and I wish Urma & Smauel L. Jackson should be in the film a bit more. i'll go through all the positive things about the film.Dialogue, 10/10: The dialogue was hilarious and at times very powerful and the swearing was over the top which I loved.Storyline, 9/10: The plot was very stylish and very easy to catch all the time and I like the flash moment back at the start. SO I think that deserves tremendous credit.Acting, 10/10: Do i need to say anymore, it was freakin fantastic.Scenes, 10/10: Everything about this film is really great and all the scenes (except for the rape scene) excellent and well executed. Most of the time I found the scenes really funny and for good reason, for e.g. I found the $5 milk shake or the story of a watch, lol. Even the action is compelling.Everything is well stable in this film and I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't watched this yet. I'm so glad I watched this film NOW!!!!.I give it an easy 10/10","

The cinematography is a masterpiece. Tarantino's style makes the audience feel like they're in the movie by the camera movements, and the way the story is told, is also one out of the many unique things about the film. The first time I've seen it, I was so confused on how the story was basically out of order but the more times I watched it, the more I caught onto Tarantino's style and the more I appreciated it. This movie was ahead of its time, and in my opinion considered a masterpiece.","

I, for one, fail to see how this movie resurrected the career of John Travolta as his performance was just totally unbelievable. Focusing on what appears to be several unrelated life experiences, Tarrantino once again utilizes his penchant for violence, drug addiction, rape, and other assorted seedy topics. The plot (if you want to call it that) is non-existent and the scene involving Ving Rhaimes is just flat-out disgusting. For Tarrantino fans, this may be the ultimate. But for me, it's just not a good film.","

This film in my opinion without a doubt qualifies as one of the best films ever made, and definitely one of the most entertaining also. Acting from everyone is great, but you can't beat Jackson's ""And you'll know my name is the lord when I lay my vengeance upon thy."". This film is an entertaining film that is sure to please those who want to watch it, and many of those who don't.4 stars out of 4","

"drystyx","11 April 2006","Pulp Fiction is mildly amusing in parts, and in all honesty relies completely on the scene that makes the movie, from where Bruce Willis walks past the clothesline to where he makes up with the hilarious crime boss. Much like the log scene makes a King Kong movie. The scenes with Willis are livelier than the scenes with the two dull, obnoxious hit men who get way too much screen time, and put the viewer to sleep. The surface plot of this movie is pretty dull, and it's tough to care with the poorly written characters, but it relies on its ""iconic"" style of trash talk and actions. The hidden plot of this movie is the title itself of ""Pulp Fiction"". This movie has mixed allusions to different eras. Sometimes, it is the late eighties and early nineties, but more often it is the late sixties, early seventies, with the rotary phones, clothes lines, rarity of billboards, and the songs people tapped fingers to in those days. What we have is essentially a make believe world in which kids from the seventies think the world is like outside, where everyone carries a gun and is either a boxer, gangster, killer, or lunatic. The ""modern"" images are all imagined by the seventies kids thinking they'll be in such a world when they grow up. A decent idea, but it could have been done better with more interesting hit men. The Bruce Willis character, and his performance, help salvage this, though.","

"Leofwine_draca","18 October 2016","Quentin Tarantino's gallery of grotesques is definitely a strange film to watch. Breaking many of the modern rules of a film - there are four interlocking stories instead of one, the subject matters tackled are extremely adult and may not be to everybody's taste - it's a wonder that the film succeeds, but in the end PULP FICTION has to be one of the best films of the 1990s. As much as we would like to ignore it, this is what the world is like today, full of drugs, violence and hostility, and it's about time a film faced up to the real world. PULP FICTION does just this.I liked three of the stories, but the one involving Travolta and Thurman left me cold I'm afraid. For a start, it's far too long and needlessly talky (about nothing in particular), and could have been cut down a lot. It seems to take ages to get to the actual horror of the piece (Thurman's drug overdose and subsequent heart injection), and when that moment comes, it's over extremely quickly. There is no particularly memorable dialogue here, either.The surrounding story, where the couple hold up a restaurant, is perfectly set up, and the final moments, where Jackson holds up the robbers himself, does show some of Tarantino's genius as Jackson quietly discusses the situation with his would-be robbers in a matter-of-fact way. The story of Travolta and Jackson trying to clear up their 'mess' is an excellent piece of black comedy, well-timed and with a scene-stealing performance from Harvey Keitel as the Wolf. Bruce Willis' story is very good too, with some unexpected twists in the tale and some harrowing scenes.There's a catchy jukebox score and an ensemble cast to liven things up too. The cast list is a reading of '90s talent: John Travolta in his comeback film; Samuel L Jackson was relatively unheard-of then; Uma Thurman proved herself as a woman to be reckoned with; Bruce Willis lent another world-weary performance to his CV, and none the worse for it; Ving Rhames also proved himself as an up-and-coming actor; Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer were cool and hysterical in equal measures; Harvey Keitel stole the show as clear-up man; Quentin Tarantino put in a twitchy cameo appearance which wasn't as nearly as bad as everybody said; Eric Stoltz was memorable as a stoned drug addict...the list is endless, really. There are other names I miss out in the interests of space.While Tarantino's rapid-fire dialogue is as sharp as ever (his decision to have the hit men talk about normal, everyday things like Quarter Pounders and Big Macs instead of ""gangster stuff"" was very clever), it is the succession of odd images which really stay in the mind, such as Travolta accidentally blowing apart someone's head; Willis and Rhames fighting, escaping into a spare-part shop and getting attacked; Thurman's adrenaline injection and the hysteria surrounding it; and finally Roth and Plummer getting the tables turned on them. All of these moments help to make PULP FICTION an endearing slice of cinema, which I'm sure will be remembered as a minor classic in years to come.","

The movie is so good and just interesting he has like four stories and ends up connecting every single one. The movie is super intense at parts and then really funny at others. The part where Sam L. Jackson takes that guys big kahuna burger and is questioning him is so tense since you know he isn't making it out alive. Also one my hands down favorite parts in a movie ever is when John Travolta's gun goes off in the car and he's just like ah man I just shot Marvin in the face like it was just a little slip up. The guys head exploded h=in his car! Anyway incredible movie definitely watch.Also if you didn't know there is a theory that was confirmed by Terintino That all his films are connected.","

"anthonywltrs","24 September 2022","Throughout the years I often heard how Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece and one of the greatest movies of all time. It wasn't until today I finally had taken the time to sit down and watch this for the first time from start to finish to see what all the fuss is about. Needless to say, this is a very mixed bag for meWhat I like about Pulp Fiction is the plot being all jumbled up and not straight forward like many other movies where you see how everything begins and ends. Pulp Fiction doesnt do that. It's back to front so to speak starting at the end but going backwards. It feels disconnected and out of place as it tells different stories but they are actually are all connected in a wayI also liked the deep themes and talks of existentialism, nihilism and philosophical talks of God with some of the characters. It also helped the movie had a great star studded cast to give Pulp Fiction and extra umph to itWhat I dont like is the subplot for Burce Willis's character that involved him and a mob boss being tied up and were about to be raped by two guys with the mob boss getting raped. I hate rape and I hate how it's used in media. It's just awful and always feel sick about it. If I had known rape was a factor in Pulp Fiction I would not have bothered at all. Thankfully though the rapists get what's coming to them in the endI also didnt like how some scenes and dialogue with the characters fell flat where nothing really happens and it just drags on and on. I actually didnt start to like or get interested until Bruce Willis is in a shootout with the mob boss character but then the rape part comes ugh.Overall this movie was decent and I have no regrets in taking the time to watch this for my Sunday morning. It's definitely not a movie I'd be considered in watching again, once is enough for me and not to add to my ever growing DVD collection.","

"daddyofduke","24 January 2012","There isn't a single normal person in Pulp Fiction. Not a one. And that is what makes the film so memorable. There a ton of things going on, including a bizarre couple robbing a diner, a couple of hit men avenging a rip off of a mobster boss, a boxer who is supposed to take a dive but doesn't, and a mobster's wife being entertained by one of the hit men.I admit it. I saw Pulp Fiction for the first time a couple of nights ago. Why it took me 17 years to see this very special movie is known only to God. To think I could have spent all these years seeing this movie countless times, like I do The Godfather, Casino, GoodFellas, and Love Actually is a bit disappointing. But at least I've seen it now, and now I understand what all the fuss has been all these years.John Travolta made his comeback with his performance as one of the loopy hit men, and deservedly so. He is off kilter enough to be interesting but not so extreme as to be insane. He just kills in his worldly sort of way. Samuel L. Jackson, a killer who obsesses about sin and absolution, is his partner. Uma Thurman is the mobster's wife who Travolta's character is supposed to entertain. Take a look at Steve Buscemi as their waiter. Directed brilliantly by Quentin Tarantino, all of the performances are memorable. The list of stars who shine in this movie are as endless as the subplots that they play in; Ms. Thurman, Messers Travolta and Jackson, Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, and Harvey Keitel. Keitel's ability to play twisted in such a straight sort of way is astonishing.The dialog in this film is classic, as I was warned it would be. I was enthralled with the well crafted dialog that comes out of the actors so seemingly effortlessly, and with such entertaining effect.Everyone who sees this film will interpret its meaning differently, especially the ending. As for me, I will never use the bathroom when I am supposed to be knocking off a double crossing boxer.And remember, ""Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character.""","

"gavin6942","18 June 2008","Quentin Tarantino presents his masterpiece: interwoven tales of a washed-up boxer, some bodyguards to powerful crime kingpin, and others who cross their path on this fateful day. Featuring an all-star cast: John Travolta in his best role (relaunching his dead career), Sam Jackson in his defining role (still trying to outdo himself fourteen years later), Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth and more. (Many of these being Tarantino regulars, who work well with his idiosyncratic style.) How do I review a film so many people have praised, including my hero Roger Ebert? I could be a detractor and say its a bad film, but I'd be lying. I love the story and how it all plays out. I still prefer Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"", but this comes in a close second. (Sadly, I don't think he ever recovered after he became famous. Subsequent films -- ""Jackie Brown"", ""Kill Bill"" and ""Death Proof"" -- all have a certain charm to them, but are not close to being on the level of ""Dogs"" or ""Pulp"".) Although I've seen this movie, or at least bits of it, a dozen times, I think the most recent may be the most interesting. I watched it with a young woman who saw Bruce Willis and asked who he was. I said, ""Bruce Willis."" She asked who that was. I listed a few of his bigger films (""Die Hard"", ""Armageddon"", etc.) but she said she had not seen them. How a woman in her 20s does not know Bruce Willis or any of his movies is beyond me, but it got me wondering: would ""Pulp Fiction"" be a different film if I didn't recognize the majority of the actors? Walken, for example, appeals to me because he's Walken. Would his monologue be as good if delivered by someone else or by Walken when I didn't know him by name? Curious thought.If you haven't seen ""Pulp Fiction"", see it. Tarantino is a better writer than a director, but this film offers probably his best directing to date and some superb writing. He is very dialogue-intensive, which I think alienates some viewers (particularly in ""Death Proof""), but give him a fair shake. This film defined the 1990s and continues to be influential in film today. Pay attention and you'll be sure to see why.","

"TedMichaelMor","1 July 2010","""Pulp Fiction"" is a remarkable movie. Watching it multiple times, I take pleasure in its mischievous exploitation of tropes as well as many other playful traits. I enjoyed calling it a great Lutheran movie—as I did for many years. There is a theological core to the narrative.The sister of a former friend deeply disparaged this movie to me. She felt it is pretentious with a celebration of decadence. I think she overreacted.The grace of the film emerges in expression of the clear love of cinema embodied here. I feel indebted to Quentin Tarantino for writing, directing, and acting. I deeply admire the superb and enchanting cinematography by Andrzej Sekuła. The work of co-writer Robert Avary is clearly vital. Sally Menke's insightful and gracious editing might be the most important component though here everything works.This film deserved careful viewing and critical analysis. The cast is one of the best ever assembled for any film. There is no false note anywhere in casting. I particularly enjoy watching ""Ving"" Rhames though pointing out any actor over another here seem unfair. The same goes for favoring any sequence in the movie, but I do love ""the Bonnie situation"".Those who finally financed this masterwork showed great artistic sense. We are in their debt. In particular, one somehow knows that Quentin Tarantino is the single most important genius behind this work. His touch is everywhere. The dialogue stays with one long after initial viewing.","

Average movie that talks a lot and is set in mainly one place. Pulp Fiction is another movie that talks a lot, and doesn't do much else. It is a 2 in a half hour long movie and calls itself a action gangster movie. There is hardly any violence in this movie, its just talking talking and more talking. No where near comparable then Goodfellas, Scarface, Godfather or Casino. Only a few jokes like Bruce Willas and Ving Rhames in their worst nightmare. This is more of a comedy gangster related movie like Lock Stock and two smoking barrels. That was funny.","

"Trey_BigTime_Film_Critic","4 January 2021","Let me however extrapolate, embedded in a Pulp Fiction review which I couldn't care less for - on my film review style - from someone who has a media degree in film studies, and began their career wagging school at fourteen to watch French Cinema; and you know what they say about people who have experiences at an impressionable age - it sticks! I gave up on Hollywood in approximately the early seventies after Easy Rider and Zabriskie Point. I even walked out on Five Easy Pieces, even though in retrospect, that wasn't the film's fault, in those days we were keen on life and not on introspection and reflection. Though retrospection, tells me that was a good film. In fact it is the kind of film that the baby boomers now crave, good writing, and good characterisation from a period in history when just being alive was an entertainment, and not bogged down with crazy little computer screens and cowards with their wise-arse messages tweeted because they are too afraid to speak, possibly because even the modulation of the voice has been colonised by trendoids, who are so post-modern and wise-arsed they know everything; but at the head of the pack are a bunch of no-talents who have clamoured to the high ground. And that list is endless in entertainment, now: Quentin Tarantino (highlight-dialogue in Pulp Fiction, ""In Holland, they have mayonnaise on their fries."" - conclusion - lame) Johnny Depp (the guy can't act, get it? That's why Australians get Oscars now, as Hollywood is beyond knowing, who can act]; Russell Crowe (just because Hollywood couldn't get anyone else to fill out a Roman general's tunic except maybe some wooden ex-wrestlers), he wins the Oscar-but in his next movie, A Beautiful Mind, everyone gets an Oscar except him, because basically, when you play a screw-loose professor, exchanging walking around in circles for walking around in squares, it is not acting! It is a guy walking around in squares cos he worked out that was a riff on walking around in circles]; Saving Private Ryan, though I hate to admit it is a brilliant film - through its depiction of my grandfather's generation, who when I was growing thought wasn't cool; but mine who made every piece of furniture in their house to a French polished standard; as well as, the P.A. system for my Uncle's successful band including the foldback cabinets-which even The Beatles didn't have-as well as keeping a 200 acre dairy farm as a hobby. Cool, I don't think I knew the meaning of the word; but the Juden angle in Saving Private Ryan which is shoved towards the POWs by a man brandishing - a Star of David (on his dog-tags?)-as the POWs march past-I'm not buying because usually and in that war in particular - it is the politicians, the military hierarchy and their bureaucratic underlings who systematically entrench racism as a tool of their propaganda and the common soldier is generally ideologically neuter as they have to follow orders or get shot - otherwise on the western front in 1915 both sides would have turned around and marched home. But that was the only glaring error in my opinion but this ethno-stereotyping, though understandable has spilled into his other films, especially the Star Wars epics, wherein Cowboys and Indians in Outer Space in the early films becomes metaphoric American foreign policy in latter films... to be continued...","

"akdjreview","25 December 2021","After hearing so many great things about pulp fiction I was intrigued. A story consisting of a bunch of smaller stories that interweave is an interesting concept. And Quentin Tarantino absolutely doesn't fail to make it great.The story is driven by multiple but few characters characters that all serve their own purpose. Pulp fiction is filled with incredible action scenes while also keeping a realistic feel with personal conversations, regret, and emotions.With great performances by every single actor involved especially Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta who both do amazing jobs in keeping the movie realistic while also showing a lot of emotions.The movie is also incredibly filmed. With amazing angles and shooting scenes that make Pulp fiction a beautiful film with beautiful scenery, it's truly one of the best films from the 90s.I highly recommend you watch Pulp Fiction, it's a beautiful film with amazing acting and actors that all perform incredibly.","

"harveybdickens","4 December 2015","Quentin Tarantino's movies are there own genre. 25 years ago however, he was a nobody. Then he directed THIS movie, and this is what put him on the map, as one of the directors to look out for.Pulp Fiction is about a number of different characters, whose stories all intertwine together during the course of this movie. You've got the two hit men Jules Winnfield, and Vincent Vega. You've got Butch Coolidge, a boxer, whose losing his game, so to speak. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, two robbers, who appear at the start, and the end of the movie, although they technically only appear in one stage of the movie.That's one of the interesting things about this movie. It is not told in chronological order. One might think this would confuse the story, but it actually makes it more interesting.This adds to an already interesting story, but the driving force behind the movie is the dialogue. A lot of dialogue based movies can be boring, and this one is boring very occasionally. This certainly is one of the more interesting dialogue based, that keeps people interested for its 2.5 hour length. For this reason it is possibly one of the most quotable movies of all time.Considering that, and how well it is made, it is obvious, due to the content, that this movie isn't for everybody. Some people really won't like it. However anyone who likes great dialogue, will probably like it, cinema nerds (like myself) will probably like it, I certainly enjoyed most of it, and so I give it 8/10","

"s0apt0ken","7 June 2022","Pulp Fiction doesn't have a plot. Or, it doesn't have a linear and evolving plot. Instead, it is just a collection of relatively unrelated stories that include some of the same characters. However, what makes this crime movie special is these stories aren't about the dangerous life and business of a gangster, but instead about just the day to day life of people who happen to be employed by the mob. Now, at first this may seem boring and pointless, but after a closer look, you'll realize that there is one thing about these stories that stands out. The dialogue. Every conversation is unrealistically realistic. People will go on long debates and monologues about everything from french burgers, the metric system, foot massages, tasty burgers, refreshing beverages, why some guy got thrown out of a window because of a foot massage, divine intervention, good coffee, comfortable silences, and just walking the Earth. Every conversation seems like an exaggeration of a conversation you might have. This is only made better by the intermittent action and violence that occurs, which only adds to the complete absurdity that makes this movie so great.Pulp Fiction is one of funniest, most interesting, and most enjoyable movies I have ever seen. 100/100. An absolutely necessary watch.","

"corythejoker","27 March 2021","My opinion this is my all time favorite movie. Tarantino is also my all time favorite director. 1994 was a year with many masterpieces probably my favorite year for film. Pulp fiction is riveting well acted and in my opinion nothing against Forrest Gump or Shawshank Redemption which were also fantastic that were nominated for best picture in 1994. This is my citizen Kane over citizen Kane. This story about 2 hitmen there boss his wife and a boxer on what happens in 2 days is a tour de force to be seen and is the greatest 90s film and the greatest film of all time in my opinion.","

"rebeljenn","17 March 2006","'Pulp Fiction' scores extra stars for setting up an original way of story-telling. The story is told from end to beginning (well, sort of), and it follows a few characters who get caught up in some misunderstanding or mess involving crime or criminal. Thoroughly engaging but often warped and funny, this film is a pleasure to watch. In the final scenes, the viewer learns how the different stories of the characters are connected, bringing an even closer meaning to the film. 'Pulp Fiction' is very creative in its story-telling method. That is what makes this a good film, and without it, this film would be dull and like any other film.","

"leopold-3","18 January 1999","I think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film. The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole ""Jules redemption-speech"" by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown kiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, I'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes: escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. I won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same.","

"McFrogg","5 May 2017","For some strange reason, Pulp Fiction is regarded as a masterpiece, and its director a genius. According to some ancient legends, the movie is supposedly so awesome that most of its fans lose the ability to tell us exactly why it is so darn good.One of my friends used to talk about how great Pulp Fiction was after he saw it with his stoner dad. I had of course heard positive stuff about it before, and decided to be polite and watch it when he showed up at my apartment with the DVD. We turned it off after maybe seven hours or so. Some people will say: ""but you didn't watch the last 20 minutes!!! It's the ending that is good!"". I'm sorry, but I don't have to go outside and eat dog crap to know it's bad for me.I really can't understand what's so great about it. When people talk about this piece of crap, they usually bring up the ""distoibing"" gimp scene, the fat Travolta dance or the part where the hit men accidentally blow the black guy's head off. Clap...clap...? My friend didn't even say why he liked it. He just had a blank look on his face and repeated: ""bring out the gimp, bring out the gimp"" over and over again. Okay, so the last part didn't really happen, but I bet he only liked it because his father told him it was good. But why did his father like it? Drugs? I think many people brainwash themselves into liking Tarantino movies. ""It's Tarantino, therefore it's good! It's Tarantino, therefore it's good!"" Had Tarantino made Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill or Inglorious Bastards under a pseudonym, people would just laugh and say ""what kind of Uwe Boll garbage is this?"".","

"JJohns","27 February 2003","I initially saw this movie because there was alot of talk and press at the time the movie came out. It brought back Travolta's career. Look at the load of movies he pulled out in the 90's after this. And it put Samuel on the map for good. It also acknowledged other underrated great actors.This isn't my favorite movie and I would never have to see it again. It was very disturbing to watch but very real. This movie also went against Hollywood's usual conduct of restraint. This movie had no restraints.I can't even give a summation of the story, but I applaud Q. Taratino for his artistic merit. He is very innovative and different. This movie was based on content, originality and style. I personally thought his best work was True Romance, From Dusk till Dawn, and Resorvoir Dogs. The key is in the script writing. He focuses on real characters with real dialogue. Not the cheesy kind and isn't afraid to touch racial/social differences that may be offensive. I truly think he is one of a kind and Pulp Fiction proved that.","

"cojosh","9 September 2006","Wow, a lot of people have been fooled into believing that this was a great film. I've never seen anything like it, and I hope I never will again. This is one slop of a film, and I'm disgusted to know that it has so many high reviews. It was a confusing ball of goo that amounted to nothing. I didn't care for the characters and never will. What a hopeless bunch of freaks. I don't jump on the ""freak bandwagon"" unless they're natural ones, not arrogant embodiments of deranged entertainment. The glorification of smut is worse than the smut, and that is exactly what this movie is. The sad thing is, I don't believe that some of these actors were acting at all. They were just being themselves. Travolta and Jackson in wigs??? That was scary! The only interesting thing about the movie was the sequence of events. I like the way that it started at one point and ended in the same, but dislike everything in between. The problem with this film is that it tricks the audience into giving it great reviews. It uses the ""peer pressure"" method. You know, ""this movie is for intelligent and cool people"" CRAP!! Well, I'll gladly stand among those who know that this was nothing more than a ""shock flick"". It was produced to see if the letter could be pushed a little further. Unfortunately, it drags what little respect that Hollywood has with it. I'm afraid that this is one of the major stepping stones to a pathetic industry that only produces films for vulgar lust.There's my two pennies, don't spend them all in one place!","

"iron t","20 May 1999","After 4 years, I still consider this the worst movie I have ever seen.  I have yet to watch any thing else with QT's name attached to it. Everything about this film is annoying, (the presence of the ubiquitous Sam Jackson and Steve Buscemi, the weak attempts at shock value, the cameo by the director) but the one element that makes this number one on my all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny.  THREE'S COMPANY reruns have better dialogue (and I hate that show). It's such a shame though, because QT and I do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in movies. My advice is to try a project that tries not to be shocking, funny or hip, because PULP FICTION fails in all three departments miserably.","

"eastcoastguyz","15 May 2005","It seems that Quentin Tarantino must have written this movie, by writing down some gross scenes he wants to play out and then almost as a jump-cut tries to string those scenes together. It doesn't work, what does work are the big stars in the movie to bring people to watch it. They think, a collection of stars, so it must be a great movie. Sometimes it is, but this one isn't.The dance scene was nothing special. People continue to believe that John Travolta is actually a dancer because of the movie Saturday Night Fever. He ""played"" a dance, which isn't the same as being a dancer. He looked overweight and stiff in the dance scene of this movie, although this scene was promoted heavy when the movie first name out. Quentin Tarantino must have thought, that since Travolta played a dancer in another movie, we should have him dance. While Christopher Walken who in addition to being a fine actor is also a real dancer, doesn't dance in this film, which is a shame. While Travolta was great in Get Shorty, this script isn't a mature work. The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. It tries to conceal this fact by showing gross scenes which you get bored with seeing at the first sign of blood. The bad guys aren't just bad, they are stupid. If crime is your business, and you intend to kill someone, just kill them, no sense in lecturing them. It isn't like they are going to improve from this lecture. Maybe Quentin Tarantino wrote this script and then realized it didn't have enough gross stuff, so he put more of it in. The shock value doesn't last long. There are many characters in the story which could have developed into a wonderful story, showing the interplay and relationships between them all, which it could have easily done consider this bore is 2 and a half hours long, but they decided to go for the undergrad film school approach to long scenes which make you wish for a TV ad to break it up. Last and certainly not the least offensive of this movie, is how horrible music was used incorrectly. Nothing but songs tossed in which have nothing to do with anything. This shows he isn't a mature filmmaker who knows what the power of music can do for films. Quentin Tarantino needs to watch more Hitchcock films for starters. Tarantino needs to study characters since all those in this film were pretty much one dimensional. The people who claim this is a master piece don't know what a real master piece is. They have not studied films, they have not lived, and most of all, they don't really think for themselves. The marketing of this film tells them it is hip, so they look at it to be hip.","

"theoledoux","1 November 2020","Every time I watch this movie, I get reminded why they call Quentin Tarantino a master of dialogue. It is a shockingly smart and original movie all the way through. Every actor does a tremendous job at delivering quotable yet realistic lines. It is very tough to decide which scene is the best. The burger scene? The ending scene? The overdose? The escape from the rapists? I guess I will never know which one I prefer, and that, is what makes this film truly iconic.","

"ryanaustinf","29 June 2009","HOLY CRAP! In my whole life I have never seen a film this good. Two hours and thirty minutes just flew by and I didn't even notice it's been an hour when the first part was over. This film left me in awe and I feel like watching it again and again and again. People say this is overrated; well it sort of deserves it! So this is all opinion and the only fact is an event in the movie. -------------------SPOILER LINE---------------- So our main characters are Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson). These characters are two of the best in the whole history of film and they deserved the Oscars they got. Our villain is umm... Since there's no exact villain, this film gets the bonus. Our supporting characters are Butch (BRUCE WILLIS!), Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman), Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer), Pumpkin(Tim Roth), and Marcellus Wallace(Ving Rhames). All these characters play into the film perfectly. The genre of the film is crime, black comedy, and thriller. Well there was crime, at parts I was laughing my ass off, and some parts, my heart was beating so fast. There were no boring moments in this film. The story is told out of order. We start in a Diner and end in a Diner. So I'll summarize the story in its real order. Vincent and Jules get a case containing ....... and then they accidentally kill someone in their car so they have to clean it out. Jules thinks about retiring while the diner they're eating at is held up. Jules stops the robbery and go to a bar where Vincent gets his assignment from Marcellus Wallace. He takes Mia Wallace out. She gets overdosed in drugs. And the rest is spoiling the story. So, I give Pulp Fiction, one of THE GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME, 95% AWESOME! The highest rating so far!","

"zuma777","7 March 2013","Sorry for the image, but if you take a bowl of crap, rearrange it, put some sugar and a little cherry on top, what to you get? ... a bowl of crap.This is the most overrated film of all time. I'm even feeling strange to call it a film. It has no story, no feelings, no plot, no music - just 4 different scenes of disgusting, violent, abusive, offending and racist content put together in a mixed sequence.How this crap scores a 9 on IMDb is beyond me. Sometimes when people see a 9 they automatically deceive themselves into believing this is a masterpiece and that maybe if they didn't like it, something is wrong with their opinion or taste. Nothing's wrong. It's a bad movie from beginning to end. The problem is that sometimes Hollywood movies are over-hyped for business reasons like what happened in Titanic and Avatar which by the way were ""OK"" movies but didn't deserve the huge credit they received.I gave this a 1 because Samuel L. Jackson was the only thing interesting in this disaster. I'm not going to tell those of you that haven't seen it not to, you have to go through the experience on your own and make your fare judgment. Don't listen to anyone's opinion - especially the ones that think if you love this one, then you're COOL!","

"Mighty_sheman","7 June 2005","Simply put Pulp Fiction is the silliest film I have every seen, it puts  Battlefield Earth and The Long Kiss Goodnight (spookily starring the  two leads from this film) firmly in the shadows, they look like rare  vintage wines next to this cheap plonk. The fact it is so highly  revered by so many, and even considered profound, makes me fear for the  very existence of modern society.  There are some fundamental reasons I dislike this film with a passion,  the first being the pacing and substance, the film really mirrors it's  director to perfection, yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start  to finish, enthusiastically about....Nothing! If Qentin was not such an  untalented, cretinous buffoon I would call him the new David Lynch. The  only substance in PF is of the white powdery verity, the film is just a  collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely  together by some sharp but pointless dialogue. The film was too crude,  made purely for shock value. When violence, male rape, drug abuse,  accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as  cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a  highly irresponsible film, and to sell it as some sort of 'smart art'  piece is doubly irresponsible.  Then there is the complete lack of character development and depth.  There are no characters, only 2 dimensional machines created solely to  perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks, they  perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to  what happens in their next scene. Not one of them is even slightly  likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from  perhaps Butch (Willis), did I mention he is a violent thug, murderer  and a thief? Then there is Mia who seems to have little purpose in the  film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where  an over weight Travolta boogies on the dance floor. Yes she is in the  'famous' needle scene as well, but what else? The section featuring  Vince and Mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like Mia  herself, so what was the point? A question I asked of the film  throughout. I quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be  developed, any one of them could have been dropped (apart from Butch)  or their actions performed by a completely new character without making  a spot of difference to the film, their actions were not to be the  subject of scrutiny. That would be asking too much of the Tarantino who  is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool. He is  the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky 'homage'  (ie, he is a thief) action films. Don't believe me? Watch Kill Bill  where he even pays homage to his own film, this one! I do give credit  to him in one respect. He realised that if he re-jigged the order of  plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could  disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was  written on, impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job  narrative structure enhanced the story.  The direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at  times. One scene featuring a near comatose Butch in particular comes to  mind, the camera is stuck dead still on him while Marsellus (Rhames)  uses the m-f word 100 times in about 5 minutes, totally amateurish. The  only memorable performance is from Jackson, who could make the  ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun, he is offset by a  flat performance from Travolta. That brings me to the 'witty' dialogue  which, apart from the violence, is the crux of the piece. It is  unfortunate then, that this dialogue basically consists of idiots  talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers,  milkshake, foot massages, cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some  coffee that is described as gourmet s**t. Some dialogue was witty but  mostly it was just utterly pointless, the characters deliver it with  such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking  about, frankly, a lot of BS. Add this to the fact there is (barring  brief moments in Butch's story) no plot, no emotion and especially no  substance and you have one worthless film. ""Ah you don't get it"" they  all scream, don't make me laugh, the circular narrative and the  ham-fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance.  The ending was hilariously cheap, obviously a desperate attempt to  justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike. Is it meant  to be profound? Well after sitting through the whole film which  consisted of characters that were never developed adequately, where no  actions or events were properly tackled, challenged or explored with  any great thought or depth during which I was never required to care  even once, I was presented with one of the most cheesy, pointless  monologues in film history. Oh and a parody of QT's fans - the  briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go ""ooooh, it  beautiful"". It is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character  that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it,  combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it.  Many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion  because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development, some  have endings that invalidate the rest of the film, others have endings  that are invalidated by the rest of the film, with Pulp Fiction QT has  somehow achieved both simultaneously. You'll figure out what I mean. As  a rule I don't usually let a film's director put me off the film itself  but, after Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino films are now the  exception.","

"TxMike","15 November 2000","Read the external reviews, like Ebert's or Barardinellis', if you want to know more about ""content"" of Pulp Fiction. Following is my personal take on the film.Many have praised this film for ""interweaving 3 different stories."" Ever watch the TV series ""Northern Exposure?"" Every episode consists of 3 different, interwoven stories, and done much better than Tarentino does here. What this film does well is poke fun at the gangster movies, and does it with very witty writing. I especially liked the way these sordid characters got into various ""philosophical discussions"", like why in France a quarter-pounder cannot be called that, because of the metric system. Or why Jackson's character would not eat pork, because it is a dirty animal.To really enjoy this film, you have to numb yourself to all the filthy language and the gratuitous violence. However, it is neither an innovative film nor one with lasting meaning. That is why I rate it 5 of 10, and only that high because of the clever screenplay and direction.That reflects my own preference in movies. I give my highest ratings to such films as ""Longitude"", ""Nixon"", ""Apollo Thirteen"", ""Amistad"" - films based on great true stories. Or just entertaining but inoffensive ones like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Matrix"". Or thought-provoking ones such as ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""American History X"", ""Lone Star"", or ""Good Will Hunting"".I give low ratings to such films as ""The Game"", ""The Usual Suspects"" - films which on the surface seem to dazzle, but in final analysis simply try to fool us into thinking they are something special. I don't think ""Pulp Fiction"" exactly does this, but its fans have given it high praise that I'd bet even its creator would hesitate to do.","

"yusufkaanatanur","11 March 2021","No matter which way you try to look at it, this picture is a masterpiece. The angles are nice, the cinematography is strong, the acting is good, the soundtrack is unmatched but the most important thing this film offers is its storytelling. The story pushes itself in a way that differs it from the other Hollywood movies made at the time. It doesn't really follow a normal ""Guy wants something, gets it"" kind of storyline. Instead it barricades a more Leonesque technique. The kind of storytelling which one would see in old and mostly forgotten pictures like ""The Trio"" or ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" where the story is much more complex than a guy wanting and getting something. This revitalised, superb storytelling, when combined with Tarantino's more down to earth dialogue and imagination, gives us the classic film that is Pulp Fiction.","

"wereuat06-1","23 November 2006","Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest crime stories ever told on screen and portrayed by great actor including Travolta and Jackson. This movie had high expectations after Reservoir Dogs. It did not only live up to those expectations but went above and beyond. It is told by one of the greatest directors of our history with a stylish and violent twist that everyone likes in a while. This movie has everything a perfect movie should have, guns, death, betrayal, and love. This movie keep me pumped the whole way down the road. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a violent and a great story with excellent attitude. It could not have done any better then it was I give this movie a 10 out of 10.","

"shattenjager777","4 April 2005","Quentin Tarrantino is in general better known for the amount of violence in his films than any merits they have, and after seeing ""Pulp Fiction,"" I can see why. The film had an extreme amount of violence, yes, but it had few merits. The stories were none too original or exciting and the final attempt to connect them was completely unsuccessful and really brought to the fore what a disconnected, nonsensical mess the entire film is.The characters are flat and dull, the dialogue is made up of about six total words, five of which cannot be used on network television, the stories aren't exciting, and those stories have an attempted connection that doesn't really connect them. Tarrantino seems to have been playing around with time and non-linear narrative, but the film barely, if at all, made any sense. There seems to be no reason for anything that happens and the unusual narrative, rather than drawing the viewer in, is beyond Tarrantino's (the writer) abilities. Further, Tarrantino draws no interesting characters--even with two skilled and charismatic leads in Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta. The most interesting character is definitely that of Butch the boxer, and even he is little-defined.The performances of all involved were fine, since the characters required so little, highlighted by Bruce Willis (oddly enough) and Samuel L. Jackson and lowlighted by the ever-horrible Patricia Arquette, who can do more to ruin an easy character than any actor I have ever seen this side of Kevin Costner and Patricia Clarkson. The parade of stars seemed to be Tarrantino's attempt to distract from the film, but it wasn't successful, since most of the actors were people who have horrible taste in general (Mr. Travolta, that's your call) and this was like a concatenation of all their wrongdoings.Meanwhile, Tarrantino the director does not distinguish himself in one way or another. It's a fairly standard-looking film that doesn't jump out of the mainstream at all, which was actually rather effective since the violence then seemed much more commonplace, but I don't know that it was Tarrantino's intention. I think if he intended that sort of theme, he would have used a more close up-laden style, so I doubt that he intended to be dull.The film's few redeeming moments were packed near the end, with a hilarious scene of Bruce Willis choosing a weapon with which to kill some tormentors and a look on his face at the end of said scene that is absolutely priceless leading the pack, but a few other good comic moments come near the end and perhaps make up somewhat for the mess that came before them.Overall, I consider ""Pulp Fiction"" a terrible mess of a script with no characterization, bad dialogue, a wildly disconnected story, and no reasons for anything that was directed decently if not well and enacted as well as possible considering its horrendous flaws. The film is most certainly not the masterpiece it is made out to be; it is more the accident it least wants to be. I would suggest it if you don't mind violence and want a good nap, but that's it.","

"Skeletors_Hood","23 January 2003","Why this movie is so popular escapes me.  I watched this movie at the recommendation of my friends, who all thought it was hilarious.  I found no humor anywhere, only lame philosophy wrapped up in glorified criminal activities.  I for one am glad that Forrest Gump won the Oscar over this load of bull.  I have never been able to watch anything with John Travolta or Bruce Willis since this came out, and it took me awhile to forgive Samuel Jackson for this movie as well.  Tarantino should never have been allowed to direct again.Skip this crap and rent something else, or you might lose respect for the actors involved.  I sure did.","

"Hunca","31 January 1999","Well, I finally saw 'Pulp Fiction'. Hadn't after all this time, but I've heard *so* much ta-doo over it, so I rented it.UGH.I guess I must not be film critic material, because I didn't appreciate the 'art' of this film, or its 'brilliance', or any 'statement' it might have made. It was unpleasant, filled with scumbag people I cared nothing about, doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue. It jumped around in time, circling back to where it opened, but from another viewpoint, and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling, it doesn't save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting.When the characters could get away for a second from m-f-ing all over the place, there *was* some interesting verbal exchange... bright and witty and even vaguely profound, but Kafka it ain't. I have to say, I thought all the performances were incredible, esp Samuel Jackson, but can't Quentin Tarantino stay OUT of any of his own films?! Even playing a 'nicer' guy, he comes off as a borderline psycho. I thought it was *very* interesting, tho, to see Chicago Hope's Eric Stoltz in there as a drug dealer.I worry about people's minds, if this is what they think of as a great movie. EEK! A movie about redemption? Gee... I didn't see any of that. If perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive, I'd hardly call that 'redemption', if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place. An earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of 'em, and I would have applauded. People think it's really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays.Time to get some mouthwash for my eyes, and get the stench out of 'em.","

But for all the people who like to spoil the fun by asking the question why, here's why: excellent performances (especially Samuel L. Jackson & John Travolta as a pair of hit men), fun characters and possibly the greatest screenplay of all time. For anyone who hasn't seen Pulp Fiction, watch it. For those who have seen it, watch it again and revisit Butch, Jules, Vincent, Mia, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny. Thank you, Quentin.Relive one of the greatest films of all time 10/10.

"Smells_Like_Cheese","18 August 2004","I'm not sure why, but I really loved this film. There is no reason, I just loved it. My sister told me that if I liked ""Kill Bill"" than I should enjoy ""Pulp Fiction"". I noticed that it was also #16 on the top 250. How could I say no to that? I am not a huge Quentin Tarentino fan, to let everyone know. I know there is a huge die hard fans who can't stand if he is bad rapped. I am not one of those people. But! I do think the man has talent that people reconize almost immidatley. All of his films are on the top 250 if you haven't noticed.
The film isn't for everyone. You have to be in a certain mood to watch it. It is pretty sick, so, it's not for everyone. But I would recommend if you love action flicks.10/10","

But on the whole it just screams self-indulgence. Topped off with Tarantino stepping in front of the camera. Ploddingly slow too often in an attempt to be arty and edgy, it just exposes the poor writing that the shifted timelines can't save. No investment in characters, or plot. Just a collection of scenes and ideas drowning in a lake of stagnant dialogue and overly long, trite scenes with characters and actions that make no sense. Very disappointing.","

"atlasmb","7 October 2022","Quentin Tarantino is a storyteller. With ""Pulp Fiction"" he demonstrates some of his favorite story features, like portrayal of a violent subculture and a cast of colorful characters. As the film tells us at its start, the pulp fiction genre is characterized by the lurid-a word that can mean merely colorful or extremely sensational. His films often border on film noir, but unlike most noir, there is a pulpy depth of character development that comes from extended dialogue.Except for a brief detour into a seemingly unrelated sub-story, the film begins with Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), two men on the way to an unknown assignation. As they drive along, they discuss continental differences in language and culture. They philosophize openly and reveal significant aspects of their life views. When the viewer eventually realizes the nature of their outing, there is incongruence between their casual demeanor and the significance of their errand.Tarantino serves up his characters with heaping slices of humanity that undercut the judgments one might make if he was not privy to their internal systems of logic and morality. He reminds us that the old actor's precept is true: all people/characters believe they are justified in their actions.Vincent and Jules are not the central characters throughout the film. The story meanders in a non-linear way and indulges in detours that appear to be unrelated, but Tarantino has his eye on the entire, relevant whole. Though he may indulge in flights of fancy simply for the fun of doing so, he has a cohesive vision. Those flights of fancy are some of the most enjoyable moments in the film, like the restaurant called Jack Rabbit Slim's, where Vincent spends some time with the wife (Uma Thurman) of his boss. It's a restaurant that anyone might want to visit, filled with entertaining design elements and colorful people.As in at least four other films before, Tarantino puts Travolta on a dance floor and capitalizes on his ability to deliver memorable, if not iconic, performances.Tarantino gives us dialogue that is richly quotable. No wonder so many fans enjoy his films.Tarantino is definitely an auteur. His artistic vision is as recognizable as Hitchcock's or Woody Allen's. ""Pulp Fiction"", for reasons I have mentioned, is like a primer on how to engage an audience and take them on a journey. This is a film classic that will, no doubt, inspire other writers and directors.","

"Infofreak","6 June 2002","Today I just heard about the death of Dee Dee Ramone, and after getting over the initial shock, it made me think about 'Pulp Fiction'. This ground breaking movie, much like the ground breaking music of the Ramones, has been endlessly discussed, praised, damned, ripped off and copied so many times that you can easily lose sight of the fact that what you have here is a genuinely original, exciting and important work of art that when experienced for the umpteenth time STILL never fails to thrill and amuse. The many talentless punk bands who have recycled watered down and witless imitations of Da Brudders music haven't made 'Rocket To Russia' any less brilliant, only more so. The same thing goes with Quentin Tarantino's countless less talented followers. They just make you appreciate 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' even more.This movie is one of the few I would describe as perfect. I honestly cannot fault a thing about it. The brilliant dialogue has become legendary, the elliptical structure of the script (though influenced by Kubrick's 'The Killing', and the experiments of the French New Wave) has been much imitated and will continue to do so, the fantastic group of actors, who range from has-beens (at the time) to cult favourites, are all uniformly excellent, and the soundtrack is one of the coolest and most eclectic ever assembled. In short, this is a modern classic, and required viewing for all movie buffs, especially 70s nuts like myself. 'Pulp Fiction' is as good as any movie you care to name. To (mis)quote Flavor Flav - ""believe the hype!""","

"cyberknight","23 March 2005","In one word: boring.Get the comments people make about this movie. You have those that say it's ""innovative and controversial"", others that it's ""violent and refreshing"", others that say it's a ""rebellious masterpiece"". Yes, you can check it out, absolutely all comments fall into such kind of comments. Why? I have a theory: those guys have NEVER watched a good movie. And I mean it! Violence? Gosh, this movie was only less boring than ""Natural Born Killers"", the worst movie ever made (don't worry, I have a ""good"" comment prepared for that crap, also).There is only one really violent scene in the whole movie, when the pervert binds the boxer Bruce (and the other guy I can't even remember who was) and prepares to torture them. I can't remember if he actually does torture them, but that's absolutely irrelevant, the situation the characters are put into is what really matter. And Bruce choosing the sword when he escapes, oh my, that was really nice (the only good moment in the whole movie). Wanna see lots of fake blood, watch ""Happy Tree Friends""! But do you want true violence, watch ""Spoorloos"". Paraphrasing it, if you think killing is the worst thing somebody can do, you haven't seen anything yet!It's absolutely amazing that crimes like rape and kidnapping are considered less severe than a murder in our ""civilization"". Okay, a murder is terrible, but nothing compares to the suffering of those that survive (not only the victims, but also those around them...)""Pulp Fiction"" is about terminating people without a good reason, nothing more. I see no violence in some idiot blowing up a nameless character's head (MTv's Movie Awards parody of the car scene was excellent, they really got the idea!!!) This movie only shows more fake blood than most ""hollywoodian"" movies, but what's the point? If it created a revolution in Cinema, it was to make it ""yuckier""... I have seen much more blood in ""Hellraiser"", which, by the way, has blood AND violence! All Tarantino's movies are too shallow to show true violence...Too bad IMDb doesn't allow voting zero for a movie...","

I personally think this is the film that made Samuel L. Jackson as this crazy badass. This is simply Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece that needs to be watched if your a movie lover. Definitely one of the best films of the 90's, and deserves to be in anyone's movie collection cause it just ain't one without this. This really is a true original, some complain that this film is a bit overrated but let me tell you this deserves to be overrated.

The first one is about an overdose, the second (and weirdest) is about a boxer and the third (in my opinion the best) about 'divine intervention'. Quentien Tarantino puts these stories into the blender, adds the best ensemble cast ever seen, style, the coolest dialogue ever and some excellent music and the result is a first class movie.

"benjaminspetrofsky","17 March 2014","Seriously, what is with all of the one star ratings on this film? What a disgrace. What the people HATED about this movie is exactly what makes it good. So many people complain there is no storyline. Bullshit. If you were actually paying attention to the film you would find that this picture was divided into different segments and switched around. Just because it's something different than what you're used to doesn't mean it's bad. It's called a ""non parallel plot."" Famous authors and filmmakers do this all the time, you just may have not noticed. Quentin Tarantino just takes it to another level because he has a very unique style where he likes to give you major cliffhangers and start the next substory, making you crave for more (an you do get it, just later on.) If anything, its a series of several stories, and the film is edited the way it is to show how these different stories intertwine. It's not that complicated of a concept, but the low intelligence of many viewers may result in complete confusion of what's going on.Flat characters? I really don't even need to get into this one. The characters all had their own distinct personalities AND YES, character development. If Jules' transition from crime in the beginning to wanting to get out of the business in the end isn't character development, then I don't know what is. There is an obvious misconception here of what character development actually is. And too much dialogue? That's Tarantino's style. What's with this sudden rule that a film should always be visually told and not told verbally? Bullshit. Art is something like a free for all. It works here. The dialogue is natural and is witty. I heard one reviewer say Tarantino is self indulgent here because his dialogue represents his thoughts too much. WTF? Just because he has a wordy script style means he's too self indulgent? He's simply writing a script with witty dialogue, there is no ego trip here. This claim is simply and utterly ridiculous. And if you're complaining about him being in his own movies, go ahead and say that Alfred Hitchcock was self indulgent and a bad filmmaker. I am very sure many people here wouldn't dare claim that.Overall, this is indeed one of the greatest films ever made. And that isn't because it's a fad film like many others say. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a film that has completely revolutionized the way film handles dialogue and the editing of a film's story. If people are unable to acknowledge that then they are only limiting their perception of what has made films evolve to what it is today. Films like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""2001 A Space Odyssey,"" ""Psycho,"" ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,"" etc., are all films with this kind of status. If you don't enjoy this film, then that is fine. However, to deny the importance or influence this film has graced upon the medium is simply foolish and unenlightened on the part of the viewer.This is simply one of the most entertaining films you will ever see in your life if you can keep up with the pace and the story. It may take a few viewings if you're the kind of person that can't understand this kind of plot, but I guarantee almost every time that if you watch this film over and over and study it like I have and numerous other classics, you will notice all of the big and little things that make this film what it is. It's truly a remarkable film. There may be little symbolism beside's Jules' commentary on the bible and reciting of biblical passages, but this film is more so about the entertainment than symbolic storytelling. There are two different kinds of films in that way, the ones that try to allude to something symbolic or important like ""A Clockwork Orange"" and there are other films that rely on entertaining the viewer like this film and ""Jaws."" I'm sure not many people will call ""Jaws"" a bad film either. Anyway, don't listen to the one star reviewers. They simply didn't understand the film, its story, or its style. This film is a real treat.","

From what I seen, it was a day in the life of Jules and Vincent. That's why this movie is so excellent.  It is just nothing anybody has ever seen, and the title warns you before you enter the theater, and also provides a definition of ""pulp"" before the movie starts.  The performances are amazing, providing an all star cast, throughout.  It's kinda hard who takes the cake.. Samuel L.

"bill2021","18 July 2023","I attempted to watch ""Pulp Fiction"" again recently and it was obviously a very silly movie almost a parody of itself. The violence is cartoonish and the dialogue is laughable. Travolta seemed like a guy desperately trying to act ""cool"" and with time this mess of a movie just comes off as ridiculous. Samuel L. Jackson's character pulls it off somewhat better but it still comes across as an SNL skit rather than a serious movie. I suppose with the great stories and acting on television these days movies like this come off as lame now when 30 years ago they seemed edgy. The director's style tends to make this movie seem more like several clips put together with very little flow as a whole. The director seemed to be much more interested in being cute and flashy vs. Being a serious movie maker. As a silly cartoonish comedy it still is not that bad but overall it is severely poorly written and directed as compared to some of the HBO, Netflix, Showtime and Apple TV crime shows you see in 2023.

"Grimbleton","16 January 2021","Probably Tarantino's best film, Pulp Fiction is a self-sidetracking and highly combustible film that out-does itself at every turn. Centered around several people who's individual arcs all meet at the fork in the road, the film does a masterful job of developing characters and telling a story about people striving to keep and flaunt their power. The performances by the star-studded cast are absolutely stunning and are only augmented by Tarantino's whimsical dialogue, with almost a twenty-minute sequence with just Vincent and Jules talking about nonsense. Every scene only enhances the depth of these characters, providing great insight into the personalities that make up people like Butch or Marsellus by providing a window into the way they think and interact with others. Although the jumbled time-frame can cause confusion at first, it all eventually falls into place and wraps itself up in the end, making for one interesting film. Probably my favorite aspect of the film is how it treats every character like a normal human being, foregoing the heroics and the pretense of a ""primary protagonist"" - this leaves the viewer with a film where they observe the initial position of a character and watch that character go through a set of struggles completely unique (and in some cases absolutely mental) that put their personalities and beliefs to the test. All in all, this is Tarantino's best film and shows how ditching the traditional film setup creates a film with an unprecendented form, all only to aid in its success.","

"klastaitas","7 October 2020","After Reservoir Dogs Quentin Tarantino was asked to direct Men in Black, Speed and numerous other titles, however he refused all so he could concentrate on writing the masterpiece that has now become the daring, hilarious and beloved Pulp Fiction.
Pulp Fiction was originally planned to be three separate stories all written and directed by a different person. Tarantino got Roger Avery and Tony Scott on board but after a few months of writing Tarantino realised that he had to direct the full thing. He adopted novelistic techniques such as non-linear structure and intertwining narratives to craft the astounding story of two robbers, two gangsters, a gangster's wife and a boxer.
The film is a glorious ""F you"" to conventional storytelling, there is no plot but somehow it manages to pull you into a world of witty dialogue and horrible violence. There isn't a moment in this film when I fell bored, after each rewatch it always retains the same joy I had upon my first watch.
Not only is the film great in of itself but opens up a whole different world of cinema I had no idea existed. It's because of this film I discovered Jean-Luc Godard and Federico Fellini, it's because of this film that I found the treasure trove of Roger Corman's Edgar Allen Poe adaptations which then led to me finding the cult classic Faster Pussycat...Kill Kill! This movie managed to have so many references, without every feeling contrived, that there's probably still some ones only known to Tarantino himself.
Although the directing is top-notch there is no doubt that writing is the star of the show, Tarantino manages to go off on tangents about burgers, feet and five dollar shakes without ever making a dull moment. Tarantino says the Sicilian speech in True Romance is the best of writing he has done, but for me every line of this film beats that speech.
Not only did this film have a profound impact on audiences, but it also greatly affected directors and writers at the time. Pulp Fiction did for 90's and 2000's what Easy Rider did for the 70's, stuck the middle finger up to ""normal"" films and decided to go in a completely opposite route. Pulp Fiction completely changed movies after that. Guy Ritchie came about,adopting the same intertwining story technique and the same sense of humour and we must not forget Amores Perros and 21 grams all amazing films influenced by Pulp Fiction.
The affect this film has had on the audience and film in general is why I value it as one of the greatest movies ever made (and is also why I watch once a month, I just can't help myself).","

"HotToastyRag","27 June 2019","I know I'm not the only one who doesn't like Pulp Fiction, even though I wasn't able to find any like-minded people at film school. It's just not my cup of tea: excessive language, excessive violence, cheesy dialogue, strange visuals, and a story that's meant to be a throwback to old pulp fiction novels of the 1950s. If that is your cup of tea, you might love it!Famous for John Travolta's comeback, Uma Thurman's dancing, and Samuel L. Jackson's monologue about his favorite Bible passage, it's a tongue-in-cheek action drama about two hitmen, one of which falls for their boss's wife. There's quite a bit more to the story to that, so don't throw anything at me for condensing it as such, but it's told so out of order, and the movie is so long, it was practically impossible for me to understand anything more than that. At nearly three hours, even though I watched the censored version on television, I didn't get much more out of the movie than a ton of violence and some terrible wigs. I don't know why the dance scene became so famous; to me it looked incredibly stupid. Again, don't throw anything at me, but I obviously didn't get the point.If you do want to give it a shot, you'll see a huge supporting cast of Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, and Amanda Plummer. This is a highly acclaimed classic from the 1990s, but if you don't like it or don't even get all the way through it, you're not the only one.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language and violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.","

"gedikreverdi","7 January 2021","Vincent had to take the wife of the boss out and do whatever she'd want. They went to dine out and won the trophy for the dancing competition. Back home she tried the coke Vincent just got and overdosed. Vincent drove to the dealer house and he had to inject the adrenaline shot into her chest and she woke up and they came back and promised it'd be their secret. Butch the boxer cheated the boss and killed his opponent at the match and went to his girlfriend fabienne with an exotic Colombian cab driver. They had fun and in the morning he had to get back to their flat before escaping because fabienne forgot his fathers watch. At their flat he just saw a gun with a silencer in the kitchen and Vincent came out of the bathroom and he shot him dead and left. On his way back to the motel he saw the boss by the lights and hit him and had an accident. Butch took a refuge in a guitar shop and the boss came after and the owner dominated them and called a friend over and they turned out to be some sick guys into bondage and rape. One of them raped the boss while their slave was watching butch. Butch untied himself and knocked the slave out and wanted to run away but turned back and killed one of the guys with a sword and the boss shot the rapist in the crotch and would call people over to torture him to death. He also wanted butch to leave town that day and they're fine. With the chopper in front of the store he got back to fabienne and they left the motel. It was even better than what I expected it to be. When they killed the young men who stole from their boss Vincent and Jules killed the guy that tried to kill them but failed miserably and Jules thought it was divine intervention. They spare the black guys life and took him with them. Vincent accidentally shot the guy in the face and stained the car. They went over to jimmys house (Tarantino) and their boss sent Winston to help them out. They cleaned the car, they were washed naked and wore jimmys tshirts and shorts. At the coffee shop the couple wanted to rob the restaurant while they were having breakfast and Vincent was at the bathroom. Jules wanted to quit the job because he felt gods touch when they miraculously missed the bullets of the giant pistol. Jules said he tries hard to be the shepherd and repeated the quotation from the Bible confessing he's no idea what it's about. He didn't killed them and let them leave with the customer wallets and his money except for his wallet. I can't tell how almost 3 hours passed. I will definitely watch it again","

"joseayarza","27 July 2002","OK, I loved this film. LOVED IT. But it's not perfect. The main problem with the movie is that the best scene is at the beginning: the histerical what? conversation. This scene comes very early in the movie, so you would expect that the rest should equal or top that perfect scene. And while the movie is always interesting and has some other moments of great humor, it never reaches the greatness of that scene. Compared to that incredible scene, the rest of the film is a disappointment. That wouldn't be a problem if the scene had been left to the end, but since it's at the beginning....Putting that aside, this movie is so original. The characters speak a lot. In many movies, the characters only speak the necessary to advance the plot, and the action is given more importance. However, in Pulp Fiction, characters are given the chance to talk, as we talk in everyday life. As a result, the characters seem incredibly real and we care a lot about them. The non-linear structure is another plus. It's a very intelligent way to grab the audience and not letting go. At times the movie gets a little boring but you never lose interest because you always want to know whether the movie will move forward or backwards. Movies that play with time always work. Well, most of the time, at least.What about the acting? My personal favorite was Samuel L. Jackson. But everybody did a good job including Quentin Tarantino as the guy who helps the guys hide the body but is afraid that his wife might arrive and discover the whole deal. Uma Thurman was also great at portraying that strange woman who apparently likes to play with people's feelings, knowing that they're afraid of her, because of her husband. John Travolta  was my least favorite. He was too inexpressive for me, although, perhaps he did that intentionally because the character required it.Overall: 9/10.","

"lee_eisenberg","21 October 2005","""Pulp Fiction"" has partly gone down in history as the movie that revived John Travolta's career, but it's more than that. A look into the lives of several criminals, it's likely to shake up almost anyone. The first time that I ever saw the movie, my dad (who'd already seen it) sent me out of the room for the scene where Bruce Willis...well, I won't spoil it in case you haven't seen it. Also, while we were watching it, I was cracking up at the language - I can't even count how many curse words they used. This is one movie that will probably never get shown on network TV - they would probably have to cut more than half the movie (including Samuel L. Jackson's wallet).All in all, director Quentin Tarantino created a real masterpiece here. Top-notch acting (that spawned some famous lines) and a great script combined for a real treat. Uma Thurman's scene might make some people's skin crawl, but if not, then enjoy.","

"ryan_kuhn","13 February 2005","There's just something about Pulp Fiction that makes it great. It took me a while to figure it out, but I think I found it. This may sound weird, but I think that it's the upbeat message found deep within the movie. What is so upbeat about a story involving 2 hit men (Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta) who kill at 4 people during the course of the movie, a crooked boxer who promises to take a dive (Bruce Willis), and a drug pusher (Writer/Director/Average-at-best Actor Quentin Tarantino)? It's not what they do, but how they come to their decisions, the major decisions that they make during the movie that a hopeful vibe comes about. Take the characters Vincent (Travolta, in an Oscar nominated role) and Jules (Jackson) as two under-armed hit men. After the two whack 3 rookie drug dealers, then accidentally shoot their inside man, each goes off their own way and ""save"" someone, both metaphorically and physically, and in doing so, are saved themselves, again both in the physical and metaphoric sense of being saved. The aspect of Pulp Fiction most remember is the script. Things are said by Tarantino's characters that had not been said in movies in years. What would normally be cut out by antsy editors are left in here to give the characters depth, add humor to the movie, and gives the audience something to remember. Who forgets the first scene of the movie after the opening credits, where Vincent and Jules discuss hamburgers in Europe. Or the Bible verse sermonized by Jules before he goes through with business. And of course, the music selections made by Tarantino are almost as important as the script or the actors. It is said that Quentin will pick the music for his movies before he writes the script, it is that important to him, and he uses this extra ""character"" in the movie pitch-perfect. The opening credits employ the use of ""Miserlou,"" which has become synonymous with Tarantino and features songs from the 60s and 70s to add more depth to each character. We know the Jules is a funk fan, as he chooses to play ""Jungle Boogie"" in his car, and that Mia (Uma Thurman) is adding an undertone of sexuality by playing ""Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon"" while entertaining Vincent. This scene comes after ""Son of a Preacher Man"" welcomes Vincent into her home before the big date at the 60s restaurant where we get to see Mr. Saturday Night Fever dance again. The lure to Pulp Fiction comes from the sum of the parts. The acting is great, humor comes from unexpected places, notably in the final act with Harvey Keitel's man who cleans up problems, and the music all add up to a good movie. The underlying sense of hope is what gives Pulp Fiction it's stature as one of the great movies of the 1990s.","

"dragokin","25 August 2013","When Pulp Fiction hit the theaters it had an incredible word-of-mouth recommendation. And Palme d'Or cemented its reputation. Bear in mind, it was before internet was relevant and watching movies online was possible. Therefore it was a must see. And after the movie i was satisfied but also asked myself self: Was that it?Some years down the line i've seen more contemporary TV shows from the US and it became clear why Pulp Fiction stood apart. As the title suggest it is a pulp novel brought to screen, done brilliantly, if you accept there is an extraordinary way to do a below-average thing. Why the critics saw a masterpiece in it is hard to explain, but it simply isn't. There were other things where Pulp Fiction excelled. For example, the soundtrack became an inevitable part of any CD collection at the end of the 20th century.The way i understood Tarantino after watching some interviews, he is a movie buff and makes movies he always wanted to see. Although not the only to try this approach, he is one of the lucky few that made a living out of it.Overall, Pulp Fiction is an exercise in marketing. The title, as well as author's statements, suggest it is an entertaining movie. However, a lot of people read higher meaning into it, elevating it's reputation to being one of the best movies of all times.","

There are some amazing scenes in this movie, for example the beginning where Vincent and Jules are interrogating Brett, that whole scene is fantastic, also it's my favorite part of the movie. The reason why I say it's okay is because I only really was interested in the movie when Samuel L. Jackson was on scene. I'm not saying that because I'm a big Samuel L. Jackson fan, I'm saying that because he was the most interesting character in the movie and he was my favorite character. There are a few other really good scenes, but sadly I just didn't think that there were that many.","

"BA_Harrison","16 March 2014","Have you read my IMDb review of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs? The one where I say that, although the film is far from what I would class as original, the director unashamedly plundering the annals of obscure/cult/foreign cinema, the manner in which it is presented makes it a marvellous work of art in its own right?Same thing applies here. Only more-so.Pulp Fiction is an exquisite patchwork-quilt of a movie, stitched together from ideas, elements and scenes gathered together by Tarantino during his formative years as a movie-obsessed video store clerk. Assembled with an unerring eye for detail and the vision of a true artist, the film is a marvel to behold—over two and a half hours of pure cinematic brilliance which proves just as captivating for me now as when I first clapped eyes on it almost two decades ago.Bold and bloody, with stunning performances from a wonderful ensemble cast, a flawless soundtrack, witty (and highly quotable) dialogue, and even a character called Brett, this impeccable slice of gritty neo-noir is fully deserving of top marks. 10/10.","

Some people apparently found it clever to tell the movie's stories out of chronological order. In fact it undercut any feelings one could have for the characters and made the movie far more tedious then it had to be. The first half is merely dull and boring.Then it becomes ugly, gross, vicious and disgusting. It ends up being forgettable and sickening.Out of the 5,0000 movies and 50,000 television episodes I have seen in my life, this would rank about #8 in the 10 worst.

It's because its flawless, seamless, and no matter how many times you see the movie (and I guarantee, you will see it more than five times), it never gets boring, and there is always something new and unseen to catch your attention.Tarantino has crafted a timeless movie, and it will be remembered in years, and years, and years to come as one of cinemas greatest masterpieces, alongside Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and The Godfather.The cast are impeccable, and this film resurrected two flagging careers in Willis and Travolta, especially Travolta, whose every film for the next three years would be box office gold, and it's down to this.Plus don't forget, not many people had heard of Samuel L. Jackson before this, and after this, he's been in nearly every film ever made since, and you watch them, because you are waiting for that Jules Winfield magic.Every scene is wonderful, every set piece is perfect, and the script is sparkling, its pure gold.The weak link in the film?

The non-linear and looping time order of the scenes smacks of an effort to cover up the lack of coherence in plot and character. The movie is like several episodes of a TV show thrown together.Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities. The actors are doing a fine job with the crap they are given. However the distinct lack of a coherent plot, the disjointedly interwoven and half-baked story lines, the absence of characterization and incorrectly using of the music, makes this movie a good example of bad Cinema!","

"KFL","15 May 2000","Movies can either entertain or edify; ideally, they do both. Pulp Fiction failed to entertain me. Perhaps that's just me. I grant it's funny in places, but I couldn't manage laughter in the middle of a homosexual rape, a gangland hit, a drug overdose, a kid getting his head blown off, etc. I suppose I must be abnormal in some way.Does it edify? It makes many references to other films; I don't think that counts. It shows us (several times) how crucial timing can be in visiting the restroom. No, I don't think that's it either. Some say it's about the ""redemption"" of the Jackson and Willis characters. Whatever redemption may have taken place seems very superficial and unconvincing.On the positive side, several of the performances were brilliant. The screenplay is undeniably clever. But that's not enough to make me want to recommend this movie to someone.","

"southdavid","3 February 2020","My Tarantino retrospective continues with ""Pulp Fiction"" a film I know well, and love. Having been slightly underwhelmed by ""Reservoir Dogs"" a few weeks back I was delighted to find that ""Pulp Fiction"" is as Iconic as ever.Told with a convoluted timeline, ""Pulp Fiction"" revolves around two Hitmen, Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta), who recover a briefcase for their boss, the criminal Kingpin Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Several calamities befall them as they attempt to return the case. Wallace then arranges for fading boxer Butch Coolidge to take a dive in a prize fight, when Butch double crosses him, Wallace goes after him, which has extreme and unexpected outcomes for both of them.Iconic really is the only word that fits. Each scene is chocked full of quotable dialogue and legendary moments of cinema. So many sections have been parodied in things like ""The Simpsons"" and ""Spaced"", the film is a juggernaut of popular culture. The jumping backwards and forwards in time, help take what is a relatively straightforward story to the next level. There is a good time to be had just mentally putting the film together again in the correct order.Visually, it's a step up from ""Reservoir Dogs"" as the camera is much more dynamic that it was, travelling with characters through sets and shooting locations. Performance wise too it's a lot better, flush with the success of ""Dogs"" Q.T was able to keep the best from that cast, but also attract some enormous talent. Samuel L Jackson is probably the standout. . and this is probably the best performance of his career. Every line, every intonation, every eye bulge is (and here's that word again) Iconic. The music choices are fabulous - just as they were with ""Dogs"". Every song fits the tone of directly into the scene perfectly.It's not totally perfect though. Tarantino's scenes in front of the camera make me cringe. He's not a good actor, and on top of that his use of the N-word seems a bit egregious, or that a character like Jules would let him get away with it.That though doesn't spoil what is quite simply one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps even the only true masterpiece in Tarantino's catalogue (I'll see as I check out the rest).","

"Galina_movie_fan","21 April 2006","I just love ""Pulp Fiction"". I loved it when I saw if for the first time back in 1994 with my then 13-year old son in the theater, and I loved it again when I saw it last weekend on TV. Every time I see it, it seems to get better and better. I am fascinated by the incredible pace, witty dialogs, and brilliant writing - every piece of the puzzle falls in the right place, and in the end I don't care a bit about the mysterious case. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a glorious example of the fact that there is no low subject for Art. It is amazing how a work of art can consist of so many trashy elements, which is alluded to in the title of the film. It is populated by characters that came from the pages of cheap ""pulp fiction"" novels - gangsters, philosophical hit men, drug addicts and drug dealers, dangerous and sensual mistresses, naive girlfriends, crooked prizefighters with hurt prides and prized golden watches with long and deep histories. Tarantino and his co-writer Roger Avary took the clichés of hundreds of films, comic books and twenty-five-cent paperbacks and by magic of their talents turned them into something fresh, sparkling, clever, funny and incredibly enjoyable. I should mention Tarantino's taste for music - the soundtrack for ""Pulp Fiction"" (as for all of his films) is just killer. And last but not least - how well Tarantino works with his actors, in this film everybody shines. There are no bad performances in ""Pulp Fiction"". For me, it is a perfect film and a true source of joy, one that I've experienced dozens of times and am always ready for again.I've read many times on these boards that ""Tarantino is a rip-off artist"", that ""he takes bits and pieces (not influences) from other movies."" I often think of him as of a young boy who loves to play with his toys. For him, the toys are the old movies that he adores and he brings his love and admiration of these films to his own work. He is not greedy; he invites us to share his love, to play together, to have as much fun watching his films as he did while making them. Tarantino does not make profound statements or ask eternal questions, but what he does do is entertain, and he does it marvelously - with style, class, irony, wit, and talent. When I am in the presence of a great work of art I know the feeling, and Tarantino's film is a great work of art that happened to be very enjoyable. I cannot resist. Like any time of day is a good time for blueberry pie, any time of day and any day of the week is a good time to watch and enjoy ""Pulp Fiction"".",NA

"backup-50362","16 January 2017","As someone who first watched it in 2017, I don't see why this is in the top movies list, and that first part of the sentence might be the reason why.This movie's formula: ridiculous early 90's clothing, lots of foot fetish undertones, coked up dumb sluts who'd shove anything up their nose like toddlers, and men being killed in pointlessly excessive ways. Trying to glorify cliché black gang ""culture"" and mafioso themes. Weird, occasionally charming but unfitting jokes. Smoking in almost every scene. Insanely long intro sequence. Just as pointlessly long and non-engaging scenes that offer no substance, nothing to get you interested in what they're talking about, just casual chatter stretched over 2,5 hours. I couldn't finish watching it.My only guess is that some parts of the movie were considered ""badass"" at the time, it's 23 years old after all, which is why people are so looking at it trough nostalgia glasses. But it definitely doesn't hold up. And my movie expectations are already as low as ever, since nowadays most movies are utter crap. Some of Tarantino's more recent movies at least had some things going for them - gore, humor, cheesiness so cringy that it kind of makes you like it. But this one - doesn't hold up.None of the characters, except maybe John Travolta's are likable or interesting. There was nothing to keep me watching this. As soon as it switched to Bruice Willis' storyline I had to check out. That was just like watching a boring couple trough a hidden camera having a normal day. Wasn't this supposed to be a crime/drama movie? The ""interesting part"" never seems to begin. The acting was pretty corny and unbelievable as well.Overall feels like a low-budget ""avant garde"" movie shot as a school project, but I know it's far from that. That's just how it looks and feels like.I wanted to like it, but it just can't happen. I thoroughly enjoyed movies from as far as 60 years ago, so age can't excuse it, it was just too focused on that time frame and those cheesy, bland topic points. I don't blame Tarantino, it was one of his early movies, I'm just spellbound at how this movie is so highly rated.People seem to look too deeply for meaning where there is none.

"ACollegeStudent","15 May 2023","Rating: 5.9Gonna get obliterated for this rating but I felt like I wasted my time. I get this movie was unorthodox to the movies coming out at the time with its non-linear narrative, gratuitous violence, down-to-earth dialogue, and absurd collection of plot points in act two we went from a boxing match to a gay BDSM chamber run by racists. But these alone didn't make it worthwhile. There are various interpretations about what the message of the movie is whether it's about seeking redemption like with Butch saving Marcellas, Jules leaving crime, etc., but it's not really about the message it's just pulp fiction: some raunchy stuff happening on a whim because life is not a linear sensical narrative with consistent uplifting messages. I didn't find the dialogue funny and I found a lot of the scenes nonsensical like how Butch decides to casually stroll into his apartment with no disguise and make breakfast while being hunted, and conveniently Vincent leaves his gun out in the open. If I wanted to see something with the spontaneity and pointlessness of life I'd just go outside. For me, this was disappointing.",NA
"bcaulford","1 May 2013","for starters I could kind of tell that this was a Quentin Tarantino movie because all his movies seem to be dramatic or I guess you could say realistic and bold. This is a harsh story about drugs, robberies, and just overall mischief. Vincent Vega played by John Travolta was involved in a robbery of a diner right as the movie began. Making himself seem like an upstanding young man he is also heavily involved with heroin and mob like activity. Things get strange when he is asked by his mobster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to escort his wife, Mrs. Mia Wallace, while he is out of town. It seems like a recipe for disaster however not in the way one would normally think. The two did not hook up but Mia was in a deadly situation when she mistook Vince's heroin for cocaine and snorted it and overdosing. When Vince finds her he takes her to Lance's house where he normally buys his drugs and gives Mia an adrenalin shot to her heart. That situation could have been messy if they had screwed up in any way. Overall I thought this was a good movie although sometimes hard to follow. The harsh truth to it all gives it the essence of a Quentin Tarantino film.",NA
"dominicmichaelduffy","3 August 2023","I've heard so much about Pulp Fiction and how it was a such a great movie- therefore I was excited to sit down and just enjoy what I thought would be a great film.As I watched it I thought there was going to be some brilliant plot I had missed out on however when who I had thought to be the main character was murdered half way into the movie I was very confused and that left me pondering for the rest of the film.Now don't get me wrong it was a good movie. It was well written and the different plots intertwined well but I felt it lacked that final plot. I couldn't believe it was ranked the inside the top 10 movies of all time. Ahead of so many great films like Forrest Gump Usual Suspects and Interstellar.",NA
"fernandoschiavi","4 March 2023","Set in Los Angeles, the story brings a series of events where violence and the criminal underworld go hand in hand. Among the main stories told, we have gangsters Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and his partner Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and mob boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and his wife Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman). All the characters are somehow related. However, this is just a preface to the unbelievable plot that Tarantino develops.Once again, the filmmaker remakes, in his image, the referred resource of non-linear montage, something he had already outlined in his first film, but which, here, is part of the structural foundations of the narrative progression. We see some great unquestionable classics like ""Citizen Kane"", ""Rashomon"" and ""Annie Hall"" who have ventured down this path, with undeniable success, but with a very personal style of the director, but which was only really possible thanks, again, to the impeccable work of his late longtime partner Sally Menke in the editing room.See, for example, the time jump that Tarantino makes in the middle of the film, when we see little Butch (as an adult, the character played by Bruce Willis) receiving a visit from Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), who had lived with his father when the two were prisoners of war. This whole scene, which tells a story only with a long monologue by Koons in a unique long shot, which does not deviate from the character, aims to demonstrate to us the importance of Butch's father's watch. This happens right in the middle of the interrupted narrative that Tarantino imposes on us, but when the flashback happens, we accept it naturally, without being surprised or without even for a moment failing to understand what is happening. Today, we might find this obvious and unimaginative, but try to transport yourself to 1994, when Tarantino released Pulp Fiction at Cannes almost as an experimental work and received a standing ovation for long minutes, walking away with the Palme d'Or.The dialogue, in principle, is detached from the action: the henchmen discuss snacks and foot massages, this on the verge of forcibly collecting a debt. However, exactly in this opposition - followed by attraction - between speech and event, lies one of the greatest assets of ""Pulp Fiction"". The somewhat nonsensical staging of Tarantino, a filmmaker accustomed to mixing genres, giving them a pop look and giving the pastiche a paradoxical originality, embraces almost to perfection both the types given to verbiage before and after killing, and the subtexts that are not rancid and seasoned with irony.Who can forget the twist danced by Travolta and Uma Thurman, she, the wife of the mafia boss, that is, who he can't think of touching for fear of jealous reprisals? And what about the injection of adrenaline whose effect is to ""resurrect"" the same woman, rescuing her from the land of the dead by overdose? ""Pulp Fiction"" advances out of chronological order, packaged by, perhaps, the most expressive and functional soundtrack of Tarantino's career, composed of hits such as: You Never Can Tell, Girl You'll Be A Woman Soon, Son Of A Preacher Man, among others. In the scene in which Butch (Bruce Willis) listens to the plan to deliver a certain fight, for example, Let's Stay Together, a well-known romantic song, plays, here serving as a sonorous and, therefore, dramatic counterpoint to the dismayed face of the impotent boxer in the face of the cruelty of the world and his own weakness.Each of the narrative lines that populate this film in episodes of Tarantino is riddled with dialogues that function as an expansion of what we saw in his first work. While his first film had dialogues that were limited to the same circle of people composed of gangsters or bank robbers of Caucasian origin, in Pulp Fiction we see a profusion of different characters in a duo dynamic (or almost): the couple of amateur robbers who opens and closes the film (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer); assassin duo Vincent Vega (John Travolta, revived by Tarantino) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) on a mission; crime boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and boxer in the twilight of his career Butch (Willis) encountering rapists Zed (Peter Greene) and Maynard (Duane Whitaker); Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) dealing with a heroin overdose and drug dealer Lance (Eric Stoltz) and his wife Jody (Rosanna Arquette) and Vincent, Jules, Jimmie (Tarantino himself) and the ""resolver"" of problems"" Mr. Wolf (Harvey Keitel) dealing with a nasty situation involving blood and brains splattered in a car. Tight or semi-tight stories sewn together by a single theme in a film that tells them out of order, but brilliantly connects them.Each dialogue is carefully tailored to work with your character and the respective interaction with the other character. There's a bit of everything, in addition to Tarantino's incredible ability to insert pop culture mentions at every turn. The phrases about the small differences between Europe and the United States, about the ""medieval acts"" of Marsellus over Zed, about the quotation from the Bible that Jules uses before killing and several others are, if you like, as empty of content as they are full of meaning. Of rhythm; or as full of social criticism as we choose to imagine, but not forgetting that many of them are taken - some word for word - from previous works in yet another demonstration of Tarantino's ability to remix what already exists and transform it into something of his own. The result is entry of all of them and more into the general culture of moviegoers (who often don't even know they are quotes of quotes) and casual viewers alike. And all this married with a surgical choice of songs for each moment, each situation, in an anthological soundtrack, perhaps the best of its kind, in yet another amazing demonstration of musical curation by Tarantino.In ""Pulp Fiction"", Tarantino inserts quotes, dialogues and situations that bring direct relationships or allude to elements, mainly, of pop culture. Among the director's influences are Western films, as well as other noir films, such as ""Band à Part (1964)"", by Jean Luc Godard. This, in this case, inspired the dance of Uma Thurman and John Travolta. Other movie references are displayed when Butch chooses a weapon to return to the basement. The hammer is related to ""The Toolbox Murders (1978)"", the baseball bat in the best style of ""Walking Tall (1973)"" and ""The Untouchables (1987)"", the chainsaw to ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)"" and ""The Evil Dead II"" and, finally, the sword, the chosen weapon, makes analogy to several samurai films. In addition, the mixture of long dialogues with explicit violence makes the plot even more interesting, as well as the suspense created around the stories, which are gradually revealed. Still, some elements are fraught with uncertainty. This is the case with the suitcase of the mobster Marcellus. After all, what was in that briefcase? This is really a mystery, Tarantino himself said that its content is not of great importance, what matters is to whet the public's curiosity and give continuity to the plot. This type of resource is used in some audiovisual productions and is known as ""MacGuffin"", a term created by filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock.The more we unravel the timelines of the film, the more attached to the narrative we become. In this context, we observe the cycle between past and present, like the story of Butch and Captain Koons. Here, we follow Butch's troubled origins and draw a ""justification"" for his actions - not that this cancels out the character's responsibility, nor does it romanticize him. The question is, first of all, to understand the causes and consequences of the acts of the represented types, through acidic dialogues and remarkable flashbacks. After all, the construction of the figures is so careful that it is difficult to fully demonize or humanize the characters.In direction, Tarantino focuses excessively on the expressions of the figures that make up his work, turning the minimum into maximum detail. The actors' body language, for example, is extremely valued here, through frames that facilitate the connection with the audience. ""Pulp Fiction"" offers a true festival of unforgettable scenes. Perhaps most remembered is Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace's dance, but there's also Jules' speech before killing his targets, the talk of uncomfortable silences, the controversy over how sexual a foot massage is, and much more. The filmmaker uses and abuses symbols that strengthen his objective and, essentially, the development of the narrative, through an obscure, tense and challenging scenario. About the performances, it is valid to point out the incredible harmony between the cast. Interpreters of Mia and Vincent, and exhaling overwhelming chemistry, Uma Thurman - Oscar nominated for supporting role - and John Travolta steal the scene and masterfully defend their characters, raising the level of both to another level.Not behind his colleagues on the scene, Samuel L. Jackson - also nominated for an Oscar - stands out brilliantly with his Jules and turns him into the best performance in the film, being valued as he deserves. A golden trio.With a rare authorship and an easily identifiable style, Tarantino, already at the beginning of his career, consolidated himself as one of the main creative minds of his time and, although he was not the precursor of the tools he uses, the familiarity with which he travels through the various possibilities that the audiovisual offers make clear the reason for its outstanding position among peers. Remembering 'Pulp Fiction' as his best work is far from being a consensus, but it was a watershed for a successful trajectory and a milestone in the history of cinema.",NA
"davidmvining","25 November 2019","Much like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction works so well because of its structure. In Tarantino's freshman effort, he used the out of time elements to break up the one set monotony and provide lighter tonal moments here and there. In Pulp Fiction, it's used at the behest of thematic material, and I think it works on a whole different level.It's sort of an anthology film, but the three sections a little too interconnected to just lay it like that. They're connected through a similar set of characters that appear in, or are talked about, in all three, but also with the common theme of choice in the face of fate.In every story, from the dual framing devices (the café and the shootout over the suitcase) to the three main stories, characters are presented with inflection points in their lives, and they chose to go one way or another. Vincent Vega has come back to Los Angeles from several years as ""the man in Amsterdam"". One of his first tasks is to take his mob boss's wife, Mia Wallace, out for dinner, to provide her with company while her husband, Marsellus Wallace, is out of town. There's an connection between them that caps with them both dancing in a twist contest in the wonderfully grotesque nostalgia restaurant Jack Rabbit Slim's. Vincent refuses to take the next step, though. We're not quite sure if Mia would go to bed with Vincent (the way she talks about her husband demonstrates her fidelity towards him), but her willingness isn't the point. The point is Vincent's desire to make a move. He feels it's within the realm of possibility, but he refuses to take that step.Of course, he never really gets the chance because Mia has found Vincent's stash of heroin and snorted it, which was simply too much for her system and she began to overdose. This leads to the most famous scene in the movie where Vincent has to puncture Mia's breastplate with a six inch needle in Vincent's drug dealer's house. It's a great moment of tension with a fantastic shock.Taking a step back from that description of the first major third of the film, I think we can see in microcosm why Pulp Fiction works so well. We have fantastically written characters. We have an exploration of the central theme playing out dramatically. We have some spectacle in the form of the needle episode. It's a marvelous combination of entertainment, character work, and strong thematic material wrapped together extraordinarily well.The second third deals with Butch, a boxer we saw talking with Marsellus Wallace in the first. This also takes place after the third section. Butch has agreed to throw his fight, but he used the quasi-public knowledge of the agreement to cleanup on the odds and win big by winning the fight. He's prepped and ready to go, talking lightly with his girlfriend Fabienne as they spend the night in a hotel talking about the nature of attractiveness (really, her desire for a pot belly), and make fun of each other. He's set for life, and he knows it, but something's wrong. His father's watch is missing, left behind at the apartment. Christopher Walken actually started the story with a telling of the history of that watch (the famous ass watch scene), which he delivers wonderfully. It also sells the importance of the watch to Butch so that when he suddenly loses his cool and decides to brave what should surely be certain death to get it back, we get it. It makes sense. He has to go get it. There's no other choice. He goes back, gets it, gives Vincent a chest full of led from Vincent's own gun, and then accidentally happens across Marsellus Wallace as he drives away.There's fate again, presenting Butch with a situation where he has a choice. After a car crash and a limp-filled foot chase, the two end up trapped in the basement of two perverts (one a cop) who proceed to rape Wallace. Butch uses his opportunity to escape and has another choice. He could leave, scot free, or he could free Wallace. He does the right thing, grabs a samurai sword, and cuts down the perverts (and their gimp with a solid punch to the face). Wallace returns this favor by letting Butch go. They will break ties and have no more to do with each other.The third is where the thematic material comes out most and comes to the best conclusion. Even though it happens before the rest of the movie, the path that Jules follows and how he ends the film is the culmination of the ideas flowing through it. We pick back up with Vincent and Jules in the apartment with the briefcase. An unknown gunman jumps out and fires, emptying his gun in their direction but hitting nothing. After the darkly comic episode where they have to clean up brains from the back of their car, Vincent and Jules settle down in the café that started the film as Jules talks about their miraculous escape and how he plans on facing that with the rest of his life. Vincent considers it a freak accident, but Jules sees it as a sign from a higher power. He's been given an opportunity and a choice, and he's going to take a new path in response to it. He demonstrates that new path by allowing the robbers from the beginning of the film to leave with their lives.Thinking back over the rest of the movie, we realize the order of events as they played out chronologically and discover that Vincent died after the ending of the movie, at Butch's hands. If Jules had kept on his path without diverting it, ascribing the freak gun event as mere happenstance instead of a sign, Jules might have died there too. The universe reached out to both Vincent and Jules, and it was only Jules who read the sign correctly to run off to be like Caine from Kung Fu.So, sitting back, what is Pulp Fiction? First, it's a story that's told out of order chronologically but is arranged in a way that heightens its emotional and thematic impact. It's very well acted, filled with wonderful conversations between well-drawn and interesting characters. It's dotted with great moments of excitement, the kind you expect from a good time at the movies. It's an entire package of entertainment, thematic weight, and great characters.No wonder it made such a splash.",NA
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","25 March 2017","When Quentin Tarantino turned pulp fiction into cinematic art, everything changed. The auteur's second feature film marked the beginning of the rise of independent film in the '90s, but more importantly, it proved that the gratuitous sex, drugs, cursing and violence associated with ""low brow"" fiction could in fact be utilized intelligently for a higher artistic purpose. Essentially, ""Pulp Fiction"" proved that gratuitous genre films can be provocative and have something to say.""Pulp Fiction"" is three connected short stories sandwiched between a fourth story cut in half and used as a prologue and epilogue. The brilliance of Tarantino's screenplay (with story help from Roger Avary) comes not merely from this structure, but the way these three distinct acts tie together in unexpected, poignant ways. Act I, ""Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife,"" is the film's most memorable. The stylization, the quotable dialogue and Uma Thurman's tantalizing presence as Mia Wallace stand out as the film's hallmarks, even though when weighed on the whole, this act has the least to do with the weightier, more meaningful components of the film. It begins by introducing us to Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), two black tie hit men working for Wallace (Ving Rhames) who are on their way to interrogate some young men who appear to have stolen a valuable briefcase of Wallace's. En route, they discuss such asinine things as the level of intimacy in a foot massage and what a McDonald's quarter-pounder is called in Paris, firmly routing the story in what appears to be meaningless drivel. The feel echoes Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" in a lot of ways. We then follow Vega in a classic ""take out the boss's wife but don't lay a finger on her"" story filled with romantic tension that goes majorly awry.Act II, ""The Gold Watch,"" introduces us to aging boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) as Wallace asks him to throw an upcoming match. We also learn about Butch's father's lucky gold watch, a family heirloom with a crazy history. There's a noir aspect to this part of the story, as Butch of course decides not to throw the fight and run away with his girl (Maria de Madeiros), but the reckoning we expect takes a series of unbelievable turns. As we make sense of the chaos, notions of good vs. bad luck and good vs. evil — or bad vs. ****ing evil — start to appear, even as it plays for pulp entertainment.Act III, ""The Bonnie Situation,"" takes Jules and Vincent down a peg as they too get ""lucky"" but then must deal with a mistake that requires the help of a fixer named Wolf (Harvey Keitel). The whole ordeal has Jules contemplating the notion of divine intervention, and we begin to see all the events in the film as being either about luck, coincidence, divine intervention, or any other number of ways you can look at twists of fortune.By digging into the story and uncovering these deeper themes, Tarantino transforms everything else about the film from hollow pulp fiction to rich pulp fiction. He proves that meaning can come even from the perverted, salacious material. A notion of social responsibility even sneaks its way in by the end.As a director, Tarantino impressively wields suspense in the form of anticipated violence. It has remained his calling card ever since. Nobody can craft a modern day Mexican standoff like he seems to effortlessly do in every film. He also delivers on that anticipation of violence in a satisfying way. He goes big, but he never goes so far as to completely rip us out of this story.The greatest of great films always have unforgettable scenes that are somewhat inessential if not tangential to the story. Vincent and Mia twisting in the '50s-themed restaurant to Chuck Berry's ""You Never Can Tell;"" Christopher Walken's cameo relaying the story of the gold watch to a young Butch —Tarantino's creative choices really pop out, which happens when you've crafted an excellent story.Yet the literary quality that Tarantino brings to this curse-filled and violent film is it's crowning achievement. Even just the Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth) scenes that bookend the film have so much to say about fate and free will, and the things that happen to Vincent whenever he takes a bathroom break with a pulp magazine seem to offer a meta-commentary on the entertaining distraction typically associated with these kinds of genre films.""Pulp Fiction"" really tore down walls for filmmakers exposed to and inspired by pulp and other ""lesser"" forms of entertainment who wanted to grow up and make art. It certainly gave Tarantino an audience to keep telling these kinds of stories. From spaghetti westerns to kung fu movies, he finds a depth and richness to them and channels that into his own storytelling. ""Pulp Fiction"" happens to be his finest example as well as one of his first.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",NA
"z-07842","13 April 2020","It resonated so deeply on a level I couldn't explain at the time. Possibly it was the non-linear timeline of the plot, maybe it was the less-than-desirable content of the plot told in such an approachable way, maybe it was the easily memorable phrases and script or maybe it was the meticulously selected soundtrack that sourced from a host of decades and genresI think this was the first time I watched a movie that was so non linear. I think everything I had watched before this went from A to B with possibly a flashback explaining something. This changed everything!! After this we had great movies like The Usual Suspects and Monento. But it is not just the structure to Pulp Fiction that makes it great, it does not put a foot wrong.",NA
"cosmogirl_185","5 July 2009","I've seen Pulp Fiction many times and i love it more and more every time i watch it. The content of the film is truly unique for its time. The plot has dimension which makes you notice something new every time. Characters are wonderfully developed and are believable. There's plenty of drama, a good amount of action, and a few laughs that lighten the mood of the film. the script is well written, dialog among the actors is amazingly natural and realistic. the story is not hard to follow unlike some films similar to this one, and offers an interesting presentation considering scenes are not in the standard chronological order. I would recommend this movie to anyone viewing this page unless drug use and violence offends you. Pulp fiction is a must see for action movie lovers, and great movie to enjoy on an evening in.",NA
"adampnsh5","16 February 2011","As with most Tarantino movies, each time you watch it it seems a bit different. Now, I don't't think that it's the best movie ever and I don't think that everybody has to like it, because it can easily be disliked. What I don't understand is this- Why does this film have such a bad reputation. Just think this over, please, all of you people who wail and complain about how horribly violent it is.How on earth are you so isolated as to think that this is the most violent movie out there? Have you not seen any movies since 1994? Because believe me, this movie could practically slide by with a PG-13 today (well not really) But honestly, if you don't like the move, then sure, fine, you don't like it, but why would you attack it's content when there are so many other movies that are MUCH more violent?",NA
"jay4stein79-1","22 November 2004","Have you ever gone from one extreme to the other on an issue? Our President excluded, many of us change our minds about things on a daily basis. When it comes to philosophies or preferences, we're not static creatures because we realize obstinance is not a virtue. We change, we evolve - that is to be human.Well, my opinion of Pulp Fiction has underwent several cataclysmic upheavals since I first saw the film in its year of release, 1994. I was 14 and, without exaggerating, Pulp Fiction shattered my concept of film. I'd never been so excited, intrigued and in love with a film. It forced me to reconsider what quality cinema was - it was no longer just the greats, the Best Picture winners, etc. Great cinema could be anything - old gangster movies, film noir, B-horror flicks, 1950s melodrama. The film also prompted me to explore film on a more academic basis, as I began reading film theory and film criticism regularly.I worshiped at the shrine of Tarantino and watched everything he put his hands on - be that Destiny Turns on the Radio or 4 Rooms.His other work (even Reservoir Dogs, which, I am convinced, is nothing more than a decent first film) disappointed me, but I never once second-guessed Pulp Fiction. Jackie Brown in 1997 re-affirmed my faith in the man, but then he disappeared and a funny thing happened, I second guessed Pulp Fiction.The dialogue, which I once thought brilliant, was not stilted and forced - a little too hip for its own good. The acting was all right, but seemed weaker than I remembered, and the once brilliant story became trite. The masterpiece became, in my eyes, pretentious, though still watchable fare. On my list of 100 favorite films, it fell from the top-10 to the upper 70s.Years went by, I continually found myself drawn to Jackie Brown (I think it's Tarantino's most mature wok and a wrongfully maligned masterpiece), but I avoided Pulp Fiction. A friend who had never seen the film asked one day if we could throw my copy on and it was like watching it for the first time.Everything that seemed forced or trite was brilliant. The dialogue that seemed overly stylized now seemed perfectly stylized and, really, perfectly at odds with the plot, which, though it contains recycled elements, became an energetic, hyper-kinetic, and amazing narrative again.Pulp Fiction quickly returned to the top of my favorites list. Why the swift rising and falling? I have no idea. It could be that QT created a film that is so tied to its audience's state of mind that their reaction to it is a complete crap shoot for him. That's doubtful. What I think truly happened is this: my adolescent mind reacted to its pop-culture references and its manic pace. It was hip and cool, really, and therefore perfect for your alterna teenagers. I matured, grew disdainful of things hip and cool (it was obviously cooler to dislike things that were cool right?), and so began disliking PF. I grew up a little more, became a little more perceptive, and therefore able to appreciate exactly what QT does with narrative and dialogue. Pulp Fiction, though this may seem odd, is a very subtle movie. Its brilliance at first seems superficial, but dig a little deeper and you'll find a film that is narratively amazing and that carries emotional weight. It's not all style; it's not just hip. It's an intelligent and wonderful movie and I don't think that I'll change my mind on it again.",NA
