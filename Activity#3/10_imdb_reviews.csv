"Smells_Like_Cheese","29 June 2006","Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio! 10/10","

"MadReviewer","16 April 2001","A sprawling Western epic that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold, Sergio Leone's `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is a masterpiece, one that continues to get better and better with each viewing.  In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner.  Sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. This film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne `White Hat/Black Hat' Western.The three main characters make the film.  Lee Van Cleef (`The Bad') is evil personified.  Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants.  Clint Eastwood (`The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really `good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing.  (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.)  Eli Wallach (`The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film.  All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents `the ugly' side of people.The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film.  Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on.  The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable.  Any typical Western cliché that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling.  Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect.  Two scenes - one in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score. This movie is absolutely brilliant.  If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge to do so.  Immediately.  (And then, go watch `Unforgiven' . . . in a way, I think that `Unforgiven' is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.) `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is easily one of the best Westerns ever made.

"Quinoa1984","1 January 2004","...and though those last several words could also be attributed to Leone's ""Once Upon a Time"" films (West and America) as well as the other pieces in his trilogy of films with Clint Eastwood- Fistful of Dollars and For a Few More Dollars- arguably this is the most ambitious and spellbinding one of the bunch, and one that has inspired (i.e. Quentin Tarantino, Sam Raimi, Robert Rodriguez) and will most likely continue to inspire filmmakers and fans into the 21st century. There's something in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly that's nearly (or perhaps is) mythical in it's craft, certain scenes come off as being more than relevant and exquisite for that scene/sequence- it transcends into aspects of humanity.For example, in the first part of the film (this is after the extraordinary introductions to Tuco, played by Eli Wallach, Sentenza or 'Angel Eyes', played by Lee Van Cleef, and as Blondie by a 35/36 year old Clint), Joe gets Tuco out of a hanging, which is something of a regular practice for them, but Joe decides to leave his 'buddy' out in the desert to walk the rest of the way back into town. A little later, the situation gets reversed, as Tuco has a horse and water and Joe doesn't, and they both go to cross the desert. Leone decides to not follow Tuco coming back to town as much as he follows in earnest Tuco and Joe going across that desert, as Joe starts to burn and dry up, going towards a story that will soon unfold. There is something to these scenes that I can barely describe, that they're executed in the mind-set of a Western, but in the abstract Leone lets the audience know this is a story that is bold and bigger than life.What makes much of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly such a huge success is the trust Leone had in his own style he spun into his own after the first two westerns, his trust in his collaborators, and in his leading players as well. I, for one, had to mistakenly figure out that it is near depressing to watch this film on a regular VCR tape due to the pan & scan process. There is such a clear, distinct visual scope that Leone and camera director Tonino Delli Colli achieve that it's practically a must to get the DVD (preferably the extended version, which was Leone's original cut more or less). The editing, too, is unique in many sequences (the climax is the most noted and memorable). The score, with usual collaborator Ennio Morricone, is one of the landmark movie scores, and themes, of not just in the western genre but in all movie history. And the three main players who take on the screen have their own chops to show off: Eastwood, technically, was playing a Joe that took place before Fistful of Dollars, yet by this film had it down to a T (it's still my favorite performance from him, despite having few words and reactions); Cleef's cold, cunning Angel Eyes steals the scenes he's in; ditto for Wallach, who gets under the skin of his co-patriots as much as he sometimes does under the viewer's. If anyone really stays in the mind, at least for me, it's Wallach - especially as he gets the most 'character', and one of the very best scenes is between Tuco and his religious brother. Without that scene, the movie actually wouldn't work quite as well, surprisingly enough. Overall, The Good, the Bad and Ugly, is an entirely satisfying western, at least one of my five favorites ever made, and it's an endearing bravo to all who were involved.","

"Steffi_P","25 November 2006","Sergio Leone always wanted every picture he made to be, in every way, bigger than the one which preceded it. With the Good, the Bad and the Ugly he continued his upward trajectory and rounded off his dollars trilogy in style.This picture was Leone's most stylised and grandiose to date, and brought all the themes and styles he had been developing in his earliest films to perfection. Among the most notable was his characterisation, particularly his all-important introductions of characters. Look at the introductory scenes of the three leads. We first see Tuco bursting out of a window, obviously interrupted in the middle of a meal, and straight away we get his freeze-frame and the title ""the ugly""  this is a simple character, and needs no further introduction. Angeleyes appears out of the distance, but grows towards us until his face fills the screen. We see him commit two despicable acts of murder and treachery before we get his freeze-frame and title ""the bad"", telling us he is pure evil. Finally, in Blondie's first appearance he steps into the frame from behind the camera, as if he had always been there. He rescues Tuco, but only for his own profit. It's not until we have seen him betray and abandon Tuco that we get his freeze-frame and title ""the good""  obviously a fairly ironic label given the way he has just acted.Leone's trademark long drawn out face-offs  exaggerated versions of the shootouts of John Ford westerns and the sword duels of Kurosawa's samurai films  are also brought to a peak here. Not only are they now taken to absurd heights of stylisation, they are also spread out and adapted to cover the whole picture, until the point where even two men sitting opposite each other eating a meal and glancing suspiciously at one another is treated like another stand off. In fact, the entire film can be considered one long series of duels.We also see more of the importance Leone attaches to church and family. The Dollars trilogy could be thought to lack emotion, taking place as it does in a world where there are no morals and everyone is out for gold. However the Good, the Bad and the Ugly contains several moments of poignancy, perhaps the most prominent of which is when Tuco confronts his estranged priest brother.Religious iconography and references crops up time and again. Leone loved biblical epics almost as much as he loved westerns, and there is something of the feel of those pictures here in the overwhelming landscapes and eerie, choral music. On top of this the central trio can be read as an allegory for God, the Devil and humanity. This arguably presents rather a cynical view of the Catholic faith  given the treacherous and chequered nature of the ""good""  but it could be argued to be a typically Italian one. In a country in which the church is so omnipresent and universally accepted, it's sometimes said that God is cursed as much as loved. Having said that, this was clearly never intended as the central theme  Leone wasn't trying to make some grand statement here  it's simply part of the mix of ideas going on in this picture.This brings me onto the war theme. Anti-war sentiments are not directly addressed in this picture, but the way the civil war is woven into the plot makes a powerful statement. For the first half hour we don't see that the war is going on. The central characters aren't concerned with the it  they are only interested in hunting down the gold. However the war encroaches on the plot more and more often, until it moves from background to foreground and takes over the entire picture, culminating in a colossal battle scene. And of course the fact that the film ends in a huge military graveyard is also very significant.I've spent so long talking about the themes and ideas going on in this film I've nearly run out of space to talk about all the genius that has gone into making it so enjoyable. The dialogue is superb, often funny and plenty of it quotable. Technically Leone has perfected his art  he composes a shot like John Ford, edits like Eisenstein, paces like Kurosawa, but all with a degree of his own originality. There is brilliant acting  Eli Wallach steals it as Tuco, probably his best ever performance. It's funny how Lee Van Cleef was cast as a villain here. Van Cleef's early career mostly involved playing mean-looking gang members, but as Leone discovered when casting him as the hero in For a Few Dollars More, while his face said ""bad guy"" his voice and manner could be warm and likable. The good guy Van Cleef obviously proved more popular, as in the dozen or so other spaghetti westerns he made for other directors he was invariably cast as the hero.Just time for a final word on the recent (2003) restored edition. While it's great that several lost scenes have been added, I have to say that very few of them were entirely necessary. The only one of the added scenes I really like is the one in which Angeleyes visits the field hospital  it keeps his story arc going, and also shows an act of compassion from the ""bad"" when he lets the soldier keep the bottle. However the new dubbing for these scenes, strange as it may seem considering today's technology, is mixed absolutely atrociously. On top of this, Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are now so elderly, they actually sound less convincing than the guy impersonating the late Lee Van Cleef. As a result the restored segments stick out like sore thumbs, and break up the flow of what is in every other way a perfect motion picture.","

"murtaza_mma","19 February 2009","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly or the Good, the Better and the Best, as I prefer calling it, is a bizarrely sublime and a uniquely aesthetic masterpiece. The actors in title roles have given such extraordinarily superb performances, that it would be impertinent and disparaging to merely regard their swell work as acting. In fact their brilliant portrayals have immortalized Blondie, Sentenza/ Angel Eyes and the enigmatic Tuco. Lee Van Cleef is fiendishly unforgiving as the merciless Angel Eyes. Clint Eastwood is rugged yet suave, cocky yet adorable as laconic cigar-smoker Blondie, a role that laid the foundations of his illustrious career. But it is Eli Wallach, who steals the show with his captivating portrayal of Tuco, a portrayal that is as entrancing as it is enlightening. Wallach is amusing, capricious, nonchalant, uncanny and yet tenacious as Tuco, perturbed by his insecurities and dampened by his solitude. It is the tacit amicability between Blondie and Tuco and their mutual hostility towards the evil Angel Eyes owing to the vestiges of virtue present in them, redolent of their moribund morality, which gives the story, the impetus and the characters, a screen presence that is not only awe inspiring but also unparalleled.Sergio Leone's magnificent and ingenious direction in synergy with Ennio Morricone's surreal music, Tonino Delli Colli's breathtaking cinematography and Joe D'Augustine's punctilious editing makes the movie, a treat to watch and ineffably unforgettable. Initially aimed to be a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, continues to stand the test of time in its endeavor to attain apotheosis (if it hasn't attained it yet). It will always be remembered as European cinema's greatest lagniappe, not only to the Western genre, but to the world of cinema.It's a must watch for any movie lover. 10/10","

"spider89119","24 August 2005","I wasn't sure if I was going to comment on this film because everything has already been said by the hundreds of other people who have posted their thoughts, but I decided that I should really put my two cents in since this is my favorite movie.This film, in my opinion, is not only the greatest spaghetti western of all time. It is the greatest movie of all time. Period. Regardless of genre. I could probably watch it every day, and be perfectly happy doing so.The music is perfection. The way the music drives this movie is absolutely amazing. The musical genius of Morricone and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone is a combination that will probably never be equaled. The theme song will forever be etched in your brain. In fact, it probably already is, even if you haven't seen the movie! The scene where Tuco runs through the graveyard with the song ""Ecstacy of Gold"" is pure poetry. And the showdown at the end with that great music- just incredible.The story is riveting. There is not a single dull moment. The movie is long, but Leone's direction is so good that you will love the fact that you can enjoy this movie for three hours.Lee Van Cleef is my favorite spaghetti western actor, and he is incredible as ""Angel Eyes."" It is the part he was born to play. Eli Wallach is perfect as Tuco. He really shines in this movie. Some people say he steals the show, and I can see why they think so. Eastwood is excellent as ""Blondie,"" although I don't think Eastwood has as strong of a presence as Van Cleef (I know many will disagree, and that's OK because all three actors are superb in this film so why split hairs?).This movie is hypnotic. It's operatic. It's sad. It's funny. It's gritty. It's violent. It's art. It's action. It's pure entertainment. The film is just so incredible on so many different levels that EVERYONE should see it, regardless of what kinds of movies they are into. And it's so cool that the greatest flick ever just happens to be a spaghetti western. If you haven't seen this movie, stop what you are doing, and go get it now!!","

"gogoschka-1","11 February 2018","I'll keep this brief: This is simply one of the most entertaining and best looking westerns ever. Director Sergio Leone's unique use of the camera - long, uninterrupted shots in wide angle alternating with extreme close-ups - and Ennio Morricone's unique, wildly inventive soundtrack are blended to perfection. The career-making performances by Eli Wallach (hilarious), Lee Van Cleef (chilling) and Clint Eastwood (cool) are nothing short of iconic, and the film's finale is so good it will send shivers of cinematic joy down your spine. It's a movie of epic proportions; it's funny and violent, but underneath it all there is a strong anti-war message. It's a cinematic masterpiece and one of the most influential movies of all time. Oh, and it's also tons of fun, and you should see it on the biggest screen possible. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/","

"perica-43151","20 July 2018","Filmed in Spain by Italian filmmaker, this is the best Western ever made. With Hollywood actors but fittingly, not made in Hollywood, it was despised by the mainstream at the time, but also recognized for its genius and is the most famous part of the most famous Western trilogy. Building on a rich Italian storytelling and film making tradition, with unforgettable score, this movie has justly taken the place it now holds. If you have not seen it yet, do it. Equally subversive and authentic, this is just one master piece nobody should miss.","

"dr_foreman","21 August 2006","On a partial first viewing, I didn't like ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" I thought it was a slow, tedious story about a bunch of unpleasant jerk characters involved in a bog-standard conflict over money. It all seemed very macho and self-consciously cool, and it had obviously inspired all the overrated macho directors I don't like in my own generation - Tarantino, for example, and Robert Rodriguez. In short, I was unimpressed.Years later, I gave the film a second shot, watching it all the way through this time. I loved it. What had changed? For one thing, I took more notice of the technical side of the film. I paid attention to Leone's famous use of close-ups, his selection of memorable character actors, and his wonderful scene-setting. I admired the detailed sets and the sweeping landscapes, the props and the costumes and all those weird, wonderful faces that Leone clearly loved to photograph.I also got hooked by some of the quieter moments that I had skipped over in my first viewing. One of the most effective scenes involves Eli Wallach's character, Tuco, quarreling with his brother when they meet after they've been apart for years. Their argument is great, emotionally charged stuff, made all the more effective by the suggestion that they really do love and care about each other. It's the kind of sensitive, human scene you never get to see in a Tarantino or Rodriguez movie.Before I get too fuzzy-wuzzy, I should also like to point out that, on my second viewing, I LOVED all the action, too. Every gunfight is great, in its own way, and they're all a bit different. The greatest of them all is, of course, the final confrontation between the trio, which is accompanied by some of the most rousing music I've ever heard in a film. And hey, there's even a huge Civil War battle to provide a change of pace from all the small-scale action.Ultimately, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is probably just a potboiler of a film, without too much to say about, for example, the human condition. But what a potboiler! It doesn't have to try to be cool - it simply IS cool. In fact, it probably defined heroic coolness for an entire generation. Eli Wallach's performance, Leone's direction and Morricone's music alone are enough to elevate it to classic status - and the fact that everything else in the movie is great, too, helps elevate it to the level of perhaps the greatest action film ever made.And to think, I missed all that the first time through...","

"EVON1TY","2 March 2023","I wasn't aware of the wild taste of Western. This movie made me love Western. I don't know any movie can achieve being this much effective nearly without any drama. Nearly every great movie is carried by some drama between characters.Yes it has a little bit drama. It shows the greediness of humanity just like The Treasue of Sierra Madre. It refletcs conflicts between three different types of men. Also I love how Eastwood's character is nameless in The Man Without Name Trilogy. Sometimes the trilogy also called The Dollar Trilogy.Besides the storyline the techincs are breathtaking.Acting performances are just breathtaking. If you didn't notice that much of acting skills, then you should check Trivias of the movie.The Scores just one of the bests. Morricone just made the most iconic scores. From that time until now, every Western score has his iconic type.Set decoration is about something enormous in this movie. They really did something great with that too.Costume design and makeups are also so good. You can see it in the battle scenes and in the desert scenes.Sound is really good, the only decent thing is Film Editing. Especially in the Extended Versions some flaws appears.","

"steven-f-freeman","26 December 2007","After many years of barely watching any movies, I treated myself to several classics recently. And this was the best.That I so enjoyed this movie so much came as a shock to me. I literally never before have been able to even sit through a western, which (in my admittedly limited experience) was schlock action starring John Wayne as the taciturn all-American good guy being tough and beating up the outlaws. Watching GBU, I was enthralled for the entire three hours. Twice. And if I had time, I would have watched it a third time. The setting is typically western: a dry, dusty panorama in which men barely co-exist with each other; few wasted words; and lots of action, horses, and gunfighting in a wild west barely governed by incipient institutions of law & order  all shrouded within a morality play of good vs. bad. But what I liked so much is exactly what I hate about John Wayne westerns  the seriousness and honesty with which moral context is considered. In Hollywood, good vs. bad is as thoughtlessly superscripted as the protagonists' white and black hats. In GBU every remnant of moralizing has been ruthlessly cut.Good, Bad, and Ugly are personified in the form of three characters: Bad (""Sentenza"") is the easiest to understand. He is *very* bad, perhaps not so different from other villains, but much more sharply developed; murderous, sadistic, traitorous, and remorseless. Good (""Blondie"") and Ugly (""Tuco"") are more puzzling, but their labels are the key to the movie. Both Blondie and Tuco are outlaws and killers with only the barest hint of morality, but they're not evil in the same way that Sentenza is. Tuco is demonstrative, emotional, loud, wild, and unpredictable; but driven by survival rather than satanic urges. Blondie is cool, calm, rational and controlled  in many ways similar to Sentenza  but whereas Sentenza tortures, maims, kills, and lies for the hell of it, even apparently enjoys it, Blondie simply goes about his business coolly, and shows several poignant hints of empathy, decency, and a sense of justice.GBU takes place during the Civil War and strips away the high-level political struggle of history books, leaving us with the soldier's vantage point of brutality, pointless death, and some individual decency. The politics are indecipherable from this vantage point. GBU hits this point home when our protagonists wind up in a prison camp because the oncoming gray cavalry uniforms turn out to be dust-covered blue. Later, they encounter an army fighting over a worthless bridge, suffering countless pointless deaths and casualties. Because Leone has so rigorously excised traditional off-the-shelf morality, the few instances of humanity are remarkably poignant. One such instance is when Blondie shares his coat and cigar with a dying soldier; another is when prisoners are forced  by Sentenza's orders  to play music to cover up the screams of the tortured. Sentenza apparently enjoyed the irony of beautiful sounds used for such ends; the musicians are, of course, pained by it.That was one of many extraordinarily striking scenes. The honesty of the moral context was what I liked best about the film, but I liked everything else too. Indeed the same primal, ruthless honesty that characterizes the character development pervades the film. The music is unlike anything I'd ever heard  it's an audible version of the arid west and the tensions and lawlessness that characterize the film. Underlying the entire score is one instantly memorable theme starting off with what sounds like a screaming hyena. The story took place in New Mexico, and even though it was filmed in Spain, it really does look like New Mexico; and just as in life in the American west, the wide, breathtaking panorama tends to subordinates dialog. Indeed, it is several minutes into the film before even one word is spoken.The plot was extremely clever  and never predictable. High level suspense is maintained for the full three hours. It was hard to imagine how it could unfold  three uncompromising outlaws in search of one buried treasure; cooperation was not in their nature, but nothing was ever done out of character. Any Western cliché that you can think of is either given a unique twist or destroyed by masterful storytelling. For example there is an utterly irreverent scene in which Tuco meets his brother, a sincere Priest, and turns platitudes upside down. The brother begins with the standard rebuke of the criminal's behavior, but Tuco punches back and says, ""Where we come from there were only two ways out. You lacked the courage to do what I've done."" The movie is also irreverently funny: For example, Twice Tuco gained the upper hand on Blondie and said:""There are two kinds of spurs(?), my friend. Those that come in by the door, and (crosses himself) those that come in by the window.""""There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who have a rope around their neck and those who have the job of cutting."" Later Blondie gained the advantage of Tuco and observed: ""You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend - those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig."" In addition to all these specific attributes, a unique and strikingly cool style infuses the entire film: long scenes of tense silences  never for an instant boring; and telling, startling close-ups and transitions. Most noteworthy was the film's climax. As the protagonists stand there with their fingers on their holsters, waiting for the first person to go for their gun(s), the transitions start out slowly, and speed up as the tension increases. As I write this, I wish I had my own copy of the film, just so I could see this scene again.Not just a great western, but easily one of the best movies of *any* kind ever made.","

"A_Different_Drummer","9 September 2016","One of the original Leone ""Italian Westerns"" that quickened the pulse of a young Quentin Tarantino.Sometimes I think I am living in a time warp. I watched all the Leone films in theatres in real time and was mesmerized, gob-smacked, and exhilarated. Now in the far future (2016) I watch QT do his knock-offs, and the young audiences (who have never seen the originals) think his are the originals, and everything else the knockoffs.(Reminds me of the Old King Cole nursery rhyme -- ""pulled out a plum and said What a Good Boy Am I"" -- another reference lost on those living the age of portable devices.) For those who actually care about the history of film: * Leone invented a brand new genre called the Italian western. His first, Fistful of Dollars, recycled a Japanese story (Yojimbo), recycled an American ex-pat whose Hollywood career was officially over (Eastwood) and introduced one of the greatest music composers of the modern film era, Ennio Morricone.* next came For a Few Dollars More, an original story, which locked into film history Leone's trademark use of closeups and sound editing, and brought out of mothballs Lee Van Cleef, one of the greatest ""faces"" in the history of the western. (""Angel Eyes"" in this one.) * with two international hits under his belt, Leone aimed for the stars and created this movie which marks his legacy. While simultaneously continuing the tradition he started, and using the two stars from his second film, he gave Eli Wallach (an A-list star from the 1950s) the role of his career. Wait there is more. He set the story against the backdrop of the Civil War and manged to make the transitions seamless and brutally compelling. it is simultaneously a violent film and an anti-war film at the same time! (The only film of Leone's that may compete with this one is Once Upon a Time in America, also reviewed by this writer on the IMDb).By modern standards the film is overlong and, had it been produced in America (as was indeed the case with Upon a Time in America), the ""suits"" would have butchered it down to 100 minutes. Luckily for the rest of us, this was an international release, cut-proof, and survives very nicely to the present day in its original form.QT was a young lad when these films appeared but the impact is clear. He used Morricone's music in Kill Bill (his best film in my view) and in my view The Hateful Eight tries to emulate the power of Leone but falls somewhat short.For you youngsters out there, I recommend these films as some of the most entertaining efforts ever set to film, period. Imitated but not duplicated.Astonishing, mind-blowing, unforgettable.","

From when the dust clears after the bridge blows, the movie develops a momentum that doesn't let up until the very last shot.The dying soldier; Tuco being blasted from the horse and crashing into the gravestone; Tuco running round and round the graveyard (how was that shot?); the way the three protagonists come together; the shootout; Tuco and Blondie playing out their last confrontation; and then a final wail,the guitars come in one more time and Clint just rides hell for leather out across the desert.It's cliché to say ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" but not only don't ""they"", ""they"" wouldn't have a clue how to make a movie like this any more.","

"MovieAddict2016","3 October 2003","Sergio Leone is arguably the most visionary director of all time. They say that before he even had a written script he could picture exactly what was to be on screen and the camera's direction in leading his characters. It was Sergio's World - an alternate place in an alternate time that he was free to control. He controlled the audience and his story like no other director.To me, his best film was the one that was on many critics' ten worst films of 1984 list: ""Once Upon a Time in America."" I love the finished director's cut, the cut of the film Sergio Leone himself wanted and pictured in his mind while filming the movie. Unfortunately, the editor of the film cut everything into a two-hour picture and messed up the timeline for the theatrical release in 1984 - the result was a disastrous motion picture that now, with the director's cut, stands as one of the best of all time. James Woods once said that one of the critics who named it the worst film of 1984 later named it the best film of the decade.""Once Upon a Time in America"" was Sergio's dream project, one that took him ten years to get on the big screen and ultimately killed him by sucking the life out of him, but ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1967) was undoubtably his most visual film. The extreme close-ups, the great way he lets the audience see nothing but what he wants - as far as he saw it, the audience should not wonder what is off-screen; whatever is within the frames is all there is. Compared to ""Once Upon a Time"" it seems a bit more corny and unrealistic - but it is a spaghetti western, and that is simply the point. It stands above the rest as the best spaghetti western of them all.Leone is best remembered for his extreme close-ups. Director Quentin Tarantino once said, among many other things about Leone, his role model, that when he started out he knew not many camera directions, so when he wanted an extreme close-up in a film he'd shout, ""I want a Sergio Leone on this guy!"" Quentin Tarantino has such a respect for Leone that he even suggested the title ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" to director Robert Rodriguez, the title, of course, a derivation on ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and ""Once Upon a Time in America,"" both films of Sergio Leone.""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" a.k.a. ""Buono, il bruto, il cattivo, il,"" is the final film in the Dollars Trilogy - ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" ""For a Few Dollars More,"" and, of course, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" I have yet to see this film's predecessors, but I doubt they are much better than this film. It isn't really about anything per se - it's a showcase of art and camera techniques. It is a showcase for Sergio Leone and a great one at that. I have no real care about the themes or outcomes - I simply enjoy being controlled by a masterful director such as Leone. When there's a director who can literally push in and give the audience specifically what he wants them to see, without the audience feeling cheated, you know you have a great director, because there's a fine line between a selfish director and a visionary director. Leone has a bit of both, so indistinct that it is hard to notice. The same thing was done in Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"" (1949), and the same is done here. And it is pulled off without any objections from the audience.Clint Eastwood is The Good - he rides around the desert kidnapping criminals, giving them to the authorities and claiming reward money, and then freeing the criminals before they are to be hanged. He meets Tuco (Eli Wallach), a.k.a. The Ugly, and does his routine - but The Ugly fights back and, ultimately, kidnaps good ol' Clint, taking him into the desert and practically torturing him in the heat.Then The Good overhears where a stash of gold is hidden from a dying man. The Ugly wants the gold so much that he nurses The Good back to health so that they can go off on a wild goose chase and search for the treasure. But there is already another man searching for the treasure - Angel Eyes, a.k.a. The Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a man whose skills at gunfighting match those of The Good, a true marksman if ever there was such a thing.There's a terrific scene towards the end of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" where three men have found the gold buried in a graveyard. At exactly the same time. They each have guns pointed at each other. They could all pull their triggers and die, or kill one of the three and the two could then take the money and split it. Leone zooms in with his extreme close-ups and truly gives the audience a sense of paranoia, a sense of what it would feel like in a circumstance such as that. Sergio Leone is a great director, perhaps the most visionary of all time, and now that his films are turning up again with their intended running times, the realization strikes and sinks in.He's an even better director than we thought he was.5/5 stars -John Ulmer","

"Dolf","6 January 1999","This is without a doubt my all-time favorite western.The beginning of the film is so memorable, with the young, rough good-looks of Eastwood being labeled ""The Good"", the absolutely evil look of Lee Van Cleef being labeled ""The Bad"", and a dirty, unkempt, desperado Eli Wallach with booze and food flying being labeled ""The Ugly"".  The ending fight scene with its 3-way showdown is one of the most memorable pieces of film I have ever watched.Leone did a great job with the camera direction in this movie and the acting is impressive.  Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach are absolutely fantastic.The only thing that might scare some viewers off is the length of the film. It is long, but you just don't seem to notice it when you are watching the film - you are just too damn busy watching the best classic western of all time.Do yourself a favor and rent this movie if you haven't seen it.  If there was ever a perfect western, this is it.","

"a_southern_knight","16 August 2004","This is the third,and arguably the best, of the so-called ""spaghetti western"" trilogy. It is ironic that, at the time the three Sergio Leone westerns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being poor and even laughable imitations of American-made westerns. The fact that they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.Somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the critics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are generally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood was principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the television series ""Rawhide"" when the films were produced but since then has achieved superstardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I believe the critics decided to take another look at these films and realized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually, I believe the three films were considerably better than most of what Hollywood produced. In fact, I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best westerns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John Ford, the undisputed master of that genre, and his protege, the incomparable John Wayne. I have nothing but praise for this film. In fact, I rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good about this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in other viewer reviews, I will focus on what others didn't like about it. Most of the IMDb reviews had only one major complaint: the film is too long. I disagree. In fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, I was disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I was disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of story, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be desired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag on in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create moods and to drive home important points. For example, the opening sequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a hapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me, scenes like that are what makes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate the amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of its dirt-poor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the table; I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of the meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the inevitable climax. You know it's coming but not when and the length of the scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it does happen. Another example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk through the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might become bored with the film. But again, I think the time for the scene was justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that experience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joe's subsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this sequence been abbreviated. In my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is creating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time, lots of time. For example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film ""Dr. Zhivago"" were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create those startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been great without them. In many ways, TGTBATU has this same sort of greatness. It is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and magnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesn't release him until the closing credits begin to roll. When it's over, you feel that you've been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.In summary, if you haven't seen this film, buy it right away. Don't rent it because you will not want to part with it once you've seen it.Then curl up with it on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon when you are in no hurry to do anything.","

"bensonmum2","2 July 2006","I know some movie fans who consider The Good, the Bad and the Ugly the best movie ever made. While I don't even think it's the best thing Sergio Leone made, it's a solid Spaghetti Western that has all but transcended the sub-genre. There are images, such as Clint Eastwood in the poncho, and music, like the main title theme, that are known by people who have never seen the movie. I also know people who wouldn't be caught dead watching a movie made outside of the USA who love The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. I can't think of another Italian made film, let alone an Italian made Western, that has become so universally known and enjoyed.There are so many moments in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly that I enjoy. One of my favorites is that of Tuco running through the cemetery as Morricone's ""The Ecstasy of Gold"" plays in the background. It literally gives me goosebumps. It's one of those movie moments that I look forward to no matter how many times I've seen them. I'm also a fan of the techniques Leone used in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Leone's use of the widescreen shots of the landscape inter-cut with extreme close-ups of faces is brilliant. It adds a sense of intimacy to vastness of the setting that allows the viewer feel like they're part the movie and gain some insight into the characters. It's a technique that very few other filmmakers have the guts to employ.But I sincerely doubt that Leone's film would be so widely and wildly regarded if it weren't for the music of Ennio Morricone. I've already mentioned the main title theme and ""The Ecstasy of Gold"", but these are only two examples found in this amazing score. Can you imagine the final showdown without Morricone's music? I can't think of many instances where music and film go together to create such tension and anticipation. I've already used the word ""brilliant"" to describe Leone, but it's also applicable to Morricone.Finally, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly wouldn't be the same without the three lead actors. Each, at least in this movie, is brilliant (there's that word again) in his own right. Clint Eastwood is ""The Good"". He's ""The Good"" in the sense that he's not as ""bad"" as the other two. Lee Van Cleef is ""The Bad"". He's a ruthless killer who would just as soon shoot you as look at you - as long as the price was right. And then there's Eli Wallach as ""The Ugly"". As good as Eastwood and Van Cleef are, Wallach is really something special. Wallach's Tuco is one of the most crazed, but complicated characters I've seen. It's a special cast for a very special movie.","

"Nazi_Fighter_David","12 May 2000","Sergio Leone's film follows the adventures of 3 ruthless outlaws...The 'Good' is Eastwood's unchanging and unshaven 'Stranger With No Name.' An unprincipled killer who stands only for his 45... He is quiet, inexpressive and cool, only seen once with a brief moment of humanity where his classic disinterest contrasts with the real tragedy of the American Civil War...The 'Bad' is an excellent supporting actor, a Western figure... With his long, thin opening eyes, deathly pale face and cruel voice, Lee Van Cleef is the merciless bounty hunter, ironically called 'Angel Eyes,' always ready to kill for a price...The 'Ugly' is Eli Wallach, a wild spirit with devil attitude... Tuco is charming but extremely dangerous...The pairing of Eastwood and Wallach is memorable for its black humor alternating each other's fate, motivated satisfactorily by their excessive desire for collecting the reward money... The quest: a treasure chest containing $200,000 in gold buried in a Confederate grave in Sad Hill Cemetery...""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" had many haunting moments: Complicated bounty-hunter's con-games; the Stranger, in a frantic hurry, trying to load his empty gun before 3 killers sent by Tuco; a torturous walk across the desert in a blazing sun; the epic battle between Union and Confederate soldiers for the control of a strategic bridge where Leone's camera takes a slow ride surveying the magnitude of the Civil War carnage; and the final showdown in a huge graveyard, where each character, naturally, wants the money all to himself...The amusing scenes are provided by Tuco, sitting in bathtub with a lot of foam and one armed man enters his room saying: ""I've been looking for you for 8 months... Now I find you in exactly the position that suits me...""The memorable scenes are when the Stranger finds himself in a dangerous situation at the hand of Tuco, who is just about to collect his vengeance by hanging his former partner... The stunning scenes when Leone's camera captures the touching moment in which a young man plays sweet romantic songs on his harmonica, while his eyes are streaming tears of disgrace and grief...The unforgettable scenes when the 'Stranger' leaving Tuco with a rope around his neck and the bandit begs for mercy while teetering on a wooden cross...The ultimate confrontation between the forces of good and evil when Leone spreads out long shots adjusting sound with action... Tensions mounts as the three protagonists 'shape in a triangular cinema cliché' Leone gets the audience's imagination with a geometric fight to the death, accompanied by a clear exciting music... Leone's camera captures every straight lines, every nervous energy, every tactical movement, displaying, in huge close-ups, their faces, their power of vision, the slowly progress of their fingers toward their loaded guns, their worried eyes, their sudden need to be quick, to be the fastest draw...","

"Xstal","19 December 2022","It's a story of three people on the run, from themselves, from poverty and from the gun, all chasing golden riches, in their saddle weary breeches, one-upmanship prevents, being outdone. Angel Eyes is a hardened mercenary, always finishes a job, he won't miscarry, has his sights set on a bounty, buried in, a cemetery, but two others will become, adversaries. Tuco is a cunning, cagey outlaw, never satisfied, wanting a few dollars more, devious and double crossing, scornful, sneering, often scoffing, wears a noose more than he'd like, below his jaw. Blondie plays it cool most of the time, makes his living freeing Tuco for his crimes, with his cigar and his poncho, he's an independent honcho, though a walk around the desert leaves him begrimed.Three outstanding performances in a film that stands the test of time and just gets better and better.","

"keihan","26 August 2000","Belfast-based comics writer Garth Ennis said it best: ""There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend...those who dig Clint Eastwood movies...and dweebs."" While I have to admit that my heart belongs to the opening act of ""The Man With No Name"" trilogy, ""A Fistful of Dollars"", there is no denial in my mind that ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is actually the better film. Many directors have tried imitating it's style (including Don Siegel's substandard ""Hang 'Em High"" and Eastwood's own first Western offering as star/director in ""High Plains Drifter""), but none have truly come close to the eccentricities on display here.I have a suspicion that the storyline is actually based on historical fact. Consider this account from Joel Rose's ""The Big Book of Thugs"" under the entry of ""The Reynolds Gang"": They were organized in 1863 by Texans Jim and John Reynolds. They were briefly interned in a Civil War prison camp for Confederate sympathizers and after being released, began making robberies that, according to Jim Reynolds, were to help out Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy. The loot was buried somewhere in the area of Handcart Gulch and Spanish Peaks in Colarado Territory and later, after Jim Reynolds and four members of his gang had been executed by Colonel John M. Chivington of the Union Army, John Reynolds, dying from a fatal wound during a holdup, supposedly whispered out the location of his old gang's ill gotten loot. Unlike the movie version, it was never found.Regardless of whether or not this was the actual basis for TGTBATU, it is nevertheless a film more grounded in history than a lot of it's comtemparies and, indeed, more than a few of it's successors. The Civil War is part of the backdrop, but it does so on a forgotten front of that war, the Western theater. Most high-school history classes would have us believe that nothing happened out West, but plenty did. In fact, the last skirmish of the war, if I'm not mistaken, was in New Mexico and, ironically enough, a Confederate victory.The central of this film is greed. You don't just see it in the quest for the Confederate gold by Blondie, Angel Eyes, and Tuco. There are signs of it everywhere; in the hotel manager talking about how he'll be glad to get the Northerners in town for the money they'll bring in, Bill Carson appealing to Tuco's greed for a single sip of water, the gang of cutthroats who are systematically robbing the Confederate prisoners of their goods. Set up against the harsh desert backdrop, it exposes the ultimate folly of that greed (the best symbol of it perhaps being the cemetary where the gold is buried). A little over a decade before the Reagan era of ""Greed is healthy, greed is good"", this film provides the ultimate rebuttal to that argument. Greed has gotten just as many men killed, if not more, than patriotism ever did. Such a subtext makes ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" the cinematic child of John Huston's ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" and the precursor to Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"".As great as Leone, Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach are, there is one member of this team that pushs this film into the status of greatness: score writer Ennio Morricone. Not only does he manage to write one of the most recognized theme tunes on the planet, he also adds the extra tension needed to convey the drama with the necessary oomph, the best examples being in Blondie's torturous walk across the desert, Tuco's frantic search through the cemetary (my personal favorite and so good that Lucasarts did a slowed-down version of it for their western shooter, ""Outlaws""), and, of course, the final three way shoot-out. He still composes scores for many other films to this day, I've been told. A good example of his most recent work would be the 1990 version of ""Hamlet"" starring Mel Gibson and directed by Franco Zefferelli. But I truly doubt that he'll ever be able to top the legendary work he did here.","

"tedg","26 April 2001","Spoilers herein.This film revolves around threes of various types and pairings among those threes. The grouping of three that is of interest to me are the cinematic influences behind this film: Hollywood westerns, Italian iconic painting, Japanese starkness in representation. These Italian westerns are important. Most movies are about other movies, but this one affected much of what followed. The western vocabulary was mature and popular well before movies, and with the detective story drove the first revolution in modern mass publishing. Its simple abstractions were converted to film (then radio and TeeVee) without change: the boy scout cowboy in the usually white hat, often singing. (In fact the modern pop country music borrows from this simple vocabulary and reference to the `genuine.') But all that, including the country music bit is pretty flat, stupid and dull.Italian cinema is based on a similar set of national icons, specifically religious icons. It is a more visual, visceral painterly vocabulary. Equally simple in stereotypes, but instead there are religiously based connections that give the impression of depth. Symbology is expected, even demanded. To this add postwar notions of irony which permeated European popular art. So the good guy was still good, but in a twisted way -- the twists shifting according to the chaos he encountered.In the US, John Ford was creating soft lush panoramas that would subliminally inspire a generation of environmentally aware viewers, but something more important came rushing in from Japan: Kurosawa. His films are abstract, directly evolved from Japanese watercolor narratives. These are also lush and beautiful, but not soft -- instead dusty, gritty, sometimes cruel. This world is not placid, merely a machine to test color and honor.In the Eastwood/Leone films, these three influences were deliberately enfolded. And a whole world's visual vocabulary shifted. In the US, we have since reinvented a part of our national character to ally with these images. (America's love affair with guns is a recent phenomenon.) How powerful cinema can be!This film may be recommended by others for entertainment value or something similar. That's fine, but I think it should be seen to help you understand the default world you are handed, so that you can put it into perspective -- to see that much of it is man-made.","

"slayer-3","28 September 1998","Rather than a review of a 30 year old movie, here is my recollection of a 30 year old movie. When was the first time you saw this movie? I remember the first time I saw this movie. Back in the '70s, one night there was 2 things on TV to choose from, this movie or a baseball game.  How do I remember a baseball game, it was the night Hank Aaron was going after Babe Ruth's homerun record. Baseball or a movie. Tuned into the the baseball game, flipped to the movie -a western, cool. 'Uh, what is this no one is talking it makes no sense'. After what seemed like an eternity somebody finally spoke, Lee van Cleef. The rest is Movie History. Since then I have seen this movie well over 25 times. Numerous lines that have been etched into my memory. Forget whatever minor flaws this movie has. Put yourself in the movie. Sergio Leon, John Ford these are the people that defined ""The Western"". On a scale of 1-10, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is nothing less than a 10. Plop the tape into the VCR, sit back and experience a classic.","

"NachoDaddie","28 May 1999","Ok- first, as mentioned in another review, the geographic/historical errors in this film are GLARING. You've got men carrying revolvers that look like old style cap-and-ball pistols, but they're loading them with metallic cartridges- historically about five years early. Eastwood carries a rifle that hasn't been invented yet, Tuco assembles a ""superpistol"" out of a Colt, a Remington, and a Smith and Wesson- impossible. And there was nothing of merit taking place between the North and South during the Civil War in the Southwest. Now, that aside, I must say that this is the Greatest western ever. I first saw this film when I was about ten. I'd never sat through an entire Western befor, even though my Dad watched them constantly. Since then, I've been through film school, watched hundreds of Westerns, learned to appreciate them- but NOTHING matches up to this. The Searchers, Stagecoach, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, The Gunfighter, High Noon, Shane- all great films, but saddled with the standard American Western morality- the good guy never takes liberties with the eastern schoolmarm, the bad guy wears a black hat, etc. Coming from Italy, TG,TB &TU isn't bound by these conventions. Blondie's the ""good guy""- but he's also a bounty hunter. He makes a living in a highly immoral way, but is obviously the ""good""- not because we're told, but from small acts- giving the dying soldier a cigar, making sure the Captain knows to hold on till he hears the bridge blow, the genuine regret he feel for having to let Shorty die. And while Angel Eyes may be the Bad, we at least know he has prinicpals- when he's hired for a job, he always sees the job through. And Tuco may be more immoral than the other two, but he's so savvy and his role so humorous that one can't bring oneself to look upon him disfavorably. In other words, historical inaccuracies aside, TG, TB, & TU maybe one of the most accurate portrayals of the West ever put on film- there are no clear-cut lines of conduct, no black and white, or even grey, but just a swirled palette of various facets of the human condition.","

"planktonrules","23 August 2006","While I have given some pretty long reviews to Clint Eastwood's Westerns--particularly the wonderful FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, I will only give a brief review of this movie because there are so many reviews already I doubt if my pontificating will actually influence many people. After all, this is widely seen as one of the greatest Westerns ever made and since I liked it immensely, there isn't much need to say more.Well, there are actually a few Westerns I liked a bit more--I am a HUGE fan of THE BIG COUNTRY. But, when it comes to style, originality and the epic proportions of this film, none can match it, though ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST comes very, very close. The acting and script are just fine and the music is intensely weird but effective. Of all the films I have seen with music by Ennio Morricone, this is his most intense and strangest. And it works perfectly in this film, but I also appreciate much of his more restrained work in other films and would never want all Westerns to have such distinctive and bizarre music as in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY--it would just lose its magic and might even tend to overwhelm the film.About the only negatives about this film are the title and it is a pretty violent film that the little ones probably shouldn't watch. There is a lot of blood and violence and you do get to see (yuck) Eli Wallach's butt. As for the title, sure, Lee Van Cleef was truly ""BAD"" and Eli Wallach was cure ""UGLY"", but Clint as ""the GOOD""? Well, his character was far from good--but of course, who would like the title to be ""The Kinda Good, The Bad And the Ugly""?! Not to be missed by any serious fan or the genre.","

"basrutten","25 December 2007","I must admit that I had some doubts prior to seeing this movie, considering its length and some people's comments that it is slow as molasses. Well, they were mostly right about that. GB & U is indeed a movie that does not always move very fast, and it does take a little getting used to. Yet if you manage to look past the slowness, this is easily one of the best movies ever made.This is one of those movies where nearly everything comes together in exactly the right way. First of all, there is a wonderful cast of characters. Clint Eastwood is at his best as the 'Good' (even though he's not strictly a good guy but more a bad guy with an honor code), Lee van Cleef is so truly evil that you'll long for his downfall with a passion, and Eli Wallach steals the show as the 'Ugly', turning him into a character that you'll root for even though he's quite clearly the least trustworthy character you'll ever meet.These wonderful characters engage in a quite complex plot full of twists and turns, as they are constantly trying to outwit and outshoot each other. There's quite a lot going on and in spite of the fact that the tone of the movie is actually fairly light (there is some truly good humor), it's actually a fairly good exploration of human nature and the lengths to which people will go to achieve their goals.And then, there's the music of course. Ennio Morricone has always composed some very distinct and recognizable tunes, which unfortunately were not always that great by themselves. The music here, however, is absolutely one of the most memorable scores ever.Of course, the cinematography is wonderful as well. The production values here seem to be a lot higher than in some previous Leone movies, and GB & U contains plenty of memorable shootouts that will truly keep you on the edge of your seat. At the same time, the gunmen here seem not nearly as invincible as in some other Leone movies, which greatly adds to the suspense.As I said before, nearly everything comes together in this movie. Sure, it might be a bit slow, but it's got a great story of good versus evil, told in an impressive and truly epic way, with memorable characters and shootouts everywhere. Highly recommended","

"johnnyboyz","28 April 2010","Sergio Leone's 1966 Western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly unfolds under this hostile, violent and hate filled umbrella of Civil War America; a fitting backdrop of ongoing warfare and hostilities to which two American men and a Mexican bandit strive to find a large box full of valuable coins buried out in the big country somewhere behind Confederate Army lines. In using a plot item as routine as said example and applying it to a relatively routine singular strand arc for the film's narrative to take, Leone essentially breathes so much life into a set up and plot plan that about half way through you forget the basic bare bones of the movie and find yourself going with it, utterly immersed in the tale the director's laying out in front of you. So much has been written and said about the film, like other such examples at the top of each genre, that further comment and analysis may seem futile. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly may very well be the pinnacle to the western as Psycho might be to horror or Apocalypse Now to the war, for instance. If it isn't, or either of the said examples aren't, then there will still be a large cluster of individuals that would sternly argue otherwise.The film begins with a loud and confrontational title sequence, a brash and expansive manner in which to announce your film has arrived; the sort that sees a flashing of character faces and arrays of different colour, a sequence in which even the little animated horse gets the full force of a cannonball that's been fired off. It sets the tone for a no holds barred ride of guns; gunslingers and no nonsense people with no nonsense attitudes as observations of greed and that of both a mid and post-war crumbling society plays out. The film features some of the best direction I've ever seen; Leone's ability to shift gears and change the film's tact from one thing to another, as loyalties shift and events take a turn for the different is near-flawless. His ability to essentially construct a number of small, minute set-pieces amidst this wide-open and dusty, hostile setting is immaculate; but the change of tact he applies later on towards the end of the film in capturing a Civil War battle between the North and South is just as impressive; portraying a larger fight sequence as the inevitable showdown between the film's three main players draws nearer and that sense their showdown will be of a similarly epic proportion, despite it being just another gunfight and despite the fact all of those thus far have been between grossly outmatched participants.Leone is all for spectacle and action to propel the plot, but his ability to capture the little things; the terrain and just the sounds that it omits is wonderful. The introduction of Angel Eyes, aka The Bad (van Cleef), for instance sees a young boy flee into his house on first sight of him as he arrives; Angel Eyes' boots stomping on a stone floor whilst he approaches an elderly man sitting at a table as a dog barks outside, all of it a routine use of composition and SFX, but the drawn out editing process; the fact a kid ran for his life at first sight of him and the semiotical driven noise of a barking dog which suggests a rabid animal or ominousness build the scene and character without anyone ever explaining or saying anything.They call him The Bad because he shoots without mercy and takes without conscience, leaving a family in tatters and on another occasion beats a girl to a near pulp until she gives him what info he's looking for. The name Angel Eyes is wholly ironic. This makes Clint Eastwood's 'Good' (aka Blondie) and Wallach's 'Ugly' (aka Tuco) perhaps look more favourable than they actually are when it's revealed they're mostly in it together against this blackly dressed; father/husband murdering; woman slapping figure of evil. Tuco and Blondie's relationship is a strange one, a mutual appreciation of one another and the death they leave in their wake. Tuco would no sooner shoot Blondie, than hang him, than act like they're best friends. No longer is 'The Good' of a western limited to wearing the sheriff's badge and/or cleaning up towns of drunks and no-good varmints; as here, 'The Good' would much rather come across as upstanding; fleece a local sheriff of $2,000 and then make off with the cash against the guy he was initially in tow with.Tuco's raging attitudes are captured in a single shot that encompasses a sketching of Christ on the cross as he swigs alcohol whilst wearing an eye-patch, the film at a point where Tuco seems to be doing good in aiding an old friend but perhaps with a traitorous eye still on the prize as the patch acts as a visual distinction of the two sides of his face doubling up as his sinful and righteous attitudes, whereas he gives the Holy Trinity throughout. But THE scene that encapsulates his character is in a store early on during which, betrayed and foaming at the mouth for revenge, he fondles some handguns in front of an elderly clerk before angrily discarding them. He then fondles some more and asks for bullets, drawing you into the scene in an utterly effective manner and its threat element within as we wonder what he has in store for the clerk above all else. There's a solid hour of character involvement and some set-piece exchanges which work wonderfully well; and a later juxtaposition between diegetic musical content with an interrogation brought a smirk to my face when I realised whom it was that felt so inspired to pay homage to such a sequence. The film is engrossing, rich in detail on so many levels and an absolute outright winner of a piece.","

"TheLittleSongbird","9 January 2011","Well what do you know? Another amazing movie from Sergio Leone. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly has so much good about it, and quintessentially it is one of the best westerns ever made. There may be nothing new about the story at first glance, but that's the point, Leone is paying homage to the Hollywood western, and despite the initial simplicity there is also a complexity mainly in the film's characters. Regardless of whether simple or complex it is, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly does have a compelling and brilliantly written story.But there are other assets that make The Good, The Bad and the Ugly so good. The dialogue is always excellent, while Leone's direction is superb once again. The characters are great and are superbly played. Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances ever here, and Eli Wallach is perfectly cast and more than a match for him. I was also very impressed with Lee Van Cleef, who I recognised from High Noon and such, but he makes a bigger impression here. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is also the most violent of the trilogy, and one of the most violent of the genre, not a bad thing whatsoever.The pace was spot on too, even though the film is nearly three hours long, it is never boring or dull. The best things though about The Good, The Bad and the Ugly are the visuals and Ennio Morricone's score. The film looks amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous and the sweeping images and scenery are very lovingly crafted. Morricone's score is even more impressive than that, it is simply one of the best film scores I've ever heard, and if I had to say which was Morricone's best score, I would immediately say this.Overall, there is nothing bad or ugly about the film. The film is amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"Maciste_Brother","10 January 2007","And Sergio Leone had to show Hollywood how a western should be done. Earthy, gritty, moody, rambling, funny and just plain nasty too. One thing most people forget about the Sergio Leone Dollar trilogy films is that they were made when westerns were really staid and boring, with zero atmosphere and very mechanical. Then came these movies, with THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY being the last and the greatest of the three Dollar films. Cinema wasn't the same after it was released. And to show influential this film is, it transcended its ""western"" genre and influenced practically every type of films made after that. Heck, I'm not even a western fan and I thoroughly admire what Leone and the gang created here. It's big, bold, melancholic, lusty, giddy and operatic.The thing I really love about THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is the atmosphere. It's almost one kind. Never duplicated in any other film since (and that includes Clint Eastwood's dry cowboy flicks). One major contributing factor is obviously Ennio Morricone's unforgettable score, probably one of the greatest scores ever made. The music during the ending, when Tuco searches the cemetery, it's spine tinglingly powerful.Of the three characters, Tuco steals the show. He's the heart and soul of film. It's probably Eli Wallach's greatest performance. He immersed himself in the role and, in the processed, really became Tuco.My only complaint about THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is that it is a low budget film and as expansive and epic as it is, the film sorta looks cheap. Practically everything was shot outside. There are few sets in the movie and when we are within four walls, the sets look, hmm, cheap. I just wished the production design was as expansive looking as the vision Leone had in mind. The film would have been perfect then. But that's something I can clearly overlook.When I watch a movie like THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, I get depressed. Depressed because at one time films were actually amazing, groundbreaking and entertaining. The 1960s were one of the greatest era in movie-making. Sadly today's films don't even come close to the stunning creative output of that decade. They should re-release THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY on the big screen. It's a classic film.","

"vonjenk","9 December 1998","This film probably had the largest impact on my life. It set the tone for everything I then got interested in. American Civil War. Film Music. Clint Eastwood. Real Westerns. This is the best of the Dollars Trilogy and by far one of the best Westerns of all time. It has drama, comedy, cracking dialogue, some of the most brutal battle scenes - especially around the bridge - that I'd seen up to then, music to die for and set pieces that just ooze atmosphere and tension. I have never forgotten the end shoot-out. This was unique; 3 people?! You can't do that. But Leone did, and he did it brilliantly - all cameras and music. I have now seen this film too many times to count but I'll be back for another blast of buono, brutto, cattivo, someday. My son owes his name to this film. Yep, that there is Clinton.","

"NpMoviez","14 April 2019","""You see in this world, there are two types of people my friend, those who love this film and those who're retarded."" This quote should be shared everywhere. Also, it's a spoiler free review, and it may seem to be a little vague.Good : It's a masterpiece. Don't agree with me? I don't care at all. Leone's visual storytelling has never been so great. The scores, the activities of the characters, the scenes were enough to tell the story. The dialogues are simply conversations between the characters. In the entire three hour runtime, there isn't a single expositionary dialogue, except for a total of 5 minutes. That's a very difficult task to do, and it does it with such an ease that we don't even notice it during the first viewing. Many difficult scenes have been shot very perfectly, which feels really obvious. There are a few point of view shots which makes it more interesting. The characterizations given to each of the three lead characters justify them as good, bad and ugly. There are many moments which justify their characterizations. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach have done a complete justice to their roles. This movie, being set in the American Civil War, has some elements of it. However, it doesn't glorify the war and doesn't take any side. It portrays war as one of the worst things - just like in the way it should be. The war scenes are too damn good. Well choreographed and incredible cinematography. You can see a whole bunch of people engaging, and it obviously was not CGI. It wasn't really necessary to show all of that, but it did and it was great (Sergio Leone rocks!). The violence does feel real and legit, in contrast to many of the older Westerns. Last but the important thing would be music, Ennio Morricone's score is entirely of next level good. Incomprehensibly great. It complements every scene and either escalates the tension (eg. the final showdown) or just develops emotional and dramatic factors. Also, contrary to this, there are some moments of silence which serve similar purpose of escalating the tension and drama. The music is so good that even if you (somehow) end up not liking the film, you will definitely love the score by Morricone. It has absolutely no negatives whatsoever. It deserves every bit of praise it receives.Conclusion : This is the Citizen Kane of Westerns. Every Western film (not necessarily Spaghetti) is compared with this. There is a reason why. This is a highly recommended film not only for Western lovers, but for every movie lover out there. As for me, I heard a lot of great things about it, then, I was ready to be disappointed, but I was blown away by it. It was way above my initial expectations, and delivered a lot more than that. Recently, only Infinity War managed to do so. It is a gem of a movie.Rating.Score : absolute 10/10Grade : A+","

"smatysia","18 February 2008","There's not a lot to say about this one that hasn't been said. You have to enjoy the sweeping, desolate Spanish vistas. And, as it has been pointed out as a plot hole, it is an interesting technique that what ever is out of the frame, is unnoticed by the characters, such as Angel Eyes making it all the way to the Stanton grave without being noticed approaching (on horseback) over open land. I found it distracting the way many characters spoke in Spanish or Italian and were dubbed into English. I have always disliked dubbed movies and preferred subtitles, but this one was odd, with some characters speaking English, and some not. It must have made for interesting rehearsals and filming. I would have to agree with others that Eli Wallach largely stole the show. And does anyone know if Lee Van Cleef really was short part of his right middle finger, or did they splice in someone else's hand for that shootout scene?","

"Mr-Fusion","9 June 2014","There's a meandering nature about ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" that keeps me from enjoying it as highly as I think I should. It's certainly not as tight as ""For a Few Dollars More"", and it really tends to drag during the desert torture and the army scenes (which pop up with surprising frequency). Even the final shootout was too much; I just wanted Leone to get on with it. It's ""epic"" scope just seems to topple in on itself.That said, there's much to like here, and the built-up acclaim over the years is certainly merited. For one, the framing and composition in this film are amazing. Not sure I've seen such effective use of widescreen in another western. Leone knows how to make the western landscapes eye- catching. Each of the film's stars fits his character well (Wallach, especially, who just seems to relish Tuco's streetrat sense of guile). And it's just one double-cross after another, right up until the very end. It's fun from that standpoint. Just overinflated.7/10","

"Hitchcoc","14 August 2019","Since there isn't much original that I can add, I just want to make sure that no stone is unturned. The three principles in this epic are so well developed. There are no really ""good"" guys, despite the title. But they are so well drawn that we are intrigued by the clash of spirits. It is very much like reading the Iliad. When Achilles dons the armor, he is going after another hero and must defeat one he respects. Here, respect may be the wrong word, but viable adversaries have a kind of sense of immovable object and irresistible force. There is so much violence and so many confrontations, it works so well. It, of course, got us away from the horse opera, or even the white hat of John Wayne (not to diminish the joy of those films) and created an opening for the anti-hero. What a piece of cinema.","

"Angry_Arguer","10 August 2003","Sergio Leone is an underappreciated talent.  His skill, in most cases, exceeds what he actually puts on the screen.  This is, by far, his crowning achievement and the culmination of both his work and Clint Eastwood's career.  After this, it is only pushing the plateau without success.The primary focus of this movie is not the characters, the story winds up being the least of Leone's concerns.  Instead, he is concerned about the camera and the music.  Ennio Morricone, a genius in his own right, was seriously ignored by the Academy for his compilation here--certainly one of the Top 10 ever.  He understands the crude editing of the mid-60s and exploits everything he can from the vision onscreen.  If Leone was dissatisfied with the Ennio's final product, something MUST have been wrong with him.The camera is another element that never lies.  Modern filmmakers should study this before they try emulating MTV next time.  With Leone's grandeur and a cast that understands that they aren't the real focus, how can he lose?The story, while it isn't the greatest, is better delivered than such works as The Wild Bunch.  Perhaps only High Noon understands the value of pacing and what to reveal/not reveal to the audience.  Then again, Fred Zinnemann is an entirely different director.  The character interaction here is certainly better than what Gary Cooper has to offer, not to mention the dialog includes some uncanny deliver by Eli Wallach.Overall, a classic.  This is a definer of the unconventional Western and visual literature.  4.5 out of 5 stars.  A must see.","

"Hancock_the_Superb","10 July 2007","In New Mexico Territory circa 1862, a mysterious bounty-killer known as ""Blondie"" (Clint Eastwood) and a shifty Mexican bandit, Tuco Ramirez (Eli Wallach), run a con job wherein Blondie turns Tuco in for money and then rescues him, splitting the reward money. However, the two engage in numerous double-crossings against each other, until stumbling across a dying Confederate soldier (Antonio Casale) who gives each man a clue to the location of a hidden cache of gold. Tuco and Blondie re-form their alliance to find the gold, only to find that Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless hired gun, is already after the gold. The three men form a frequently-changing series of alliances to get at the gold, and they must avoid the Union and Confederate armies operating in the region.""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is a landmark film in many respects. Its cultural influence is nigh-impossible to overstate, with its iconic musical score by Ennio Morricone, three memorably amoral protagonists, the close-ups, vast landscapes, and the title itself, all of which are instantly recognizable icons of cinema, having been referenced and replicated time and again in movies, TV shows, and even commercials. It is Sergio Leone's first truly great film, a transition from the low-budget Spaghetti Westerns (""A Fistful of Dollars"", ""For a Few Dollars More"") to the big budget, artistic epics that Leone would make for the rest of his career (""Once Upon a Time in the West/America""). It is also a film of utmost importance to me; after watching this movie as an eleven year old, admiring its wonderfully quirky characters, style, music, and breath-taking cinematography, I realized for the first time that I wanted to devote my life to films, be it watching them, writing on them, or hopefully making them.""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is a full-blown epic, and one with an interesting subtext. We see three completely amoral characters whose crimes - robbery, murder, and racketeering - are minor compared to the brutal carnage we see the Civil War inflicting. Taking place during the little-known Sibley Campaign in New Mexico, the film is not a documentary depiction of the war, but an allegorical one. This was the first total war, and Leone uses it as a metaphor for conflict in general, with faceless mass slaughter inflicted by rifles, machine guns, and artillery. Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes' transgressions are minor compared to a brutal, Auschwitz-like concentration camp, spies being executed in the streets, towns being shelled, and vicious, stalemated trench warfare over a ""flyspeck"" of a bridge. Even our amoral heroes have amounts of humanity which set them apart from the machine-like slaughter around them; Blondie saves Tuco's life and comforts dying soldiers of both sides; Tuco struggles with a mixture of affection and hatred for Blondie, and his troubled relationship with his brother (Luigi Pistilli), and even Angel Eyes shows disgust at the carnage he sees.The movie is extremely episodic, the plot only secondary to the adventures of these characters. Leone's wonderful direction gives the film a fairy-tale quality, with an appearance of realism while being fanciful and at times almost surreal. The movie contains extremely memorable set pieces: the lengthy opening, with three gunmen going after Tuco; the ""carriage of the spirits""; the prison camp; a shootout in a town under shellfire; an epic Civil War battle; Tuco running excitedly through the cemetery; and, of course, the unforgettable climactic ""triello"". Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography is simply breath-taking, with desert landscapes as impressive as David Lean's films contrasting with the most extreme close-ups imaginable. Carlo Simi's set designs, from shelled-out towns to prison camps to the cemetery, is breath-taking. And Ennio Morricone's score is, for lack of a better word, one of the most amazing ever written, the instantly recognizable theme tune and other brilliant pieces creating the movie's indescribable atmosphere.The cast creates unforgettably iconic characters. Clint Eastwood is back as the Man With No Name, here much more human in this film despite retaining his cool, detached, shifty nature. Lee Van Cleef, who had played a likable character in Leone's previous film, now plays one of the most memorably evil characters ever. Aldo Giuffre, Antonio Casas, and Luigi Pistilli are effective in supporting roles, and Leone's usual stock cast - Mario Brega, Benito Stefanelli, Al Muloch, Aldo Sambrell, and many others - create their own iconography. But it's Eli Wallach who steals the show, as the scenery chewing Tuco, a shifty, double-crossing, foul-mouthed bandit who manages to be the most likable and human of the cast despite his faults; truly, one of the most memorable film characters ever.""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is one of the most well-known and influential movies ever made, and with good reason. In terms of style, it is an absolute triumph, being one of the most amazingly made movies ever made. Those only familiar with the movie for its cast, its score, or peripherally through its iconic stature, are missing out on one of the most breath-taking cinematic experiences ever. Thank you, Sergio Leone.9/10","

"Infofreak","20 July 2003","Most people choose 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' as the best of Sergio Leone's superb spaghetti western ""trilogy"" (I'm putting trilogy in inverted commas because the three movies actually have no connection to each other, and Clint Eastwood, despite the ""Man With No Name"" tag,  plays a different character in each). Now it's a very close call I admit, but as much as I love this movie I'm inclined to choose the one before it 'For A Few Dollars More' as my favourite. Anyway, this is still a superb piece of pure entertainment, and Leone's movies had a massive impact on not just the western genre but action and adventure movies of all kinds. Clint Eastwood is super cool playing ""Blondie"" just as he was as Joe in the first movie and Monco in the second. FAFDM added a strong supporting character by Lee Van Cleef, TGTBATU continues that (though Van Cleef is playing a completely different guy) and also brings in  Eli Wallach as Tuco, who adds some nice comic touches.  Blondie and Tuco have lots of great scenes together, but I could have done with a lot more Angel Eyes (Van Cleef), one of the greatest screen villains of all time. Having three strong roles instead of just Eastwood is one of the great things about this movie. Another great thing is the unforgettable score by Morricone. Morricone did some of his most memorable work with Leone, and this could just be the best of the lot. Certainly the main theme (a massive hit single in the late 1960s as covered by Hugo Montenegro) is one of the most recognisable and original pieces of film music ever. Another standout is the spectacular bridge scene, surely a direct inspiration for Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch', a movie which owed Leone a sizable debt in my opinion. It's very difficult to pick this movie apart and single out what is so great about it as it really works as a whole. There's almost nothing wrong with it. It's one of the greatest westerns ever made and a hugely enjoyable movie that is just as compelling on your tenth viewing as your first. If you haven't seen it before I still think watching 'A Fistful Of Dollars' and 'For A Few Dollars More' first is the smartest movie, despite the three movies being a trilogy in name only, and each of the three being able to stand alone. Each movie is brilliant stuff and each comes with my highest recommendation. Movies don't get much more entertaining than this!","

"dvc5159","26 September 2008","A big, bravado, bold and exquisite film for its time, Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" remains one of the most seminal, influential, and exciting films of all time. With its superb cast, its beautiful and wide scenery, and its superior action sequences, this film is a masterpiece. A picture that embodies the perfect personification of masculinity. A true man's picture, and one that will stand tall among most movies today.The simple tale of how three gunslingers form an unlikely alliance of hate, in order to find $200,000 (that's $6 million by today's standards) worth of stolen gold, in a country that is ravaged by war, is elegantly told by the maestro of westerns, Sergio Leone. For its time, Spaghetti Westerns were not considered genuine art, but rather, entertainment instead. Sergio Leone is probably the only director who is smart enough to make his film compelling to mainstream and critical audiences alike. His direction is smart and strong, and you see how well his direction is as per the amount of manpower and creativity in handling the action sequences. The action sequences are raw, crisp, grand, explosive, and taut. Especially the Standoff at the end. Leone should probably be awarded a Nobel Prize for that scene alone. Leone is probably why westerns are popular among the youth of the '60s, hell, he probably influenced would be filmmakers at the time. I know of one who was particularly influenced by Leone's direction - Quentin Tarantino himself said that this film is the best-directed film of all time. And yes, although the film may be long, there's not a scene that goes by that you'll say boring.Clint Eastwood - The Good. The legendary Man With No Name. His character perfectly embodies with the true meaning of masculinity. As per in his previous films, he plays a mysterious gunslinger, one with a deadly aim and a strong sense of honor and pride. He is the perfect hero, and this film stands out as one of Clint's, if not his, best film ever.Lee Van Cleef - The Bad. Here, instead of the fatherly Doug Mortimer in the previous ""For A Few Dollars More"", we get the stone-cold assassin Angel Eyes. Van Cleef plays him chillingly to the bone. He is wicked, he is ruthless, he is cruel. He would kill anyone, be it his targets or even his own client.Eli Wallach - The Ugly. He is Tuco, a criminal on the loose. He is the most interesting character in the film, as we see the ugly side of man through him. He is two-faced, slimy, arrogant, and hate-able. But that what makes his character great. There is no substitution for Wallach, he will always be Tuco no matter what.The cinematography is absolutely beautiful. We get to see the backdrop of the glorious Wild West and the battlefields of war in all its unfaded glory. Even the cemetery scene is filmed extremely well. The music - that's another thing. The music, is masterful, so sublime, so grandiose, and so haunting. It's mesmerizing, really, to hear the great Ennio Morricone's score while looking at the actions of people, it perfectly matches the film. Not forgetting to mention the iconic and haunting theme song that's embodied itself in popular culture even until today.So, yes, this is truly cinematic brilliance. If you want to see the film in all it's glory, I reckon you readers get the extended cut DVD of the film. It's Leone's true version of this film, and it would do you some good to see his true film, not to mention the remastered picture and 5.1 sound so that you can hear the gunshots and explosions in all its fury. Make no mistake readers, this film is one of the most iconic movies ever made, and it can be proud of its status as ""Greatest Western Ever Made"". Now if only movies like these were made today as well...Overall rating: 10/10Delton","

"ma-cortes","19 July 2004","This is a bemusing, violent and stylish Western, it's the best Sergio Leone . The film takes part of ¨the man without name¨ trilogy united to ¨For a fistful dollars¨, and ¨ A few dollars more¨.The movie centers about the ugly (Eli Wallach) , the bad (Lee Van Cleef) and the good (Clint Eastwood) in search for a Confederate treasure buried on a cemetery whose tracks have got the three enemies and is set during American Civil War.It's too much violent but is neither tiring, nor boring, but entertaining. The film mingles noisy action , impressive battles, shootouts, violence with strong tortures, tongue in cheek, satire and a little bit of humor.The final showdown between the three contenders is breathtaking.In spite of the fact the runtime is overlong , nevertheless isn't dull . Direction by Sergio Leone is magnificent. Ennio Morricone musical score is extraordinary , the soundtrack has been imitated and copied by thousand occasions. Morricone's iconic theme music was designed in places to mimic the sound of a howling coyote . Production design by Carlo Simi and cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli is riveting . Shot in the deserts and landscapes of Spain : Burgos and Almeria , with 1,500 Spanish soldiers as extras .Eli Wallach is very well , as he steals the show , he interprets a humorous and greedy murderous thief , Lee Van Cleef plays a villain and ominous killer and Clint Eastwood makes a dirty and wry 'man without name'.This quintaessential 'Spaguetti' originated great influence of wide range in Western . It was such a good picture that had a great success. Followed by ¨ Once upon a time in West¨and ¨Duck you sucker¨.Rating: very nice, above average 8'5/10","

"droog-56936","27 November 2019","This sprawling epic changed the way the western and cinematic gunplay was shown on film. Brutal, funny and packed with characters that flow in and out of the narrative without ever feeling disjointed or dashed together. Sergio Leone pushed the boundaries of his previous two westerns and told a tale of three men and their travails through the end of the civil war in search of the hidden gold maguffin.
The result was so revolutionary that this movie is burned in the quilt of our culture.The iconic music..Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name...the closeups..everything here is classic. Arguably the best western ever made and certainly the most ambitious.","

"bobbaxter","11 July 2006","The basic plot of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY has been done before. In fact, the film inverts the premise of TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE. In TREASURE, the three men searching for the gold worked as a team. The team broke down because of external pressure (the bandits) and internal pressure (Fred C. Dobb's paranoia). In THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, the three men searching for the gold never team up. They are kept apart by internal pressure (the fact that one of them is a murdering sadist) and external pressure (the ebb and flow of the Civil War).In TREASURE, only one member of the team knew how to find gold. Here, the location of the gold is a secret. Two men know opposite halves of the secret. Blondie (Clint Eastwood) knows a name on a grave. Tuco Ramirez (Eli Wallach) knows the name of the cemetery. Their shared secret forces the two men into an uneasy alliance. The third seeker is Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a professional killer. He has learned about the gold from one of his victims.The opening and Ennio Morricone's unique theme music set the tone: this will be a harsh, gritty, offbeat film. Freeze-frames tell us which character will be good (Blondie), which will be bad (Angel Eyes) and which will be ugly (Tuco). The difference between the three men isn't motive, since they all want the same thing. What sets them apart from each other is what they are willing to do to get it. Angel Eyes will torture and kill anybody who gets in his way. Tuco is a bully and a loudmouth, but he only kills in self-defense. Blondie is quiet and intelligent, a planner who carefully works out every detail well in advance.THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is set in a harsh, unforgiving landscape. The quest for the gold takes our characters through a desert, a prison camp, a war-ravaged frontier town, a Civil War battle and, finally the cemetery where the inevitable showdown happens. The few outposts of civilization huddle against a vast, imposing wilderness. In such places, even the best man has to be a little bit bad and ugly to survive.","

"Leofwine_draca","23 July 2016","Leone's conclusion to his DOLLARS trilogy once again shows how he had progressed as a director from the previous two films - with his style now evident and developed, his pacing slowed down to a gentle speed and exactly the right combination of editing, photography, and art direction, Leone was ready to make what many consider to be his greatest film - ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Unfortunately, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is sometimes overlooked in place of that film, and although it's only the third of a trilogy, the film still has an epic feel to it.This film's main benefit over the previous two is Ennio Morricone's score. While his music was very good in A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, here it becomes the stuff of legend and one of most recognised western tunes ever written; it's also by and far Morricone's best ever work, to this day. Leone retains the solid Eastwood from the previous two films and also brings back Lee Van Cleef, this time playing a bad guy (unfortunately - I prefer his heroes to his villains as I like the guy). Most screen time, though, is given to THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN's Eli Wallach, who is also excellent as the wanted criminal Tuco, a man who lives by his wits and courage and isn't afraid to take risks.Eastwood plays his role to perfection, as he should with so much practice. He gets to say some well-remembered lines such as ""There are two kinds of people in this world, my friend..."" Van Cleef is exceptionally evil and sadistic as the villain of the piece, my only complaint is that he has relatively little screen time in comparison to the other two main stars and thus feels slightly underused. Also appearing are some familiar faces like Luigi Pistilli and Rada Rassimov.The plot is a wider and more political one than before, as it shows how the Civil War intruded upon the quiet serenity of the Old West. The brief battle scenes we do see are sweeping and epic, up there with the best put on film. Leone's direction is stylish and a work of genius, and he serves up a number of odd, memorable situations. These include a shoot-out in a bombed town, complete with blackened smoking ruins; an ingenious way to remove handcuffs; and the blowing up of a bridge. The scene is also set for one of the best sequences in cinema; the confrontation between Wallach, Van Cleef, and Eastwood in the cemetery at the film's end. Here, the music, quick photography (close-ups of people's eyes, etc.) and acting combine to make this one of the coolest, most tense showdowns in history. One must not forget the element of comedy which Leone also uses to make the film lighter and more enjoyable; he succeeds well. Definitely one of the best spaghetti westerns out there.","

"pgruendler-1","17 July 2006","Eight of Ten Stars. I was so enamored of this movie as a teen that my Northwestern University freshman dorm wall was papered with big B&W posters of mssrs. Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef in the Fall of 1968. I was quite the little existentialist then; ""If it feels good, DO IT!"" was the mantra of my high school Senior English teacher. Well, it felt good, and bad, and ugly. I ended up dropping out of Northwestern after Kent State and, taking the soundtrack of GBU (in my head) with me to Vietnam in 1971, I proceeded to get a real-world education in the old 'ultra-violence' as an infantryman in the AMERICAL Division... WHAT you may ask does this have to do with an American Civil War movie, directed and written by an Italian Communist? (Sergio Leone's daddy may have been more of a commie than Sergio was, but the fact is that ""A Fistful of Dollars"" was STOLEN from Kurosawa, while ""The Magnificent Seven"" was PURCHASED years before. The end justifies the means? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?) http://www.fistful-of-leone.com/classic/articles/prof.html I found out firsthand the moral ambiguities of war. If only I had paid attention to the subtext in GBU! If only I had studied the Matthew Henry battlefield dead tintypes as Leone so obviously had! His hideous, rotting carcases of Union and Confederate soldiers, bloating in direct sunlight, would have sufficiently revulsed me from any notion that I could 'play soldier' and survive! But here I am, having just barely survived.... and I just got out of the fabulous Fox Theater here in Atlanta where the restored GBU was projected in all its Technicolor/Technirama glory at fully loaded, screaming Morricone volume.... there must have been at least a thousand people there, and hardly anyone moved. INCREDIBLE. It is said that the movie was made to the tunes Morricone made prior to production's start; i.e. Leone played the music while shooting the scenes! Hence, these epics are giant music videos - fantasias - symphonic cinema- they are huge, elegiac tone poems! And, God help me, I still love this movie.","

"mjg32","28 February 2007","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly has a very basic storyline - 3 cowboys trying to collect a fortune in gold. Sergio Leone then set this story against a backdrop of the American civil war. It is visually stunning, and has enough action for 10 films, let alone 1. Okay, so its not geographically or historically correct, but seriously, if you care about those things so much that you don't like the film, then you are just plain sad. The 3 main characters are excellent; Clint Eastwood as the laid back hero, Eli Wallach as his dirty Mexican partner and Lee van Cleef as the evil gunman who kills for a living. The whole film is like a work of art, leading up to the final gunfight in a stadium like cemetery, 1 of the best scenes in film history. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly isn't one of those films that is thought provoking, but it is one of the best simply because for 3 hours it is very entertaining, and a thing of beauty.","

"tieman64","17 September 2010","""Nostalgia is a product of dissatisfaction and rage. It is a settling of grievances between the present and the past. The more powerful the nostalgia, the closer you come to violence. War is the form nostalgia takes when men are hard-pressed to say something good about their country."" – Don DeLillo ""God's not on our side because he hates idiots also."" - BlondieItalian iconography meets Akira Kurosawa meets Hollywood Westerns, Sergio Leone's ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" marks the point at which cinema took its first big steps (if we ignore the works of Godard) into the arena of postmodernity. From here would spawn the likes of George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" and later Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"", each generation of Leone devotees increasingly flat and weightless.Leone's own work would become increasingly suffused with postmodernism's undertow of nostalgia and regret, films like ""West"" and ""America"" less about plot than they are a film nerd's feverish dreams, all the tropes of the gangster and the western genre fetishized and mourned, a series of melancholic referrals to Ford, Hawks, Boetticher, Anthony Mann, Raoul Walsh, George Stevens and the hard boiled literature of Chandler and Hammett (the first two ""dollars"" movies are essentially film noirs with horses). These films aren't about the passage of time, but the passage of cinema, a child's attempt to hold on to the images of his past. No surprise that Leone's cites John Ford's ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"" as his favourite Western, as it's Ford's most melancholic and nostalgic film.Leone's films are thus primarily concerned about living with the image of ""America"", and never ""being"" American. His films revolve around a vision of America as an all pervading presence always seen from a distance, through the image. In this regard, many of his films rely on flashbacks and memory. Think the nostalgia, longing and melancholy of Colonel Mortimer in ""For a Few Dollars More"", of Harmonica and Cheyenne in ""West"", and the protagonists of ""Dynamite"" and ""America"", all of whom reflect Leone's own nostalgic feelings towards an America which he imagined, discovered, idealised, desired and naively longed for as a child (and latter as an artist). Paradoxically, however, Leone's nostalgia doesn't owe itself to distance from or homesickness for real things and places; his is a purely artistic, and so dangerous, nostalgia. What he misses are signifiers, artistic representations, and so the constant in Leone's films is therefore not subversion (that's Altman), like many claim, but rather infatuation; in the end, myths remains myths and at most they can be restated and updated, but not overturned.French philosopher Jean Baudrillard dubbed ""The Good the Bad and The Ugly"" the moment when modernism died and cinema began its crawl toward postmodernism. Baudrillard uses this term in a negative sense, speaking of a cultural obsession with ""lost objects"", referrals and went on to predict art's progression toward a kind of ""weightlessness"" (eg ""Kill Bill"") or reliance on resurrection and pastiche. While this is true for Leone's later films, ""TGTBATU"" belongs more to that sweet spot in world cinema (the late 60s and early 70s) in which iconoclasts like Antonioni, Altman, Peckinpah, Kubrick, Godard etc were thriving.And so while ""TGTBATU"" pulls from everywhere, both stylistically (the opening credits are modelled on the James Bond franchise, a series which Leone loved) and logistically (the film had financial backers in Germany, Spain and America, the cast were from all over the world and all spoke different languages etc), it's far more than a celluloid mash-up. It retains a certain weight typical of the 60s, more akin to the violent works of Siegel and Arthur Penn or the revisionist westerns of Altman, Peckinpah and late career Huston and Ford. Of course during this period you also had other extremely important but less known directors like Monte Hellman, Sydney Pollack, Robert Benton, Abraham Polonsky, George Hill, William Wiard, Elliot Silverstein and Ralph Nelson all making different kinds of interesting westerns (""Tom Horn"", ""A Man Called Horse"", ""Soldier Blue"" etc).The point is, Leone didn't ""shatter the myth"" of the Old West. Everyone during this period was doing that. Everyone was working against traditional concepts of heroism and justice. No, what Leone did was re-mythologise the West using the iconoclastic techniques of 60s and 70s cinema. He dirtied things up and then put these larger than life men back up on pedestals.Of course what ""TGTBATU"" is really known for is its wonderful ""comic book"" style. Bob Dylan crossed from folk to electric in 1965, and here was Leone making the same transition, serving up a rock and roll Western with electric guitars. And so we have masterful widescreen Techniscope compositions, powerful juxtapositions between wide shots and extreme close ups, Ennio Morricone's innovative score, a cast of slimy, dirty heroes (the film's sloppy sound dubbing works in its grimy favour) and a tale that is flippant, ironic and playfully told.Though thin like a comicbook, the film also has a very primordial undertow, a certain weight, with its dreamlike terrain of bombed out ghost towns and a soundtrack which mimics rattlesnakes, coyotes and horses. Its plot may simply consists of sweaty scroungers navigating a landscape perpetually covered in war, death and suffering, but there's nevertheless something very ""human"", existential even, about the film. Leone distills human nature down to simple elements and then injects a tone of regret such that the film seems to mourn the very ""archetypal humanity"" it revels in. Seems to mourn the very greed, violence and death that orbits around and within its small cast of characters. According to Leone, there's a little bit of good, bad and ugliness in everybody. Every bastard in this film earns our sympathy, even if we know they'd be the first to stab us in the backs.9.5/10 – (TGTBATU) 8.5/10 – (FAFDM), 8/10 – (DYS, OUATIA, AFOD), 7.9/10 - (OUATITW)","

"Rectangular_businessman","4 July 2010","Sergio Leone's massive epic is one of my favorite films, pitting a manic Eli Wallach as Tuco against an autistic Clint Eastwood (Leone: Eastwood has two acting emotions, with hat on and hat off). Lee Van Cleef hovers around the the center of the film menacing everyone, although his performance fades between the tension of Wallach and Eastwood. Ostensibly a story about the search for buried gold, GBU undercuts its exploitative surface by giving us almost Beckett-like relationship between a man that is wanted for murder and his partner who turns him in for the reward and then shoots the rope off his neck, a droll comment on human existence if there ever was one. Other existential moments occur in this rich film, such as the beautiful song the confederate prisoners sing while Angel-Eyes tortures Tuco, and the essay on the nature of the futility and pointless brutality of war appears when Tuco and Blondie witness a battle on a bridge they must cross.Chaotic, cynical, sentimental, violent, GBU resembles an opera more than anything. Amazingly, when this film first appeared in 1967, most critics wrote it off as one more Spaghetti Western, not seeing the fatalism, the grandeur, and the comedy of this world classic. How could you watch a film with a score like Morricone's finest and not be impressed? Don't mistake this film for realism and criticize it on that basis, as some reviewers have done. This is not a documentary-style Western (for that see McCabe & Mrs. Miller), but a Romance, based more in the imagination, more in symbolism, bowing to the classical westerns stereotypes and clichés.11/10","

"gottogorunning","13 August 2005","This movie has style - in a very elemental way - so to speak. You get an idea of the deadly, dreary desert, the deadlier bounty hunters and the deadliest of 'em all - Clint Eastwood - the man with no name! The story is a simple one to follow and is brilliantly executed by Sergio Leone using just the right landscapes along with some pretty good sets too (like the one featuring the Civil War sequence). Some of the scenes were meant to be symbolic (especially the Civil War scenes) and they did their job well.Eli Wallach is simply superb with his ""Blondieeee!!!"" screams and curses. Lee Van Cleef seems as deadly as the great Eastwood himself as ""The Bad"" guy.Cinematography - not as continuous as one would like - but manages to convey the tension in the dueling scenes very effectively.Also, the music - Ennio Morricone at his best! He has dished out some very innovative and brilliant stuff for all the three ""great"" westerns and this along with ""For a Few Dollars More"" seems to be his best.Finally, the style! Sergio Leone can certainly teach a thing or two to Quentin Tarantino or The Wachowski Brothers - in fact Tarantino acknowledges Leone's great style. And then the epitome of style himself - Clint Eastwood - with a half-burnt cigar in his lips, unshaven face, tilted hat, ragged jeans, a worn out poncho and the sharpest scowl ever which can rub out any ""Neo-with-million-dollar-goggles"" off the face of the Earth.Not genre-defining, surely - it was invented by Hollywood. But somebody from Europe really showed the world how to make westerns.","

Well those things hardly matter when you have Blondie, Tuco, Angel Eyes , The drunk Army Captain on screen exhibiting something completely out of this world in terms of cinematic achievement.I have never seen a better genre in movies than westerns and in that genre this movie stands out.

"secondtake","21 May 2010","The Good, The Bad, The Ugly (1966)A classic? Well, not so fast. Are we really okay with brutal (if brief) mistreatment of women, fast and senseless bloodshed, and lots of bad overdubbing of dialog?Maybe.Yes, this is a cinematic movie, and if you can overlook its flaws (some) you will be wowed and dazzled by its merits (very many).Overflowing with archetypes, filmed with huge widescreen effect, brimming with familiar scenes vividly re-imagined, this is a movie that is dramatic (or ironic) in softspoken (or cynical) ways. There are gunslinging shootouts, long lonesome treks across the desert, and showdowns between tough guys. Yup. And it's all built around a story that leads scene after scene to one big moment after another. There's no question this is a movie that is great fun to watch. In fact, for its visuals, the sheer cinematography and sets and editing, this is as good as it gets, amazing stuff. The man behind that was Tonino Delli Colli, the cinematographer for some other of director Sergio Leone's legendary movies beyond this one: Once Upon a Time in the West, and Once Upon a Time in America (and well as the astonishing Life is Beautiful.) But overall, for its content, its plot, its message (if that matters), is TGTBTU a great film, a masterpiece?Well, the movie is smart. It deliberately plays off of its genre, which had worn itself thin by the 1960s, so things push over the top in a campy, awesome, excessive way. It almost feels obliged to revisit and exaggerate all the themes of American Westerns, including the Civil War, including slapping women around and killing people in a flurry of fast six-shooter magic. Even the title makes clear this is about a stripped down, pumped up version of older classics. Whatever his aura over time, Clint Eastwood is no great actor, not in my book, and here he is easily out shined by Eli Wallach, who plays a less attractive type, and by Lee Van Cleef, who plays a more attractive one. But Eastwood isn't meant to be acting, not exactly. He has aura. He's stoic and inscrutable, exaggerated make-up and all, and he shoots a mean Colt, or Smith and Wesson, something classy and throbbing. He's a great archetype, in a movie that is about archetypes. It's not a ""realistic"" movie, of course, not at all, and it's actually a comedy at times, overall, and it's totally fun and never laughable.Go ahead, compare it to The Wild Bunch, and then to Butch Cassidy, both coming just after this one (and no doubt influenced by it). Both of these later movies have more impressive acting, and more intense intentions (both in brutal violence and in cinematic innovation). But all three have a similar effect, playing within a genre that has always, since the 1939 Stagecoach, been beautifully trapped by its limitations (that's part of its staying power for fans). The Searchers (1956) and High Noon (1952), for starters, are working within the genre, and gnawing at it, as if its something to feed off of. That's where The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly really shines. I have trouble with aspects of it, but I really like it in a bigger sense, looking the other way as needed. I switch to first person because I think it's a personal preference, and a lot of guys I know love the movie to pieces, and a couple women I know think it's either stupid or insulting or boring (actually boring!). It's an Italian production, which explains some of the out of sync dubbing. Sergio Leone obviously has an intuitive sense of what makes a movie moving, something sorely missed in a lot of productions since. It's gritty, dirty, and it pounds ""profound"" hard in a male kind of ""toughness prevails"" way. Sorry guys, but bite that bullet. Oh, and the soundtrack? Amazing, perfect, and rising above the movie, which is great in its own way, I admit.","

"theoledoux","29 August 2020","Sergio Leone delivered a masterpiece with The Good, The Bad And The Ugly. 54 years later this film still holds up as one of the best Westerns of all time. (if not the best) Of course, ""Once upon a time in the West"" comes close, but this movie was a bit more thrilling in the end. Personnally, I found that the synergy between Tuco and Blondie was more powerful and interesting than the two protagonists in that film. You care for Tuco, but in the same way Blondie does. In my opinion, his actor performed the best out of the trio. While I watching I couldn't stop thinking about how many newer films got inspired by his character. It seems like everything from Pirates of The Caribbean to Tarantino studied this movie closely to create their worlds. And I'm not complaining, because frankly if more people did, we wouldn't have to deal with so many contrieved story lines.","

"Robert_duder","22 July 2006","I have been a Clint Eastwood fan for years. But I have NEVER watched his Westerns. That's kind of idiotic isn't it?? Well suddenly I'm having an Eastwood movement and sinking myself into Westerns for the first time in my life and it only made sense that I start with what some critics and fans call ""The Greatest Western ever made."" In some respects I agree with that because it embodies everything that the Western is...even if you have never seen a Western you know the way they are supposed to go and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly encompasses every aspect of the stereotypical Western. Also a film like this has to be judged by it's release time as well and for 1966, this film's violent and gritty story would have made heads explode and Eastwood's trademark Man with No Name made Eastwood the gosh darned coolest, slickest man in history. The story explodes into an epic 3 + hour (extended cut) film about three man of completely different personalities, backgrounds, and goals trying to find a hidden treasure by a Civil War soldier and stay alive while basically beating the living daylights out of each other. The film is gritty, bleak, and the three main characters are so watchable that each one could carry their own film.Clint Eastwood...how can you possibly say that name and then try to critique the man's acting. If you looked up the definition of masculine in the dictionary...there his picture would be...probably from this film. Eastwood's raspy voice, his ""doesn't take any crap"" attitude, and completely violent personality (in his characters of course) makes him the best gun fighter in ANY Western. He is the perfect leading man especially for a Western and he had to be THE GOOD in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Eastwood is Eastwood and that is the highest compliment you can give. Lee Van Cleef embodies THE BAD, I mean the man has being a villain down to a science and although he doesn't share a whole lot of screen time with the stars he has his own brand of justice that makes him the perfect villain. In a lot of ways he is the polar opposite of Eastwood. He still has the raspy voice, and the cool demeanor and he has this killer instinct that makes him petrifying to see on screen. But all in all he doesn't get the majority of the story and there is a lot of back story to his character left unexplored. I would have loved to see a sequel or another story where he plays Angel Eyes because it would have great to see him back on screen in this role. And finally I save the best for last. I have found a new absolute favorite screen character in Tuco played by veteran actor Eli Wallach. Tuco is THE UGLY in every way shape and form. His drunken, sarcastic, and annoying personality makes him the real stand out performance in this film. In fact he seems to get the majority of the lines and the screen time as we watch his journey to try and get rich. And on top of that the tumultuous relationship between his off again, on again partner Eastwood's ""Blondie"" as named by Tuco. The two of them start as partners until Eastwood turns on him and leaves him which only makes Tuco seek revenge in a horrible way, one of the great scenes where Tuco forces Eastwood across the desert nearly killing him in the process. But you know that can only mean Eastwood will get the last word and he does. Tuco is amazing. He's hilarious, he's bumbling, but he has fantastic good luck when it comes to getting away and on top of it all despite his humorous character he's not easy to kill or a push over. He's blood thirsty, crafty and skilled as a gun man and a villain. The whole film must be watched for Wallach's Tuco alone.This is my first taste but not my last of Eastwood Westerns and Sergio Leone who apparently is the be all and end all of Action western directors. I have the first two installments of the Man With No Name trilogy fired up in the VCR and ready to go. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly in many ways is not outstanding and yet it has this mysterious quality that just sucks you in and makes it an absolute classic. From the dusty streets of the Western town amidst the brooding Civil War and the front, this film encompasses everything. And you can't mention the film without pointing out that haunting Western theme which almost seems like it's used comically but perhaps that's because it has been used as such in the future. You can't ever start a love for Westerns without seeing this...I have no doubt. And it will permanently go down in my books as one of my favorite Westerns. I will say it didn't need to be as long as it was and perhaps more of a climatic ending would have been nice but it's a classic and you can barely pick it apart. Made on a million bucks and probably 100 times that made back. Just see it!! 8.5/10","

"TheUnknown837-1","26 August 2010","""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is one of the pinnacles of my experiences of a moviegoer. Not only is it my all-time favorite Western and therefore, one of my all-time favorite movies regardless of genre, but is a landmark in the history of cinema itself. First of all, it is proof that oftentimes the simplest ideas are the best ones. The plot is fairly simple: three men try to reach a buried fortune of Army gold coins while the Civil War erupts around them. The story is even simpler and yet the audience gets wrapped around in it as 160 minutes and those 160 minutes just seem to whip by so fast that when the movie does end, we're craving for more. The film is also evidence that the Western is not a dying genre, for this landmark film from Italian director Sergio Leone has aged like wine; time has done nothing to varnish its style and authority. And it is also proof that Spaghetti Westerns, which are low in budget and oftentimes flamboyant and over-the-top, can be art, too.This was the third and final time that Clint Eastwood worked with Sergio Leone. He returns again as the mysterious Man with No Name: a cigar-chugging bounty hunter quick on the draw and minimal in emotions. Here is the pinnacle of the vintage Eastwood as an actor, where he could manufacture a character by doing little other than squinting and hissing some sparse dialogue. Eastwood's in prime form here. The movie also features Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes, a mercenary/bounty hunter/Army colonel, the exact opposite of the warm-hearted character he played in the previous Western ""For a Few Dollars More."" But oddly enough, even though Eastwood gets top billing, the central character is Tuco, played with outstanding charisma and sharp energy by Eli Wallach. Wallach had played bad guys and anti-heroes before, but here as the bumbling, deliberately comical, greedy, self-centered, and yet somehow likable and personable Tuco, he steals the show. The movie stays interesting as these three men change partnerships with each other, whenever it seems convenient and when it'll bring them closer to the 200,000 dollars in stolen coins. These three characters, wonderfully written and acted, are an important column holding this film's roof up.Sergio Leone was very much the David Lean of Italy. He could set up beautiful landscape shots and cinematography tricks like few others could. That's part of the reason why so little can happen for so long and yet the tension mounts higher than most. The way he also contrasts long shots with close-ups and montages it all is sheer brilliance. His timing is also exquisite. He knows how long to go, when to cut, when to produce a long take, when to crop a short one, and so on and so forth.And I cannot leave out Ennio Morricone's music, which is even more famous than the movie itself. His main theme, which has been used in parodies and cultural references for more than forty years, is justifiably famous. But whereas it is usually used in parodies to produce a comical effect, here it fits the mood of the picture down to the bone. There's not a single weak cue of music in this marvelous soundtrack.But what's most remarkable about this movie is that it sustains itself for the entirety of its 160-minute length and throughout most of it, very little happens. There are long stretches - minutes upon minutes - where virtually nothing happens. Oftentimes there isn't any music. It's not just the suspense of waiting for Leone's trademark bursts of action; the cinematography and the montage and the directing are so taut and winded together that the audience cannot even force themselves to look away. And if one seeks proof, they have to look no further than the film's climax. Of course because it's a Western, it will have an obligatory final showdown. But consider this showdown. We have three men facing each other down and it goes on for four minutes. Four minutes and the actors are hardly even moving. The only real movement is the camera, which is locked-down, but montaging amongst what is very nearly static images. Coupled with Ennio Morricone's heart-thumping music, this showdown, where very little happens for so long, comes across as one of the most electrifying climaxes in cinema history. Sure the music helps a lot, but it's the directing by Sergio Leone that really makes this scene so intense.""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is most definitely one of the most important films of all time and it certainly has earned its immortality in the realm of the cinema. It is undoubtedly the greatest Spaghetti Western of them all and Sergio Leone's masterpiece. The first film is this trilogy, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" was nothing more than an off-beat, but fun remake of ""Yojimbo."" The second film was also entertaining and fun. But the third movie is a masterpiece. Even at a great length of 160 minutes, and having most of it consumed by silence and stillness, the film never falters to goes on for too long. It goes on and when it does at last end, the audience is left craving for more. They can satisfy themselves in two ways: a) seeking out Leone's director's cut, which is about twenty minutes longer and b) watching the movie again, something I have done and will continue to do many, many times.","

"johno-21","24 February 2006","There are hundreds of comments here on this movie and most of them are of high acclaim which comes as no surprise to me. Many have included this in their all-time top 10 films and again it comes as no surprise. With those I agree, this is a great film. There is little I can add that hasn't been said here but I will go back to the beginning. I was a Clint Eastwood fan when I was a kid from his role as Rowdy Yates in Rawhide. When he made the Spaghetti Westerns as they were called, I of course had to see him on the big screen. A Fistfull of Dollars and A Few Dollars More were unlike the typical Hollywood Westerns of the 50's and 60's. Italian and American actors in low budget productions with overdubbed dialog filmed in Spain which was supposed to be Mexico or the US Soutwest. Heavy on style with strange music. Raw realism emerged from this strange brew and I loved them. Then this came out. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Just the title itself was so impressive you knew this was going to go to another level from the first two. And it did. Ennio Morricone's music was so different and wonderfully strange and remains so even today. It was the perfect soundtrack score for this film. Sergio Leone's direction and his story and screenplay along with Luciano Vincenzoni and cinematography by Tonio Delli Colli are superb. A great cast with Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach. Eastwood's Hang Em High and High Plains Drifter that would follow were good but they couldn't top this. I've seen this dozens of times on TV but I haven't seen it on the big screen since it's initial release. This film ran a little long but it didn't matter because this was clearly a masterpiece. And so it remains. I would give this a 10 and highly recommend it. I'd love to see it on the big screen again.","

"Tweetienator","15 August 2020","Sergio Leone is still an unchallenged maestro regarding the Western genre. From time to time I watch his classics and The Good, The Bad & The Ugly is one of those movies that are still captivating and entertaining no matter how many times you already watched the movie. On top, we get those incredible iconic music by Ennio Morricone. Last but not least - of course, the other two movies of the Dollars trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More) belong to every serious movie collection.","

For its time the cinematic atmosphere of comedy, emotion and gritty drama was clearly above average for even now, and the acting skills were brilliant and really added personality.however (and i don't think its cuz I'm a girl) this film just wasn't for me. it was very slowly paced and i didn't manage to follow or care much for the characters stories.that said, i would definitely recommend watching it as its surely one of those films that depends heavily on personal tastes, and judging it as a western just doesn't give it the respect it warrants.","

"damianphelps","5 October 2020","If ever a movie can be defined by its soundtrack then this is it.As a Metallica fan I have heard the Ecstasy of Gold more times than I can imagine, so much that I've come to think that the barking/howling dog is part of the music (it isn't). Only a very few movies can reach the musical heights of GBU (Conan the Barbarian is one that comes to mind).For me only 2 movies in Clint Eastwood's catalogue are better than this, High Plains Drifter and The Outlaw Josey Wales. Both being epic westerns.Its a masterful movie that works in part because if its lack of details (like a name for The Man With No Name) and the pacing. It takes its time to deliver the story and actually makes their quest for gold feel like a quest.This movie should be banned from remakes.","

"Bolesroor","1 April 2009","Long before Clint Eastwood would wince his way into the ham-hock Hall of Fame as Over-Rated Actor and God-Awful Director he was used to perfection by Director Sergio Leone in his spaghetti-Western masterpiece, ""The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly.""This is a film so visually rich it reads more like a novel than a motion picture. Leone gets off on the grit: the beard-stubble, the sun-chapped lips, battered hat-brim and dirty leather boot. Not only is this the greatest Western ever made it may also stand as the greatest visual story ever committed to film. Leone is so genuinely fascinated by this period and its mythology that every frame is full and compelling... action occurs in both sprawling long shots and lightning bursts of quick-cut gunshot. Eli Wallach is amazing as Tuco, the human rodent, and Ennio Morricone's haunting score adds tremendous humanity to the proceedings.I have to admit I am not a fan of most American Westerns... the vast majority of them seemed to be disposable action flicks shot at the same five ranches using the same twelve horses. ""The Good"" elevates the Western to a higher art form than even John Ford or Howard Hawks' greatest films... it would serve as the visual blueprint for almost every Western to follow, and I highly suggest watching the movie with a glass of cool water nearby... you'll be thirsty.The perfect Saturday-afternoon movie (but be sure to watch in Letterbox!) ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly"" is an enduring cinematic classic not to be missed... one of the greats.GRADE: A+","

"moritzherz","4 February 2023","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is not just the best western ever made, it is at least in the top 5 movies of all time. Why? Well, where to start......the storyThis movie has a simple plot: Three guys searching for 200.000 dollars. But what's wring about a simple story? Right, absolutely NOTHING. Especially if it's so good working like in this film. All three characters have unique trait marks that play a big role during the 2 hours 50. And lets talk about this rather long running time. You won't feel the lenght at all! There is not a single moment I felt bored and the pacing is very slow. And because of that slow pacing the finale is even more satisfying.One of the most tenseful moments of cinema history: The Showdown. And that leds me to......the musicEnnio Morricone. One name. More shouldn't I have to say. The man, the legend, master of his profession. Just the music during The Showdown is enough to say that without his music the movie would be easily one point lower rated. There is little music that everybody can identify easier with a whole genre than his. But he is just the first of the three legends that created this movie's legacy. Lets focus on......the directingSergio Leone. Without this guy the western genre would just consist of John Waynes movies and a few unknown. The genre would not have become this important as it was. The unique style of his directing build a whole new subgenre: The italo-western. When watching his movies you know that he made them, the emotions of the characters are depicted in a way never seen before. Just look at the showdown scene. It's brilliant. But of course this is only possible because of the third person that defined the movie. Let's talk about.......the actingClint Eastwood. Is there anybody who don't know this man? His unique performave as the man without a name during all three movies of the dollar trilogy is a masterpiece of it's own. When I think about a cowboy the image of Clint Eastwood is in front of my eyes. This guy defined the genre like no other (even John Wayne) and is one of the best actors Hollywood has ever seen. This guy is a phenomenon!So let's summarize that, you have a powerful story with one of the greatest finales of all time, the trio of perfection giving you masterclass music, directing and acting and 2 hours and 50 minutes full of entertaining.It's hard to beat that, it may even impossible to top that. I rarely give a ten out of ten, because that means perfection, but this movie is perfection so there is no other choice.Go watch it, everybody should do it, because if you die without watching it, you missed something big, very big you missedIl Masterpiece.","

"weezeralfalfa","19 May 2019","I submit that my review title is a more accurate descriptor of the 3 stars than the given film title. Clint Eastwood, as ""Blondie"", may be the justified ultimate victor, but I see little in him that is good. I don't like westerns with too much gun play, and too many corpses piling up. There is an abundance of both here, some justified, some not. Blondie, on several occasions just mows down a bunch of people for no reason. He tries to get extra bounty money by collaborating with escaped Mexican bandit Tuco(Eli Wallach), to deliver him to peace officers in exchange for a bounty reward, which he would later share with Tuco, after he had cut the suspending rope tied around Tuco's neck with a gun shot. Tuco would ride off on the horse he was sitting on. When they reconvened, they went to the next town and tried the same trick. But something was bound to go wrong eventually. So, Tuco stuck up Blondie and made him walk a long way across a desert with no water, and no protection from the sun. When Blondie was virtually dead, they came upon a closed wagon full of dead or nearly dead bodies. While Tuco is getting water for the one barely alive man, this man tells Blondie the name on the grave where a fortune in gold is hidden. Blondie tells Tuco he knows the relevant grave site, but not which graveyard it's in. Tuco then gives Blondie some water and shade, and they agree to eventually share the 2 parts of the puzzle..........After they have found the cache of gold coins, Blondie, not trusting Tuco, ties his hands behind his back, fashions a hanging rope, has him stand on a rickety grave cross, and puts the noose around his neck. Blondie leaves Tuco's share of gold at his feet, then rides off. Responding to Tuco's pleading, Blondie turns around , and from some distance, breaks the rope with a single shot, thus completing this redundant gag, after which Blondie continues to ride off into the sunset, while Tuco is left in this bleak waterless desert, with his hands tied behind his back,, and no horse. This was Blondie's way of extracting revenge for several transgressions of Tuco. Tuco had nearly succeeded in hanging Blondie, except for a traumatic interruption. Also, for Tuco nearly killing him by making him walk across that waterless desert. Tuco showed his sadistic side by tempting Blondie with some water, then throwing it away. Also, Tuco had tried to get to the relevant grave before Blondie, after Blondie told him where it was. Crafty Blondie told him wrong in case he had the idea to make off with all the gold. .......The occasional switch between 2 of the 3 main characters being reluctant buddies to being outright enemies is an important factor in making this an interesting western.........Angel Eyes(Lee Van Cleef) has some encounters with the other two relating to finding the treasure. At last, Blondie writes the name of the relevant grave on a rock(?), and places it in middle of a triangle formed by the 3 men. A three-way duel ensues. Blondie shoots Angel Eyes dead, and previously unloaded Tuco's gun. Thus, he is the winner, sparing Tuco's life, for the present, and awarding him half the gold, but as I previously described, Blondie imposes severe restrictions of Tuco's ability to make use of all that gold...........I think the film could have been tightened by about 30min.,to make it seem less daunting. The 3 main actors did an excellent job. Incidentally, Eastwood was a non-smoker, thus objected to having a cigarillo in the corner of his mouth in nearly every scene. However, this did contribute to his charisma.","

Now, as as far as Clint's westerns go, I much prefer The Outlaw Josey Wales and my all time favorite movie Unforgiven to this. Granted, this is only a personal preference mind you. Even so, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is a tremendous film and the biggest and best of The Dollars Trilogy. This is a true artist at the top of his game with a truly unique take on the Western genre that is an unforgettable cinematic epic that was a game changer for westerns and movies in general. The film still looks great and while there were lots of spaghetti westerns that would follow, no one did it like Sergio Leone.","

I'm going to make each one of my kids watch it when they get to be like 10 years old. It's a film that absolutely captures the essence of what life is all about. There really are only three types of people out there, and the three characters in this film are complete, yet simple, portraits of those three types.The hairs on my arms stand up every time I watch this film, especially during the final scene. Sergio Leone knows how to build a scene. Ennio Morricone's music is absolutely perfect with this film. It's hard to think of a movie with a better soundtrack actually.To summarize: brilliant, breathtaking, mesmerizing...and like a fine wine, this one just gets better and better.

"neil-476","17 February 2014","There's this fellow with no name who is hanging around with a ne'er do well called Tuco - No Name collects a reward for Tuco then, just as they are about to hang Tuco, No Name shoots the rope and they escape. This scam serves them quite well until a stolen army payroll enters the equation at which point, together with a ferrety-faced individual, the three of them find themselves reluctant allies and less reluctant antagonists as, against a backdrop of the Civil War, they try to track down the payroll.Let me set out the bits which I would quibble with. The Spanish locations - undoubtedly photogenic - don't look even slightly like the places they are supposed to represent. The dubbing on the non-English speaking cast has some places where the English speech is hopelessly out of synchronisation with the mouth movements of the cast members. And, sad to say, it does ramble somewhat.So what is good about it? Well, Ennio Morricon's score is wonderful, and I don't just mean the seminal theme: it is full of haunting melody and dramatic arrangements. The set pieces are brilliantly staged, especially the bridge sequence and the entire closing section. Plus, notwithstanding that this is his third appearance, it is an education to see Eastwood's seminal character cemented into iconhood, especially as his costume is assembled bit by bit throughout the film.Take no notice of my quibbles! It is a classic!","

"Kirpianuscus","19 July 2020","First, for a long time, it was the music of Ennio Moriccone. Obsessive, preserving , like a flavor, the essence of the story. The second - Lee Van Cleef. And, sure, the great job of Eli Wallach. I am not an admirer of western genre and I saw this film few couple days ago. The last virtue, not the least remains the fine refference to the Civil War, smart, precise, real useful. The basic scene - the first. It is a film with many admirers , a classic and more than te familiar western. But its virtue , the great virtue , is to be the perfect caleidoscope. A good film, maybe a masterpiece, for many reasons, many , so different categories of public, in impecable craft, with a powerful message. The humor, the tension and, yes, especially the high inspired sound are the great - unique , in my opinion, motifs to see, time by time, this splendid film.","

"FightingWesterner","11 November 2011","Absolutely irresistible, The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly is both the quintessential spaghetti western and the ultimate film from director Sergio Leone (not to mention one of the most popular westerns of all time), though For A Few Dollars More and Once Upon A Time In The West are pretty hard to beat. Needless to say, it's hard to talk about this without repeating the same praise others have heaped on this film.Strangely enough, for something that's become known as one of the definitive Clint Eastwood vehicles, the real main character (as far as the script is concerned) is Eli Wallach's Tuco Ramirez. It's through the eyes of Tuco that most of the action is witnessed and all of the character development takes place. As flashy as their roles are, Eastwood's ""man with no name"" and Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes seen almost cardboard by comparison.When it comes to deleted and extended scenes, I find myself (surprisingly) in agreement with United Artists' studio hucksters from way back when. Added scenes are either unnecessary and awkward, like the introduction of Tuco's gang, or they interrupt the flow of the story, like Angel Eyes' trip to the pitiful rebel camp. It's much more effective to watch Van Cleef disappear after his encounter with Bill Carson's woman and become almost forgotten, only to reappear at the Confederate prisoner-of-war camp, in time to get in on the action.One surprise that awaits those who've seen the movie multiple times and then listened to Ennio Morricone's soundtrack album, is that the climactic showdown theme Il Triello (the trio) differs substantially on the album from the take used in the final film, with the movie version featuring a callback to the musical pocket watch in For A Few Dollars More and the album version containing an extended horn solo at the end, lasting longer than in the film.","

Only Joe knows the name of the grave, therefore there is a great dispute between the two gunmen, but always keeping Joe alive. This is a really classic western movie. This movie has never been released on VHS in Brazil, and only now the distributor Fox do Brasil' released on DVD format. I am a great fan of Sergio Leone, and the first DVD I bought for my collection was 'Once Upon the Time in America'. 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is great in all aspects: the story is very funny, the actors have great performances, and the soundtrack from Enio Morricone is unforgettable: it is certainly one of the most beautiful and known in the cinema history.

"BA_Harrison","28 May 2015","'The Good' is sharp-shooter Blondie (Clint Eastwood), although how someone who runs a bounty racket, betrays his friend, and shoots numerous people dead can be deemed good is beyond me. Bandit Tuco (Eli Wallach) is 'The Ugly', which I think is a little unfair to the bloke: he's no George Clooney, but he's not Quasimodo either. That leaves cold-hearted killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) as 'The Bad', which he most definitely is, even going so far as to kill a child in order to achieve his goals. After Blondie and Tuco chance upon a dying Confederate soldier who reveals to them the whereabouts of a fortune in gold, the pair come to the attention of Angel Eyes, who will do anything to lay his hands on the treasure.The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, the third film in Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy, is an epic spaghetti western that benefits from iconic central characters, an undeniable sense of cool, and, of course, that classic Ennio Morricone soundtrack (Waaawawah, waa waa waa!). Where the film doesn't fare quite so well is in the pacing and storytelling, the basic plot—three guys go in search of hidden treasure—stretched painfully thin, particularly in the Extended Cut, which clocks in at approximately three hours. The expansive historical backdrop—the American Civil War—frequently detracts from the flow of the story and Leone has a tendency to labour a little too much over his style, lingering on his characters for an eternity and repeating similar shots ad nasueum, all of which causes scenes to drag. Fortunately, some nice touches of humour and a couple of neat plot twists help to make matters a little easier to digest.6/10. Not quite as hard-going as Once Upon A Time In The West, but not a patch on the earlier Dollars movies, or indeed, Leone's underrated A Fistful of Dynamite.","

Clint Eastwood was good as usual. Shooting locations are brilliant and the supportive background score is very catchy. The movie is a bit slow in the beginning, but once it catches pace, it deeply involves the audience. Some people have argued that #4 is too high for this movie, but its not 'some' who make the IMDb list, its the majority. Speaking of Leone, I believe that he was at least 15-20 years ahead of time.

In my opinion this is the greatest and most stylish western ever made. With a superb mix of action, adventure and drama and not forgetting the humour.The cinematography is brilliantly captivating (will the great mix of flashy camera angles), the music score is downright dynamic & undoubtedly absorbing and the backdrop of the film is simply breath taking.This is one truly drawn-out western film that feels so surreal at times. It runs for just under three hours, the pace of the film is quite good for a very long film, as Leone's direction is really top-notch that it just doesn't seem to matter as this film is really compelling and dense that you could watch it over and over again and it would still seem fresh.The performances are excellent, Clint Eastwood as the quietly spoken Blondie (the good), Eli Wallach as the humorous Tuco (the ugly) and Lee Van Cleef as the menacing Angel Eyes (the bad). Whenever the three share the screen it's thoroughly imposing and intriguing, though that's greatest thing it doesn't just focus on Eastwood's character- but it has another two strong leads.The story is tremendously set in the background of the American Civil war, with its twists and turns, comedic touches between Blondie and Tuco, powerful images and great shoot-outs.Wow, what a spectacular movie this is by Sergio Leone. A defiant must see for movie lovers.5/5","

An exceptional achievement whose influence transcends the world of filmmaking, it also is notable for featuring the greatest climax ever filmed in cinema history. An unmistakable, indisputable & unforgettable classic.","

"filipemanuelneto","4 June 2023","I'm not an expert nor do I want to sound like one, but I think this is one of the most famous western films ever made, despite being shot by an Italian director and being more European than American. Sérgio Leone was one of the most notable directors of his time and he left us, in this film, one of his masterpieces.This is one of those movies that is almost perfect. Problems and failures are scarce and reside in minimal details that end up not making a big difference in the overall work. The story was very well written and takes place in the midst of the American Civil War, a time when violence was part of everyday life. In this environment of violence and mutual distrust, two men are looking for a treasure buried in a cemetery: the problem is the fact that each one knows only part of the location (that is, one knows the location of the cemetery and the other knows which grave it is) and there is a third man, a fearsome assassin, willing to do anything to take all the gold.For this film, Leone put together a very reasonable cast, mostly European, and three great North American actors with enormous talent: Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. I believe that they knew how to make the most intelligent and skilful use of this film, giving us a truly remarkable job. For this three actors, this is the best cinematographic work of their career, or one of the best, consecrating them as great Western movies actors. The film, however, seems to give Wallach more and better opportunities. While watching it, I got the feeling that he is the actor who receives most attention and best material, in addition to having known how to improvise at the right moments and in creative and intelligent ways.The film has great visual beauty, emphasized by the cinematography, the filming work and the good choice and design of sets and costumes. At a time when the correct period recreation was something that cinema sometimes blatantly ignored, this film did the opposite, giving us a realistic and believable vision of the past and placing the film in a specific place and time. I'm not saying it was a one hundred percent successful effort, but it was definitely a decisive step in the right direction when it comes to period films. The special effects and visuals are excellent, the best there was then, and the whole film has an epic, grandiose, expensive feel. It is also very long, with almost three hours in length, but it is worth not being afraid or giving up on because of that. Being a Western film, it is quite evident that there is a lot of violence, so it is not a film for children. Even so, it is not gratuitous violence. Finally, we owe Ennio Morricone a salute for the excellent soundtrack he composed. Among his vast work, this is not my favorite nor the best, but it is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable and iconic pieces, a work that we know, even without having seen this film, and that has become part of our collective memory. We can't ask for more than that.","

"CuriosityKilledShawn","23 January 2012","In the last of the so-called 'Dollars' trilogy Eastwood now plays a man called Blondie (despite clearly having brown hair) who has hooked up with Tuco, a bandit with an amusingly long list of crimes, to run a reward-and-release scam with various towns and cities across the Old West. Soon tiring of Tuco's behavior, Blondie ends their volatile partnership and heads off on his own.Angered by the double-cross, Tuco exacts a laborious revenge on Blondie, but just as the punishment reaches its zenith under a burning hot sun in a remote part of the desert a wagon carrying dead Confederate soldiers interrupts. With his last breath, the sole surviving Rebel tells Tuco of a stash of treasure buried in a cemetery, and, while Tuco is distracted, tells Blondie what grave it is buried under. Their difficult partnership is quickly restored as they trek across the West, through Civil War conflicts, towards the treasure.So far I've only covered the Good and Ugly. The Bad just so happens to be Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless mercenary who has also learned of the hidden loot and eventually crosses paths with his rivals. He has the least screen time, but is necessary as a pure villain to lessen the crude vulgarity of Tuco.It's a long film. But it's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and Sergio Leone allows himself plenty of time and space to indulge in quirky idiosyncrasies. I especially like Tuco having a bubble bath in the midst of his current location being blown to smithereens.Villains always interest me, and actors mostly choose villains over heroes as they make for better characters. Blondie may comfort dying soldiers and play with kittens, but he's just too bland. Angel Eyes, is hardcore, and a better character, but he's nothing compared to Tuco. Eli Wallach owns this film, and takes most of the screen time away from Eastwood and Van Cleef. The scene where he searches the cemetery, as the camera spins around and around and around has such a beautiful innocence to it. Even though Tuco may have killed and robbed many this scene makes him seem like an easily excitable child at heart. It's absolutely wonderful.If you've got an evening free, and just don't know how to spend 3 otherwise empty hours, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is a fine way to spend them.","

"gluttony14","19 January 2006","This movie is a classic. It's spectacular, it's thrilling, it's beautiful. You won't find anything like this now-a-days, no matter how hard you try. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should be ashamed of himself.The plot is simple - Blondie (Clint Eastwood), the Good, Tuco (Eli Wallach), the Ugly, and Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), the Bad, are all after a stash of Confederate gold, holding 200,000 dollars in gold, during the American Civil War. Seems like a pretty simple plot for 1 and a half hours, let alone 3. So what drives this movie? Style. Cinematography. Atmosphere. Let me explain.The first scene in the movie is the (rather unappealing) face of a bandit. It then switches to a wide shot of the small town he and his two companions are entering. A few more shots of the bandits. They enter an inn, and gunshots are heard. Out the window comes charging Tuco, clutching a gun in one hand and meat in the other. The image freezes while he's in midair, and the writing ""The Ugly"" appears on the screen. The first half hour or so serves to introduce the three main characters in similar fashion. No plot progression whatsoever, merely introduction. Most movies would fall with a start like that, but not this one. It takes more than an hour before the rush for the gold begins, and by that hour you already know everything you can and need to know about the three anti-heroes: Blondie is the Good. He is not good at all under normal standards, as he is an outlaw, a killer and he betrays his ""friend"". But he seems good in comparison to the other slime-balls in the movie: Tuco is a villain, pure and simple. He steals, murderers, rapes, and does a bunch of other nasty things. But he is still fun and amusing, while the sinister Angel Eyes stands in comparison - a menacing figure in black clothing with an evil mustache, who kills and double-crosses without blinking for a few more dollars.And the movie doesn't follow a plot. The plot is just a background for the amazing scenes that come one after another and construct the movie - you go from one scene to the other. And there are many memorable scenes in this movie: The first time Blondie shoots the rope before Tuco is hanged to death. Blondie's march through the desert. Tuco and Blondie's capture by the Yankees. Tuco's torture. Tuco's gunfight in the tub and the classic line that follows. The showdown in the deserted town. The bridge being blown up. Tuco's search for the grave. And of course, the amazing climax. But I'll get to that later.We've covered the style, but I also mentioned cinematography and atmosphere. And the cinematography is amazing. Wide shots of towns and deserts zoom to close-ups of desperate and rugged men. The effect is amazing, especially during gunfights. It creates tension and suspense, and that leads me to the second point I mentioned: atmosphere. This feels like the West. The people look dirty and hard-working. The buildings look rickety. And when time is spent looking at each other before the guns are drawn for a few short seconds when the men fire at each other, you feel what it's like to be there.And finally, as I mentioned before, the climax. Possibly the best climax in a movie ever. A Mexican Standoff between the three main characters in the film - Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tuco. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Minutes pass as they stare at each other, each bringing their hand a bit closer to the gun. The music becomes more and more dramatic as time passes. You wait, and then... They fire, and it's over. A duel as a duel should be. It's mind-blowing.Few movies can reach the level of this masterpiece. Fewer still can surpass it. They don't make 'em like this anymore, and it's a damn shame.","

"ironhorse_iv","22 April 2014","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is just amazing to watch. I'm watching the 2004 extended version, with all the delete scenes in it. Directed by Sergio Leone, this movie is the third film in the Dollars Trilogy following 1964's A Fistful of Dollars and 1965's For a Few Dollars More, serving as a prequel to them. Thank Goodness, the movie wasn't call 'The Two Magnificent Tramps', its working title. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, River of Dollars, or The Man with No Name, but decided on The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The title, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly suite the plot so well. The plot revolves around three gunslingers, 'the Good' AKA 'Brodie' AKA 'The Man with no name (Clint Eastwood), 'The Bad' AKA 'Angel Eyes' (Lee Van Cleef) and 'The Ugly"" Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez (Eli Wallach). All three are competing to find a fortune in buried Confederate gold during the American Civil War. All the actors in this film are great. Clint Eastwood is great. I love that the producers finally explain where his character got his trademark poncho. Granted, the other two were morally worse than him, but Blondie's not exactly a nice guy, too. It's more like 'the good enough'. I love, how Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach work with each other. Lots of chemistry there, yet a lot of backstabbing triathlon with the trio. Tuco is the only one of the trio, the audience really gets to know all about. We meet his brother and find out where he came from and why he became a bandit. The other two are more of a mysteries. The names ""Blondie"" and ""Angel Eyes"" aren't exactly threatening, but workable. Blondie's hair is sandy brown. This is due to imperfect translation from the original Italian. Mad props to Eli Wallach for doing all the dangerous stunts as he almost got killed in real life like three times during the making of this movie. Eli Wallach pretty much steals the movie with his character. Originally, Leone wanted Charles Bronson to play Angel Eyes but he was already committed to another movie, and Leone choose Lee Van Cleef as the villain, playing opposite to the character, he plays in the 'For a Few Dollars More'. I glad, Lee Van Cleef was chosen for the film. He was best as the villain. Still, it does get kinda confusing, story wise seeing how the films are supposedly connect to each other. In the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco as The Bad. This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates literally to ""The Good, the Ugly, the Bad"". Still, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly had tons of memorable lines, funny scenes, and epic action, but the movie is really long. It takes forever to get to the buried treasure part of the movie, even if you watching a way cut down version. Angel Eyes besides the opening, doesn't show up, until half way to the film. Lots of desert scenes that they add in the 2004 version was cut out for a good reason. The movie takes a lot of side steps missions like blowing a strategic bridge, bounty hunters, and money-schemes that were entertaining, but kinda distracting as the gold plot takes a backseat, most of the first act and second. The movie has a great sweeping widescreen cinematography by Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli. The Cemetery showdown is intense. I love how the movie is shot with all the dramatic extreme close ups to give the audience, a sense of tensed. The movie got tense, due to falling out between Leone and Clint Eastwood, as Eastwood got tired of all the camera shooting in different angles, sweeping long shots, and extreme close ups. Both never work together again, after this. I can see why Eastwood might had got upset. There is a bit too much artsy in the film, but it's not too bad. Many of Leone's trademarks, hugely influential to modern filmmakers. Unlike A Fistful of Dollars nor For a Few Dollars More, this film had a bigger budget and its shows. Mad props to the people had to build the bridge in the blowing up scene, it had to be filmed and build twice due to the camera being destroy in the first shot. Another to the crew building a cemetery, just for the Sad Hill shootout scene. The money was well-used. I love the Civil War theme. The theme shows how brutal the backdrop, the Civil War was during that time and how absurd it was. The dubbing on my version was really good. Love the Curse Cut Beep. Ennio Morricone composed the soundtrack. The main theme is turned into one for each protagonist: The Good's has a whistle, The Bad's an ocarina, and The Ugly's screamed. It works so well. 'Story of a soldier' is beautiful. It's eerily in a way, since it play during the torture scene. I also love the score, Ecstasy of Gold. It's haunting at the beginning, it draws you in, slowly. Then it smacks you in the face like a ton of bricks and voila! Depending on what version, you're watching this movie. It can take from 161 min to 186 min. The 186 minute is dubbed. If you find the 2002 extended, it's in English, but cut to 179 min. Then you have an old copy, like the 1984's version, its 142, but its cut as hell. In my opinion, just get the 2004 DVD. Tons of special features on the behind the scene production, documentaries, and additional footages like too badly damaged film negative. All of them are worth the price of 2004 DVD. Overall: One of the best cinematic film. Worth watching if haven't yet saw.","

"ewarn-1","14 February 2007","When I was a kid, nobody liked westerns. Our fathers had fought in the Korean War, and the astronauts were racing in space. Cowboys seemed old, dusty, and boring. Then along came three guys to change all that. One was good, the other bad, the other ugly. Or maybe they all had those three characteristics in them. But they arrived at one hell of a showdown, and it changed things.This is not just an action filled western, but a sweeping commentary on the American character, as witnessed by an objective outsider. His aim was true.By the mid 60s, the western formula, and perhaps the action film itself, had become too stale and conventional to evoke any enthusiastic response. Leone gave us not just a new perspective on film violence, but for the first time a director blended the most fascinating elements of American history, both mythical and real, into a traditional western story.The storyline, involving three untitled men propelled by avarice into uncivilized territory, could serve as a fable for the expansion of the American frontier. Against the sun-blasted background we see the elements that have shaped, in different ways, the essential American character: warfare, technology, weapons, hardened individualism. Previous western films might have explored related themes, but never with the exciting visual style shown in this one.The characters are men we really have never seen before. They are enigmatic, inscrutable, and fascinating to look at. Leone leaves their pasts unmarked so we can eagerly fill in their backgrounds on our own. As their journey in pursuit of lucre ends, we are presented with the best showdown in the history of the western. The quest, exciting as it was, culminates in one of the best endings in movie history.The score of course is famous in itself but welded to the fascinating visuals and characters it becomes one for the ages. Amazing it took an Italian director filming in Spain to make the essential ""American"" western film. You don't like westerns? I urge you to try this and see things from an outsider's point of view. His aim was true.","

"ackstasis","2 March 2010","This week I was fortunate enough to see 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (1966)' (namely, the 2003 extended English-language version) in the cinema, perhaps the only place that Sergio Leone's classic Spaghetti Western can be properly appreciated. This was my second viewing – the first being in 2006, when my interest in cinema was still in its infancy – and, just as Leone's film gained status only in subsequent decades, my admiration has since grown substantially. By the early 1960s, the Western had become a tired genre, and even the best American entries {such as Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)'} could more closely be described as somber rather than thrilling. Leone's low-budget Italian productions breathed new life into the Western, the director's highly-stylised (and purely cinematic) film-making style tackling the recently-emerged Revisionist Western sub-genre with a cheekily-parodic sense of humour.Though 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' clearly identifies each of its three protagonists with a titular adjective, the separating lines are decidedly blurred. Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is the archetypal anti-hero, a laconic, cigar-smoking bounty-hunter who makes every word, and every bullet, count. Tuco (Eli Wallach) is a slimy opportunist, a bottom-dweller whose unabashed enthusiasm – especially opposite the apathetic Eastwood – makes him an oddly-likable character. Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) is a crafty, intelligent schemer, greed and contempt mixing behind those cold, steely eyes. Leon's film revolves almost exclusively around these three characters, and the American Civil War is utilised purely as a historical backdrop. As was the director's style, the film is a triumph of contrasts: an epic period of American history is used merely as a stage for an intimate battle-of-wills between three determined men with their own selfish aims.Contrast, too, is evident through Leone's camera lens. Few directors (perhaps David Lean or Sergei Bondarchuk are his only true rivals in this field) have more inspiringly utilised the cinema screen as a canvas. Leone switches between landscapes and portraits, at times cutting unexpectedly from a distant long-shot to an extreme close-up of Eastwood's sweaty brow, his eyes narrowed and alert. I wrote in my review for 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' that that Leone's landscape was the human face. Unlike Ford, to whom setting was significant (one reason why he so adored Monument Valley), Leone's Westerns unfold in an anonymous landscape, dry and unremarkable and unforgiving. Colour is instead injected through Ennio Morricone's score, perhaps the most memorable ever composed for a film. The composer's contribution is uniquely cinematic, refusing to linger in the background and instead serving to overwhelm and enhance Leone's imagery.","

"estebangonzalez10","17 September 2010","¨You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend, those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig.¨ I wonder what would've been of Clint Eastwood's career if it weren't for the ¨Dollars¨ trilogy. Before working with Italian filmmaker, Sergio Leone, he had a career as a television actor in Rawhide, a western based TV series, but he couldn't get a decent job in Hollywood so he began to look for work abroad. He reached international success thanks to Leone's reinvented spaghetti westerns: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966), known as the ¨Dollars¨ trilogy. He proved producers wrong because they thought that people wouldn't pay to see movies of actors they could see for free on television, but audiences were more than willing to see him in the big screen. His pairing with Leone couldn't have worked out better for him since the director's trademark was combining long wide shots with extreme close-ups. These wide shots couldn't have been enjoyed as much on the small television sets at home. Eastwood's rough features and manly charisma also contributed to Leone's success, and both seemed destined to work with each other. There is no need to see the previous ¨Dollars¨ movies as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly stands out on its own and is actually a prequel since the movie takes place during the Civil War in the early 1860's before the other plots take place and they are all separate stories that only have Clint Eastwood's character in common. When I see Eastwood's latest films as a director I can't help but think how much he was influenced by the great Sergio Leone. He must have learned a great deal working with the Italian director in this masterpiece. It is just shot beautifully and to perfection by Leone, the cinematography and scenery are amazing and feel real, and the score is perfect. Eastwood may be a different director than Leone was, but he pays close detail to his craft and also knows how to shoot beautifully.The plot is pretty simple for a movie that is about three hours long, but Leone's use of the camera and extended shots makes the film longer. He also adds several side stories that work really well in the narrative. The film begins by introducing each character (although in the opposite order: The Ugly, The Bad, and The Good). The film begins with an extreme close up on a bounty hunter (Al Mulock) and then when we see the wide shot there are three of them who are quietly entering a bar. Once the men enter we hear three shots and out comes Tuco, also known as The Ugly (Eli Wallach), who escapes. In the next scene we are introduced to The Bad, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), who is tracking down a peasant farmer. The scene is truly a classic as no words are spoken for about ten minutes, but the tension can be felt. Angel Eyes is actually looking for information on the location of a treasure of coins lost during the Civil War and he is told a soldier named Bill Carson has it. Finally, we are introduced to Blondie, The Good (Clint Eastwood), who saves Tuco from a group of men who want to turn him in because there is a reward on his head. Blondie saves him only to collect the reward himself, but once Tuco is about to be hanged he shoots the rope and sets him free as part of a scam in which they divide the money. They later turn against each other only to discover the location of the treasure that has been buried and the race begins to see who can get to the treasure first as the three men have different information regarding its whereabouts.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is my all-time favorite Western. Any other film in the genre will always be measured by its standards. The opening scene in which we are introduced to Angel Eyes (The Bad) is just so beautifully shot that no dialogue was needed and we were already hooked (Ennio Morricone's amazing score can also take some credit for that). The first ten minutes have no dialogue whatsoever but it sets up the general tone of the movie: several wide shots where we can see the great landscape and deserts combining them with extreme close ups of the characters facial expressions, the tension and suspense is built with long and slow scenes and suddenly the violence happens so quickly that we are caught off guard. The film doesn't celebrate violence, it portrays it truthfully. The main character is the quiet Blondie (The Good), but without a doubt Tuco (The Ugly) is the one who has the most lines and brings some unbalance and goofiness to an otherwise serious picture. One of the funniest scenes is when he is in the tub and one of the bounty hunter shows up to kill him but before shooting he begins the classic speech villains tend to give and Tuco pulls out his gun and fires at him saying, ¨When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk.¨ Tuco plays a key role and his character is kind of the gray in an otherwise black (Angel Eyes) and white (Blondie), good guy and bad guy western movie. He breaks the conventionality in the genre. The final Mexican standoff scene is also truly memorable and one of the best shot sequences. This is a truly unique film that has stood the test of time; it catapulted Eastwood into a movie star, and has influenced him on his way to becoming a great director. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is one of my all time favorite movies and is a must see film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","

"valleyjohn","5 February 2009","It's surprising how your memory can play tricks on you. Having watched many westerns in my childhood i could have sworn that i had seen The Good , The Bad and the Ugly . Surely everyone of a certain age has? Well as it turns out i probably hadn't , or if i had i remember nothing of it. This is the final film of the Sergio Leone "" ""Dollars"" or "" man with no name"" trilogy of which i have been watching recently and although this is the most famous of the three ' for me it's not quite the best . Blondie (The Good) and Tuco (The Ugly) are con artists, trying to steal as much money as possible during the Civil War. Angel Eyes (The Bad) is trying to locate a bank robber going by the name of Bill Carson, in order to collect his stolen gold. After a few scams, Blondie cheats Tuco by keeping his share and leaving him in the dust.Tuco eventually finds Blondie and drags him off into the desert, torturing him in revenge. Then they run into Bill Carson, who tells Tuco the location of a graveyard where his stolen gold is buried. As Tuco looks for water to keep Carson alive long enough to help more, Carson tells Blondie which gravestone marks the buried gold, and dies before he can say more. Angel Eyes soon figures out that they know, and all three want a 50% share of the gold, but only two of them will get it.The amazing thing about this superb trilogy is that they all were made within three years. Each movie having it's budget increased. A fistful of dollars - 200K . A few Dollars more - 600K and finally the good , The bad and the ugly 1.1m. In the latter it really shows that leone had a lot more money to spend. Lavish sets , a huge amount of personnel and no doubt an increased salary for the ever popular Clint Eastwood and Lee Van cleef but as any movie fan will tell you an increased budget does not always make a better film .I have no doubt which is my favourite of the trilogy and that is "" A few dollars More"" . It is the perfect western. This film is not, simply because it's trying to do too much. It's an hour too long and the plot drifts off in different directions. Sure it has all the superb hallmarks of a Sergio Leone western. It looks amazing , it has a wonderful soundtrack and it finishes with typical tense showdown but it's the bits inbetween namely the civil war scenes that distract from what should have been an amazing western. Angel eyes , the lee van Cleef's character is not engaging enough and i would have loved to have seen him return as Col. Douglas Mortimer who we saw in the previous film instead we get a character who is given third billing behind Blondie and Tuco. In fact the best character is Tuco ' who is played by Eli Wallach and he gets the vast majority of the screen time.This lacks the brutality of the previous films and maybe that is because Sergio Leone was going for that wider audience. 8 out of 10","

"alexismaria02","10 May 2020","""The good, the bad and the ugly"" is nothing but a masterpiece. From its start to its astonishing ending, this film gives me chills every time i watch it. It truly doesn't matter if you are a Western fan or not, this film will capture you from the first few seconds. It is full of action, and not that kind of mainstream action, but the kind of action that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the whole picture!
From the excellent soundtrack by the great Ennio Morricone to Sergio Leone's unique direction, this film stands out from the rest. Clint Eastwood gives yet another magnificent performance that in my opinion, has changed cinema. Every scene is shot so beautiful that it makes you ""live"" with the well-sculpted characters.
To conclude, ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" is one of those few films that managed to shape cinema throughout its long history. If you haven't watched it yet, you should definitely give it a go asap!!","

"rjwilton","7 December 2009","One of the best depictions of war, and one of the best anti-war films. The best gunfight ever filmed. Consistently witty, often moving, brutally realistically ugly, and one of the most beautiful films ever shot, set to one of the most beautiful scores. The 'spaghetti' label on the can means that these westerns will never get the consideration and respect they deserve. If you fancy thinking a little differently about 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly', try the following. Look past Clint Eastwood's legend-founding performance and suppose that the central character is actually Eli Wallach's Tuco, the Ugly. A gross rogue, guilty of every possible vice, Tuco is after all the character we see and hear the most, about whom we learn the most, and through whom we experience much of the action. Eli Wallach makes him comic, poignant, and plausible - certainly compared to the unrestrained darkness of Lee Van Cleef and the impossible cool of Eastwood. The film is largely Tuco's struggle to survive, and to earn a little on the side, constantly battered between Eastwood's ""blond Angel"" and Van Cleef's angel of death. Angels? Indeed: Tuco is ultimately human, and Tuco is all of us - grubby, corrupt, uncomfortable and slightly desperate humans, veering between the good and the bad, subject to a perplexing God and an unrelenting Devil, and just trying to muddle along.","

"RNMorton","26 November 1999","And maybe even more in this story of an uneasy (to say the least) alliance between Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach, both in search of hidden gold. It doesn't help that Lee Van Cleef, and boy is he an evil one with a lot of attitude, is also out there looking. Film is quite long, but the non-stop action, Wallach's performance, and rich Civil War backdrop distinguish this one from Clint's earlier Spaghetti Westerns. In fact, this is just about the only one of that genre that I can stand at this point; I saw Once Upon a Tine in the West not too long ago and missed the point entirely. Final showdown is deservingly legendary, as is the musical score. 10 out of 10","

"Hildebrando_Martins_Almeida","16 July 2023","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) is an epic Italian Western directed by Sergio Leone that has become a milestone in the genre and one of the most influential films in cinema history. Starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach, the movie presents a captivating story set during the American Civil War, where three gunslingers compete to find a fortune in stolen gold.One of the film's distinctive features is Leone's ability to create visually stunning sequences. His wide cinematography and use of wide shots and close-ups establish a tense and captivating atmosphere. Additionally, Ennio Morricone's masterfully composed soundtrack enhances the unique cinematic experience, with its instantly recognizable and iconic main theme.The screenplay, written by Agenore Incrocci, Furio Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni, Sergio Leone, and Sergio Donati (uncredited), is skillfully crafted, presenting a narrative filled with twists and complex characters. The three protagonists, known as ""the Good,"" ""the Bad,"" and ""the Ugly,"" are portrayed masterfully by Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach, respectively. Each brings their character to life in a memorable way, with Eastwood, in particular, solidifying his position as an icon of the genre.The impact of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly on the Western genre is undeniable. While the film is part of Leone's Dollars Trilogy, it goes beyond the boundaries of the spaghetti Western and becomes a masterpiece of cinema as a whole. Leone's revisionist approach, which challenges the traditional conventions of the Western, was instrumental in revitalizing the genre at the time and inspiring future productions.By portraying a desolate and lawless West, filled with violence and morally ambiguous characters, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly resonated with audiences of the time and captured the melancholy of the turbulent 1960s. The film's visual style, influenced by Catholic iconography and surrealistic elements, adds layers of depth and meaning to the narrative.Sergio Leone managed to elevate the Western to an art form, surpassing the genre's expectations and creating a lasting cinematic experience. His innovative and daring approach set a new standard for Western films, and its impact can still be felt in the film industry today.In summary, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is an epic and unforgettable Western that has left an indelible mark on the genre. With its masterful cinematography, iconic soundtrack, engaging narrative, and brilliant performances, Sergio Leone's film remains an essential reference for cinema lovers and a timeless masterpiece that should be appreciated by future generations.","

"PCC0921","14 January 2021","Let's backtrack for a minute here. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (GBU), is the most famous of the Spaghetti Westerns, however, the Spaghetti Western was around a little bit before the release of GBU. The term basically describes Western films, based on American history, that were made in Europe, most notably Italy and Spain. Some also were made in Mexico and they all came out in the theaters in the 60s & 70s. It is actually a critical term that American critics coined in the 60s, making fun of these films, because America was so used to the TV westerns that filled the airwaves. But, as time moved forward, the term became acceptable, as well as, the movies themselves. It turned into a positive term, because these films were really good, but a little too different for some. These films now have achieved critical acclaim today, long after their release.GBU is the third film in a series known as ""The Man with No Name"" trilogy, directed by legendary, Italian film director, Sergio Leone. The musical score was done by master film composer, Ennio Morricone. He would later go on to do the score for Brian De Palma's Untouchables (1987), another great movie and favorite of mine.GBU is that classic story about three completely different guys, the good one (Clint), the bad one (Van Cleef) and the ugly one (Wallach). It has a wonderful collection of colorful, interesting supporting characters that help propel this film to its exciting end. Its so well, craftily done that you don't even notice the basic, simple plot of three outlaws, in the ultimate struggle to see, who can find the gold from a heist that was hidden away. This also helps to bring forward the time period that the film wants to establish, being as the gold was stolen from a Confederate stash during the Civil War. Eastwood and Wallach's characters get intertwined with each other, while Van Cleef's, Angel Eyes, always is looking for an opportunity to kill them both. It's a great story.Eli Wallach almost killed himself a couple times in this film. Issues with stunts and poor safety measures almost did some of the work for Angel Eyes. Eli Wallach is brilliant and funny in this film too. This is Clint Eastwood at his best. Clint's character also influenced Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), in Back to the Future III (1990). Having mixed language-speaking actors also complicated matters. Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach all spoke English, but most of the rest of the cast was Italian or Spanish, hence the need for dubbing. Sergio Leone spoke hardly any English, so he and Wallach communicated by speaking French to each other and the others had interpreters.Charles Bronson was originally chosen to be in Lee Van Cleef's ""Bad"" roll, but declined to be in the film. There is no dialogue in the first eleven minutes of the film, but who cares. GBU's strongest link is its dreamy-like imagery mixed in with amazing, mesmerizing music. This is what film is all about and this is the definitive Western.9.4 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.","

"SmileysWorld","5 November 2007","Greed.If you let it,it can overcome you.It has the power to turn your friends into enemies,and your enemies into friends.There's gold buried in a graveyard.There are three men.Two of them know what graveyard.The third knows what grave.These three men are not friends.Each one has nothing but contempt for the other two.That is,normally that would the case,but when there are riches untold involved,they are best friends willing to do anything to keep each other alive,even going so far as to declare war.....on a war.The Good,the Bad,and the Ugly is a well told story of greed and what it does to us if we let it.It is also great movie making from a time when the world wasn't in such a big hurry.It was OK to go ten minutes in a film without a single solitary word being spoken and to go from an extreme wide shot one minute to an extreme close up the next.It was non conventional for it's time,and that's what was,and still is,great about it.","

"mentalcritic","14 January 2001","The above quote is from Bill Hunt, one of America's best-known proponents of 16x9 Enhancement. Having seen this film very briefly on an old VHS tape, and then experiencing it on 16x9 Enhanced DVD, there is just no comparison. It's like looking at the interior of a mansion through a keyhole, then looking through the wide-open door. The scene in which Tuco discovers the graveyard where the pot of gold is buried is a classic example of a scene that loses all of its drama when chopped down just to fit some tiny little narrow screen.Of course, it's not just the cinematography that earns this film a place in the top 250 of all time. Clint Eastwood's non-existent acting style actually benefits the film, as the less his character says to anyone, the more enigmatic he becomes. Eli Wallach is annoying, but that was the whole idea all along as far as I can tell, and he does this job well. Lee Van Cleef is suitably devilish as ""Angel Eyes"" Setenza, the ultimate expression of the mercenary sensibility concept. They're the only three actors whose roles have any semblance of development, but the style they bring to each role is more than enough to carry the film by itself.It's also no accident that the main theme of this film, as well as ""The Ecstasy Of Gold"", the theme we hear during Tuco's hunt for Arch Stanton's grave, are among the most frequently replayed or outright ripped off pieces of film scoring in the history of cinema. The latter is especially powerful, as it takes what would otherwise be a meaningless sequence of a man dashing through a makeshift cemetary into one of the most powerful moments of the film. There's only one other composer I've heard who has performed an equally amazing feat through the use of music - John Williams.Of course, the best element of this film is that it shows the American Civil War the way it really happened. Slavery was just one element of the war, and a relatively minor one at that. Other elements such as British Loyalism, economic problems, taxation without representation, and general discrimination were the causes of the war. To the everyday man, represented in three different ways by the film's principal characters, the causes of the war were secondary to the opportunities for exploiting either side in order to make a fortune. It has been that way well before the Civil War, and it will always be that way long after the Civil War is long-forgotten. In that sense, this film is less a Western than it is a drama about three greedy men after a pot of gold.And if you want to see the reason why television screens are *finally* being made wider, get the 16x9 Enhanced DVD version of this film that is available in America (NTSC) or Europe/Australia (PAL). Cinematography just doesn't get any finer than this, and neither do dramas with Western motifs.","

"joshi_3592","24 October 2009","I'm glad I finally got down to seeing this film, I think everyone have heard about it, and everyone have definitely heard it's iconic theme music. The movie is three hour long (each move seem to increase with one hour) but that just makes it a movie with three hours of pure genius Western entertainment. Clint Eastwood as Blondie or ""the man with no name"" is as brilliant and bad-ass as ever, and even earn the title as ""the good"". lee Van Cleef returns with a new role (not the same role as in ""for a few dollars more"" as the well named ""the bad"" or ""angel eyes"". And Eli Wallach as Tuco ""the ugly"" a more humorous addition to the series, but also earn the title as he is neither good, nor bad. Greedy and a coward is a better description.Once again it's all about money, this time 200 000 dollars, a lot of money back then. I won't spoil much, the money is buried in a grave, and only Tuco knows which cemetery, and only Blondie knows which grave. And ""Angel eyes"" are never far behind them.This movie is a masterpiece of it's time, the acting is great, Sergio Leone deserves a lot of credit for this film, and the theme music is unforgettable. Plus they finally improved the dubbing which was a little unsynced in the two previous films. Also it portrayed a very realistic image of the American Civil War without taking any particular side in the conflict. then again the main character doesn't exactly care much for the war, they're just after the gold. Then still it's nice to see Blondie show his sympathy for those who fought and died in the war.I really can't recommend this film enough, if you haven't seen any of the films in this trilogy, buy them immediately and watch all of them. If you have the films and have only seen the two first, well what are you waiting for! Don't do anything other than buy this film, it's a must see and must have film. I give this film (obviously) a 10/10.","

"joberthefboom","1 June 2020","I've been watching a lot of classics lately and Sergio Leone's masterpiece couldn't be left out. I was a bit hesitant at first to watch it because I generally don't care much for Westerns. But it sure was well worth the time.The story starts rather slow and throughout the movie there isn't al that much dialogue. The dialogue that is being said though, is absolute gold and the entire movie is filled with memorable quotes that will stick with you for a long time.
The cinematography draws you in and combined with the slow pace makes for a unique experience. You get completely lost in the beautiful landscape and it puts you in a place you don't want to get out of. The movie can be considered long, with a runtime of nearly three hours, but you find yourself wishing for more when it is over.I also wonder if there were ever three more compelling characters put together than 'The Good' (Clint Eastwood), 'The Bad' (Lee Van Cleef) and 'The Ugly' (Eli Wallach). Three completely different characters that work so well together on screen and bring with them a continuous tension that puts you at the edge of your seat. Eastwood's 'Blondie' is the most fascinating character of the three. A man of few words but everything he says and does is coolness personified. He brings with him the illusion of being the good guy and of having a moral center while killing his way to $200,000 in stolen gold.Van Cleef's 'Angel Eyes' is evil personified in the story. With those menacing eyes you sense right away that he is ruthless in everything he does. But still you're never quite sure what he is up to and he keeps you guessing as to what his next move will be. Wallach's 'Tuco' is a very complex character on his own. Having no problem in lying and deceiving to get what he wants. Yet you can't help to have a little bit of sympathy for him and he is responsible for some of the funniest lines in the movie. ""I get dressed, I kill him, be right back.""The legendary score put together by Ennio Morricone is absolute perfection and brings a perfect sound to the amazing images. Tuco running through the cemetery whilst you hear ""The ecstacy of gold"" is one of the most memorable scenes i've ever seen in cinema. It is hard to find a more perfect half hour on film than the last thirty minutes of this Western epic.
How Sergio Leone manages to turn a stare down between three people in to one of the best and most exciting sequences put together is sheer excellence.Go watch this movie if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did.","

"Hayden-86055","31 December 2020","Sergio Leone proves yet again that he's the master of cinematography and the western genre. The film is so brilliant in setting up the tone and themes, slipping seamlessly from comedy to tragedy to violent passion and back to comedy again. Every character is designed to perfection, even the little characters who have but minutes of screen time are all interesting and very unique.Cinematography is spot on, with vast panning shots of the western land and also encompasses frequent but well placed close ups of character's faces so as to better read their emotions (or presumed lack of) and dominate the screen. Furthermore, in some shots what the camera cannot see the characters cannot see, and that gives Leone the freedom to surprise us with character entrances (Tuco surprised Blondie for example) that cannot be explained by the normal geography of shots.The music by Ennio Morricone is absolutely superb and can be both subtle and obvious to drive a scene and enhance the action. The sharp jab of music when the evil Angel Eyes first rides into frame leads to a certain level of unease that cannot be explained any other way apart from the music. Music that has long become legendary and iconic, rightfully so.The acting is breath-taking, Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, Lee Van Cleef and every single supporting actor (reluctant to use supporting considering how great the roles are) are perfect.10/10: You cannot dislike this film, and if you do you're just plain wrong in my eyes","

"hackraytex","4 August 2020","I read the first review here and it pretty much summed it all up. I saw the fully restored version a few years ago and have the DVD. The additional 14 minutes ties everything together and put the entire story in context.The restored version show something entirely missing in the earlier version.As noted, Blondie remarks that he had never seen so many men wasted for so little.The deleted scene where Angel Eyes comes to the Confederate infirmary, there is a brief spark of compassion in his face and eyes for all of the men lying there wounded and suffering.When Tuco is told by Father Ramirez that their father had just died and the father had asked for Tuco but Father Ramirez showed no compassion for Tuco for his absence. Tuco hits his brother and walks away feeling that Father Ramirez had not judged him fairly.The deleted scenes give a very accurate portrayal of the totally brutality of the Civil War. One of my ancestors was drafted into the war and was wounded and captured. He was released in an exchange and fought at Gettysburg at Little Round Top. He got sick and was left behind and captured again. He signed the pledge to go home and stay home which he did.The bitterness and desire for revenge went on for a hundred years since almost everyone had lost someone had lost someone or knew someone who had lost someone. A brutal experience that I hope is never repeated.","

"col547","26 June 2012","The third and final chapter in the Clint Eastwood/Sergio Leone/Ennio Morricone ""Dollars"" trilogy is regarded by many as the crowning achievement of the trio,s collaboration.It boasts towering star performances by (as usual)Clint and his old co - star Lee Van Cleef and his new co - star Eli Wallach,a memorable score,an unforgettable showdown in a graveyard and is possibly the most visually stunning western ever made.However,it is also overlong,slow and episodic.The main problem with the film is Leone was trying to do too many things at once.He was trying to be a more epic director,thus making scenes at an almost excessive length and simultaneously he was trying to make anti -war statements,which the film is littered with and sometimes brings the film to a standstill.Also,after the casting of Wallach as Tuco,he was finally directing someone who,s work he,d always admired,resulting in him shifting the focus of attention towards Tuco at the expense of The Man with No Name,which is a big problem I have with the film.I thought Wallach was fantastic as the greedy bandit,but a bit less of him and a bit more of Clint and Van Cleef would have gone a long way.The title is The Good,The Bad and The Ugly,not The Ugly Tuco show.The other problem I have with the film is the plot.Although good,it is very awkward and illogical.In the beginning of the film,Eastwood and Wallach are in the same town as Van Cleef pulling off a bounty hunting scam.Then sometime later after Wallach and Clint fall out,Wallach spends a lot of time tracking Clint down and they make a long trek across the desert.And just as Wallach is about to kill Clint,low and behold,a carriage of horses gallop along just in time to save Clint,s life (having already been saved earlier in the film by an exploding cannon).Then it turns out,inside the carriage is the very man that Van Cleef has been trying to track down.Then after Eastwood and Wallach are captured by the Union army,they end up unbelievably in the very same camp where Van Cleef is.And the contrivances go on and on.The Dollars films always had black humour,but this played like an unintentional spoof.In For a Few Dollars More,Leone was stylish,but never lost track of the plot.And he shifted the focus towards Col.Mortimer,but The Man with No Name was still part of the story.But sadly in this,Clint is too much in the background and at times it comes across as if he,s too aloof from the main action.I don,t really like to slam the film because it does contain some great moments,and I,ll always watch Clint as The Man with No Name,but his shrunken part in the story,some slow pacing and some laughable plotting are three reasons why it will never match the criminally underrated For a Few Dollars More.","

"highkite","12 July 2006","Civil War, gold is up for grabs, and three dirty cowboys all want it. Seems like a regular Western. It's a good thing film-directing God Sergio Leone and cowboy-extraordinaire Clint Eastwood paired up, because in that genre, there isn't a better match. To this day, there hasn't been a movie that comes close to the depth and craft that his movie produces.It's a beautifully woven-together piece of cinema that Sergio knows what to do with. He creates a feeling of both intensity and humor by portraying the three key characters with one trait only; The Good (Clint Eastwood), The Bad (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly (Eli Wallach). These characters follow their own instincts, whether it be good or bad, and let nothing stand in their way of recovering the gold. The only problem is, they have to work together to get it. One knows the place of the gold (a graveyard), and one knows which grave it's buried under. Just how long does it take until the cowboys let their pride and betrayal ruin their treasure hunt? Though the beautiful directing is immensely distinct and original, the movie is very plot-driven. The characters don't matter to us. We could have The Good play The Ugly and it would still be the same outcome. But from Sergio's vision, comes a truly magnificent submission into the psychology of the Civil War civilians and determined, gun-shooting varmints.At first, we meet the characters by obviously seeing them do what they're intended to do. The Ugly robs a store, The Bad kills a few people, and The Good saves someone's life. After that, we see that The Ugly and The Good are actually working together to do what dirty cowboys do best; collect their money. Upon finding out about the treasure, all three characters become The Determined, and both work together and hang each other by the necks (literally) to find the gold.From beginning to end, ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" is utterly entertaining and unique. It can be called both a Western and a War movie. As the plot develops and thickens, we see more of the setting than in all other Westerns combined. Everything is twice as big, and everything is twice as dirty. A definite classic, that defined cinema in more than one way, with its memorable score, to the never before seen directing, the movie stands as one of (if not the) best movies of all time.","

"andrewmerritt-31652","8 January 2020","The Good the Bad, and the Ugly is a spaghetti western film starring Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef. The film is directed by Sergio Leone and is the conclusion to the Dollars Trilogy, which also starred Clint Eastwood. The film centers on three outlaws who are on the hunt to find a fortune in gold buried in a cemetery. To kick-start this review off I will mention that this is the final chapter in the Dollars Trilogy. The Dollars Trilogy are three spaghetti films starring Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name. And these three movies are major influences that have inspired countless western films to come. But unlike the first two films, I think I speak for everyone in saying that this is the film that brings a breath of fresh air to the western genre. Even though the movie is called The Good the Bad, and the Ugly, the movie does display its good, bad, and ugly side to things. I don't know if it was Sergio Leone's intention to go all out in the final chapter and have this be his magnum opus, but he needs to work on the run time. This movie is three hours and in those three hours the movie felt like it was all over the place as we focus on these three outlaws hunting for buried treasure, but then it jumps to the American Civil War. There just needed to be some common ground on whoever wrote the script, but I didn't feel any connection. And when this movie was released, people didn't like it and received criticism as well. And in a way I feel like I fit that category because I didn't like it after it was finished, but it grew on me after. But ignoring its three-hour run time, the movie does make up for its brilliant dialogue, acting, and the music department. The music does a great job building that suspense feeling and I as I was watching this zoning in and out, as soon as that theme song kicked in, I knew I was in for a ride. And that last scene alone is enough for me to say that you should definitely watch this if you're not a fan of the western genre. I'm not the biggest fan of western genres, but Clint Eastwood makes any western movie enjoyable to watch that no other western character can top Clint Eastwood's charm and charisma. So in the end, even though this movie is three hours long to the point where it bore me to tears, the movie grew on me to the point that I realize while it may not be the best movie of the western genre, its still the one western movie I would recommend watching regardless if you hate western movies.","

Altogether I must have watched it at least 15 to 20 times, until I got tired nowadays I can't anymore, I saturate it, even because it's a very old movie, it got dated, even with all its mastery.For those who have never seen it, it is highly recommended, even though it is dated. Try to watch the movie knowing it was made 55 years ago, overlook the perfect shots and some funny expressions of the characters, the story is very good, it takes place during the American Civil War, a dying soldier buries 200 thousand dollars in gold and three men will go after this treasure, with the whole war scene in the background.The soundtrack of this movie can be considered without a doubt one of the best three in the entire history of cinema, and it alone is worth the movie. Who has never seen a Metallica concert opening with ""Ecstasy of Gold"". So it is...
In addition, great performances by a young Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef, added to a majestic direction by Sergio Leone.Without a doubt, a 10/10 movie, one of the best of my entire life, even though I was already saturated.","

"ccthemovieman-1","17 February 2008","Usually, the more I see a film the more I learn to appreciate it. Here's the opposite: I really enjoyed this when it came it at the theater. It made such an impression that I remember where exactly I saw this film, and I enjoyed it on TV a few other times afterward. Now, 40 years later my opinion of it is not the same. The only aspect that I still have a high regard for in here in the music, now considered probably one of the ""classic"" soundtracks.However, the three main characters - the men who dominate this film - played by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef - are really nothing but overly crude and excessively violent morons. The worst, of course, is Wallach's ""Taco."" He makes me want to take a shower after watching this film! He and Eastwood's ""Blondie"" just take turns brutalizing each other through much of the film. Van Cleef's role is considerably less, as ""Sentzenza"" or ""Angel Eyes.""Wallach's character is just plain insulting. He is a real lowlife and a horrible witness for anyone of the Catholic faith, which is why they probably emphasize the latter with him genuflecting throughout the film while acting like a complete degenerate. It's another slam on that denomination (of which I am not a member, by the way).I usually like Director Sergio Leone's long, dramatic, slow shots and good facial closeups Leone keeps his camera so long on one subject that it gets boring. So, there is a rarely a happy medium in this movie: it's either too violently stupid or too slow. What was once ""good"" has now turned ""bad"" and ""ugly.""","

It continues what the previous film was trying to do and improves on it ten fold. Clint Eastwood and Lee van Cleef were once again brilliant as was Ennio Morricone's soundtrack. The film in incredibly long but it doesnt feel it, every scene has meaning. Truly a must watch","

"khalidmoubile","30 June 2023","Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo.A bounty hunting scam joins two men in an uneasy alliance against a third in a race to find a fortune in gold buried in a remote cemetery.The good, the bad and the ugly is a classic western movie that I've heard a lot about, it's very simple than I thought it would be and it is enjoyable for someone that doesn't watch movies of this genre, very enjoyable for a film from the 60's.The plot was simply interesting to watch, so many legendary things that make this film a legendary one, the classic sounds effects, the classic story build up ,the classic soundtracks and more.I really loved the characters especially Blondie and his unstable relationship with Tuco, it was the highlight of this movie till the last second of it. Something creepy was about Angel eyes, his character was a pure frightening one in the screen, what a performance from each one of the epic trio .Directing was great considering the era, I want to see more of Sergio Leone's, especially if it's starring the goated Clint Eastwood .","

"EyeDunno","6 September 2012","Watch films and TV shows to this day and you'll see how deeply influential that ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" has been. Sergio Leone's masterpiece, to be sure. Just as influential, is the musical score by Ennio Morricone. Yet it's so interesting to note how Leone's style was greatly influenced by the work of John Ford. GBU is an essential film, and anyone reading this understands it. How many people, who don't like westerns, recognize that high-pitched wail that plays at the beginning and very end of the film? It's amazing that the film is 161 minutes long in its original theatrical release, but so many people are so satisfied with it from beginning to end. Most people generally root for that scoundrel, Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez - known as the rat! What I enjoyed was that Blondie was never *too* Good, while Angel Eyes was so good at being oh, so bad. Tuco, being the Ugly? You understand why he resorted to his ways as his character developed, and you tend to actually root for him. But you still never want to turn your back on him. One of my favorite intimate scenes was Blondie, taking a pause from a pursuit, crossing paths with the soldier. Not one word is said, but the moment between them is truly touching. The only person we truly don't get too close to, is Angel Eyes, but you simply don't feel cheated by that. The cinematography is exquisite. Whether it was the DP, Tonino Delli Colli, or the vision of Sergio's direction, you find a depth to the film like never seen before. The deep focus, using wide angle lenses to maintain focus from, say, a shoe in the foreground to people yards away, to the truly extreme closeups of only shifting eyes, is cinematic genius. There is not one actor that's off in this film. And the writing - three men pursuing a hidden treasure, through the back yard of the Civil War - is outstanding work, with just enough comic relief to give you a chance to relax from the countless number of climaxes throughout.""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,"" is the benchmark of not only westerns, but of filmmaking in general. This film, released in 1966, stands at #5 of the top 250 films, which says volumes, especially with over a quarter million votes. And GBU only won one award?","

"Gunmaster45","8 September 2007","I spent all day watching all three movies and this one beats the other two and near every other western out there. (with a few exceptions...) Usually, Spaghetti westerns annoy me do to the cheesy noises, unrealistic shooting, and lots of bore. But this movie was different. Unlike the other two, this movie had lots of simple comedy. (Most from Eli Wallach's silliness and stupidity as Tuco adds a perfect sense of comic relief and Clint Eastwood's slickness and intelligence as Blondie makes him so.... cool. Lee Van Cleef does a perfect job as the villain giving a sinister performance. Instead of the fact that the slow parts in the first two movies were boring, this movie took advantage of long shots for suspense and to get a sense of things which is a great directing tool. (Kudos to Sergio Leone) I can surely see why this is #4 on the IMDb top 250. It feels more realistic than the other two movies. No whistling noises when things fall, suspenseful music(and very famous), stellar acting, and nice shoot outs. One of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies and one of my favorite westerns ever! A+. 10/10 Watch this one right away. (I recommend watching the new edition DVDs, the white cases, because the quality is better, the sound is great, and newer, and the dubbing is near impossible to spot.) Don't miss this or you will miss one of the greatest, classic movies ever made.","

"evanston_dad","8 May 2014","It took me a long time to come around to the idea of watching ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" I'm not generally a fan of Westerns, and I always dismissed this film as the kind of movie fan boys would like.Well I've been watching movies for a long time, and I've seen most of the ""best of all time"" movies, so it's pretty rare anymore for a movie to join the ""one of the best films I've ever seen"" ranks. But Sergio Leone's simply magnificent film did just that. The first thing I asked myself when it was over was, ""Why did I wait so long to see it?"" For a cinephile, it's just utter joy to watch this movie. It's beautiful -- beautifully composed, beautifully scored. Every shot is a work of art by itself. But what surprised me the most was how funny and playful the movie is. It's like reading a Charles Dickens novel, waiting to see how the various plot threads are going to come together and what crazy twist the storyteller is going to throw your way next.Watching Sergio Leone's movie made me instantly appreciate Quentin Tarantino less. He obviously adores Leone and borrows (steals) from him outright, but what seems daring and original in Tarantino's work feels instantly derivative when you see the real deal and realize it was made over forty years ago yet feels more alive than almost anything filmmakers are putting out there today.Grade: A+","

"Rifat_Rock_Don","25 April 2020","One of the best depictions of war, and one of the best anti-war films. The best gunfight ever filmed. Consistently witty, often moving, brutally realistically ugly, and one of the most beautiful films ever shot, set to one of the most beautiful scores. The 's paghetti' label on the can means that these westerns will never get the consideration and respect they deserve. If you fancy thinking a little differently about 'T he Good, The Bad and The Ugly', try the following. Look past Clint Eastwood's legend-founding performance and suppose that the central character is actually Eli Wallach's Tuco, the Ugly. A gross rogue, guilty of every possible vice, Tuco is after all the character we see and hear the most, about who m we learn the most, and through whom we experience much of the action. Eli Wallach makes him comic, poignant, and plausible - certainly compared to the unrestrained darkness of Lee Van Cleef and the impossible cool of Eastwood. The film is largely Tuco's struggle to survive, and to earn a little on the side, constantly battered between Eastwood's ""blo nd Angel"" and Van Cleef's angel of death. Angels? Indeed: Tuco is ultimately human, and Tuco is all of us - grubby, corrupt, uncomfortable and slightly desperate humans, veering between the good and the bad, subject to a perplexing God and an unrelenting Devil, and just trying to muddle along.","

"mm-39","5 May 2001","This is a long movie, and it seems short; that makes it a good film. Funny and at times unbelievable, the movies strong point is its satire of the west.  It is a good story, and well acted.  The film is more of a art forum than your traditional western.  One point the director portrays in this film, is how gritty the west was, and how cruel the world is when the wicked play on their terms.  Worth seeing.","

"pinkliz41","22 April 2007","This is the closest thing to perfection, with pure great action, pure story telling and pure acting from visionary director Sergio Leone who has directed the two prequels to The Good The Bad and The Ugly, they are a fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. With Clint EastWood once again at the helm of the leading role delivers massive knockout performances as '' Blondie'' others in the supporting acting roles are Eli Wallach in the role of Tuco and the late Lee Van Cleef acting Angel Eyes. All of this though wouldn't have been possible without Sergio Leone, the man who set alight the Western frontier of films. Clint EastWood who has also been seen as one of the greatest Western actors of all time.Nothing could be greater and more pure than to have a top of the world actor and a great visionary director. I just cant get over the acting from Clint and the breath taking action set pieces. In one sentence: Truly worth watching!!!","

"zardoz-13","24 August 2010","Italian-born film director Sergio Leone completed his western trilogy with Clint Eastwood in what constituted a prequel to the ""Dollars"" movies. ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" qualifies as a sprawling tale of greed about three men and their tenacious search for a Confederate strong box containing $200-thousand dollars in gold coins. This memorable United Artists continued a trend in Leone's filmmaking. He kept making films that were bigger and bigger. Eventually, he would make an even bigger western than ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" entitled ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" Previously, Leone's first oater ""Fistful of Dollars"" had been produced on a shoestring budget and shared sets with another Continental western lensed in Spain. When Leone produced ""For Few Dollars More,"" he imported a second American actor, veteran heavy Lee Van Cleef, and commissioned art director Carlo Simi to construct an entire western town in Almeria, Spain. Reportedly, the El Paso town set cost more than the budget for ""Fistful of Dollars."" Meanwhile, Van Cleef reunited with Leone and Eastwood for ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" and Leone imported yet another American actor. Eli Wallach, who had played the bandit chieftain in John Sturges' classic ""The Magnificent Seven,"" signed on as the third American actor. Essentially, Leone cast Eastwood again as a bounty hunter designated as ""The Good"" and called him 'Blondie,"" while Van Cleef played ""the Bad,"" and Wallach appeared as ""the Ugly."" ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" became Leone's most expensive western to date and he set the action against the American Civil War. Naturally, all three eponymous characters are a little larger than life themselves. The relationship between the Eastwood as well as the Van Cleef character changed drastically because Van Cleef was not playing Colonel Douglas Mortimer. Ironically, Van Cleef's character was named 'Angel Eyes,' and he made his living as a man who hunts down other men and kills them for a price. No, ""the Bad"" isn't a bounty hunter. Meantime, ""the Good"" brings in a slimy, profane Mexican bandit named Tuco. He collects the reward on Tuco's head, and later shoots the noose from around Tuco's neck, so the slippery Mexican can escape. Later, Blondie and Tuco split the money. This relationship comes to an end because Blondie doesn't think that Tuco will be worth more than $3-thousand. Clocking in at 180 minutes, ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" bristles with shoot-outs. Live is cheap in the world of the Italian western and the horses outnumber the corpses. Money means everything. The three protagonists refuse to let a national catastrophe like the Civil War interfere with their plans to find the cashbox. Eventually, they do and confront each other in a massive graveyard to shoot it out. Anybody who considers himself or herself a connoisseur of Spaghetti westerns must watch ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" This savage western made quite an impression on audiences when it was released and Grammy Award-winning composer Ennio Morricone's orchestral soundtrack emerged as a hit on American music charts.","

"lovemichaeljordan","16 March 2023","I generally don't like westerns and I was not a fan of the previous two installments in this ""trilogy"", but this film is undeniably a legendary masterpiece. This is the mother of westerns. Can't find many weak points and I have to admit it has to be one of the best movies ever.First of all, the music must be mentioned. Ennio Morricone's score is unbeatable. It is undoubtedly one of the best scores ever. The film would have been nothing without the music. Scenes, where Tuco runs around for several minutes, would have been boring without the music. Add the music and you have one of the most iconic scenes ever. You can not look at a western movie without hearing this music play. It's so iconic that even if you have not seen the movie, you will have heard the score.It's an old film with old camera technology. This is where the film may lose many viewers. The last thing a western film - which is mostly set in an ugly and bleak desert - needs is bad cinematography. The cinematography is good for its time, but of course, it is not as strong today almost 60 years later. The camera work is impressive, but the technology hinders it. Fortunately, the score saves the sometimes very blurry and low-resolution images.The composition is perfect. So many new movies are heavily inspired by the photography from this movie. Director Sergio Leone is a master of visual storytelling. Many scenes do not even contain dialogue, but it is still clear what is going on. Small grimaces from the actor or small movements from the camera tell us enough. It is perfect.An example of visual storytelling is the scene when Tuco tries to find Eastwood's character. He follows a trail where someone has set several campfires. At these campfires, he finds Eastwood's old cigars. We know he's very close when he lifts a cigar and it's still smoking. The end of the film is also an exemplary example of visual storytelling. It is a fantastic feeling when you understand what is happening in the scene without dialogue. It's brilliantly done.All actors are good. Both the ugly and the good are good, but the bad gets too little screen time. The bad / Angel Eyes is played very well by Lee Van Cleef. He's a bit creepy while also being very charismatic. Nobody delivers a performance worthy of an Oscar, but it's solid acting from everyone involved.In conclusion, a legendary film that everyone must see. It has inspired countless amazing works. It's hard not to be blown away by epicness when the music plays. The film is as close to perfect as you can get. I understand why this film is still analyzed today. The film is really clever.","

"patrick_dunne","17 February 2006","""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" is the final movie of ""The Dollars Trilogy,"" nd had ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""A Fistful of Dollars"" coming before it.This one starts off very good. After the stylish credits and the famous music, we are introduced to every one of the characters. ""The Ugly"" (Tuco) gets his introduction with no dialog, and just action.""The Bad"" (Angel Eyes) really shows how ""bad"" he is, with one of the most ""bad-ass"" lines in Westerns. ""When I'm paid, I always follow my job through."" When you hear that line, wait for a couple seconds, and then you will know why he is called ""The Bad."" ""The Good"" (Man with no Name)gets introduced when he triumphs over ""The Ugly."" Of course, he's not really ""good,"" but most Western heroes simply aren't. Take William Munny in ""Unforgiven"" or The Lady in ""The Quick and the Dead."" To quickly sum up the story, ""The Good"" finds out the location of a treasure from a man's dying breath. (No, his last words weren't ""Rosebud."") They meet up with ""The Bad"" who also wants to get his hands on the treasure.The ending takes a lot of twists, and the quick-draw scene was very good. But, the film seemed to slow at parts that could have been easily cut down. For example, in the graveyard scene, Tuco runs around for at least three minutes, which means three minutes of boredom instead of story, dialog or action. Another flaw was the English dubs. Well, I'm not sure if they're dubs or not, but the voices don't match the mouth at times. Oh well. The ending was really good. Well, to be more precise, the last couple of minutes. Note: For all you Tarintino fans, this is his favorite movie.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.","

"dmatt-4","18 February 2008","In the late sixties and early seventies, in the days before video and DVD, I used to regularly go out to watch the Dollar movies in the West End of London. What more can you say about this fabulous movie that hasn't already been said. Not much more. To me the music makes it. I really think this is the greatest sound track of all time. There was a cover version of the title theme by Hugo Montenegro that was No 1 in the UK hit parade for at least 6 weeks and I can remember Jimmy Saville in his Blondie outfit with cheroot introducing the record on Top of The Pops. So this movie, the music and the characters were constantly in the public consciousness and at the office we were constantly using the line ""There are two types of people in the world my friend...."" To all the people who haven't yet seen this movie - lucky you. Do yourself a favor and go and get it. You won't be disappointed.","

"Don_Falone1985","9 July 2020","This, along with The Godfather are my favourite movies of all time. Both very different movies, but complete classics in their own right. TGTBATU is not only the greatest western of all time, but one of the best movies of all time. The incredible direction by Sergio Leone will never be beaten in my eyes and it is pitch perfect casting. Wallach as Tuco ( The ugly ) is one of the greatest characters of all time. Van Cleef as Angel eyes is pure perfection as the villain ( The Bad) and the brilliant Eastwood was born to play the role of Blondie ( The Good ). It has one of the greatest movie scores in history by the fantastic Moraccone (RIP) and gives you goosebumps when watching certain scenes when the music hits. It fantastically paced, despite being an incredibly long 3 hour film, but you would never know because you are so engrossed into the brilliant story of a trio of men trying to find buried gold. That's all I will say about the story because if you haven't seen it, you are missing out one of cinemas greatest masterpieces. The filming locations are also wonderful, set in Spain Almeria with the wonderful scenery. It truly is a wonderful film, and one that I have seen over 10 times. 10/10","

"classicsoncall","20 September 2007","I guess I find myself somewhat in the middle on this film, I enjoyed it to a point, but I don't get the sense that this is one of the greatest Westerns ever, and the Western is my favorite movie genre. I much prefer a good psychological Western between complex antagonists, Eastwood's own ""Unforgiven"" would be an example. This was more a straightforward tale of three desperadoes consumed by greed who attempt to outwit each other on the trail to an unknown grave containing two hundred thousand dollars in gold coin. Each though, earns their respective title credit in the story, even if Eastwood's Blondie might be the 'good' simply based on his classically rugged features.More on the plus side, it was really cool to hear the title theme music expressed in a handful of different ways throughout the story. The picture also captured the gritty realism of what the 1860's wild west was probably a lot like. You know, the more films I see of cowboys out in the desert days at a time with no access to soap and water, I start to wonder if they'll ever produce a picture that captures the fresh aroma of that experience. It's one thing to hear Tuco accused of smelling like a pig, but to actually get the full flavor of that would really be something. Then again, theater goers would never make it to the end of the picture - oh well for that idea.As for the film's length, I too side with those that feel it took a long time to get from Point A to Point B. I'm really wondering if it was necessary to bring in the Civil War battle for that bridge, but it did give rise to perhaps the most meaningful scene in the picture for me. Watching Blondie try to ease the soldier's death with his coat and a smoke was a masterful touch.You know, I could probably go so far as to put this film in the top twenty Westerns of all time, but it's position at #4 in the IMDb top rankings of ALL pictures (as I write this) is just too much of a stretch. That's probably the reason I find myself going to that page less and less, and watching movies of all types more and more.","

Unique and memorable!I've seen it twice now and it has grown on me. The three main actors (Eastwood, Wallach and Cleef) are full of intensity, mystery, edginess. The plot twists and meanders and takes it's time, and I'm saying that's good! We go on this epic journey as the lives of our three stars criss and cross and we really experience the crazy fortunes (and misfortunes) life can throw at you.Although I have not watched enough westerns to be any kind of expert, I think you can just feel ""cinema masterpiece"" when you watch this film.

"baz_trinity","2 March 2007","People like to throw the term 'Masterpiece' around and rarely is it ever as apt and as TRUE when concerning Sergio Leone's The Good the Bad and The Ugly.I mean, where to start? How about the music for instance, Morricone writes truly inspirational and masterful work, sure, everyone knows the theme tune, but his music has influenced EVERY western reference since. He captures the mood, the emotion and makes this movie EPIC with his wonderfully orchestrated scores. The landscapes and scenery are visually stunning and it's perfectly filmed for true atmosphere, intertwining with the aforementioned music, well it's nothing short of magnificent. Every scene is influential and significant, and equally as intriguing. The acting by Clint Eastwood can take no other meaning but 'cool'. He is what every gun-slinging', cigarette chewing cowboy is based on post-this and no doubt has inspired TONS of action heroes (Or indeed Villains) throughout cinema.But the storyline isn't as basic as one would first imagine: three gunmen searching for a rather large sum of money, it seems that simple. However, all of the gunmen have complex personalities and none are flawless in moral judgment, to which it is hard to judge who is indeed 'Good', 'Bad' or 'Ugly'. The classic 'Good Versus Evil' situation that is such a frequent theme in film (And coincidentally, more often in westerns) is slightly blurred in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and I personally think there is no definite and it is left up to the viewer to decide.This movie is simply essential viewing, an all-time classic and much deeper than would first appear. Incredible.","

"tfrizzell","5 August 2003","Sergio Leone's completion of the ""Nameless Man"" trilogy is definitely the most popular of all his films. It is the Civil War-era West and the three titled characters (Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach) are all after a hidden fortune of buried gold in an old graveyard. The typical twists and turns come with chess matches aplenty among the three leads as alliances are made, broken and made again. Eastwood became an icon with this one and has not looked back since. Once again, this film has little to do with ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"" except for Eastwood's mysterious drifter. Van Cleef plays a different role from the latter film and Wallach makes his first appearance in a Spaghetti Western. Leone shows a real love for the David Lean-styled epic with ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", but sometimes the film admittedly drags and becomes a little too long. It also does not become quite as complicated as it would have liked to be. Personally, I thought ""For a Few Dollars More"" was a better production and a bit deeper. Overall though this is another winner from the new-age cinema that came about in the mid-1960s. 4 stars out of 5.","

"hitchcockthelegend","8 May 2016","It's debatable of course, since there are legions of fans of the first two films in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trology, but with each film there not only came a longer running time, but also a rise in quality - debatable of course!Here for the third and final part of the trilogy, Leone adds Eli Wallach to the established pairing of Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, and brings all his tools of the trade to the party. Plot is slight, the three principals are on a collision course to find some buried gold, with each man having varying degrees of scuzziness, so how will it pan out?Such is the genius of the narrative, it's a fascinating journey to undertake. The characterisations are ripe and considered, the various traits and peccadilloes beautifully enhanced, and with Leone being Leone, there's no shortage of cruelty and humour. He also brings his style, the close ups, long shots and some outstanding framing of characters in various situations.The story encompasses The Civil War, which pitches our leads into ""The Battle of Branston Bridge"", where here we get to see just how great Leone was at constructing full on battle sequences. It's exciting, thrilling and literally dynamite, whilst Aldo Giuffrè as Captain Clinton turns in some memorable support.The Euro locations pass muster as the Wild West, superbly photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, and then of course there is Ennio Morricone's musical compositions. It's a score that has become as iconic as Eastwood's Man With No Name, a part of pop culture for ever more. It mocks the characters at times, energises them at others, whilst always us the audience are aurally gripped.There's obviously some daft coincidences, this is after all pasta world, and the near three hour run time could be construed as indulgent. But here's the thing, those who love The Good, The Bad and the Ugly could quite easily stand for another hour of Leone's classic. I mean, more barbed dialogue, brutal violence and fun! Great, surely!From the sublime arcade game like opening credit sequences, to the legendary cemetery stand-off at the finale, this is a Western deserving of the high standing it is held. 9/10","

"hall895","28 May 2015","Clint Eastwood is good, Lee Van Cleef is bad and Eli Wallach is ugly. Sorry about that, Eli. Eastwood again plays the Man with No Name whom we have already seen in A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. Our hero, this time referred to as Blondie, may be ""good"" compared to the other two leading characters but having seen the first two films we know he is not the traditional all-American hero. He's not all good, he's more complex than that. There's not much complexity to Angel Eyes, the character played by Van Cleef. This guy is bad to the bone. Meanwhile Wallach threatens to steal the show. He plays Tuco and this is a guy who, in an otherwise very quiet movie, never shuts up. Good, bad and ugly are searching for $200,000 in Confederate gold known to be buried in a cemetery. It's a very simple plot for a very long movie but the time flies by. Director Sergio Leone ratchets up the tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat.The events of this film, unfolding during the Civil War, actually take place prior to the events of the first two films in the Dollars Trilogy. And the war certainly intrudes on the story, causing complications for our characters in their desperate search for that gold. A big war battle scene lends a bit of grandeur that the first two films didn't have. Leone is making a film of much larger scale this time around. But while the war looms over everything this is still a story about our hero and the two companions he would very much like to be rid of. There are great twists and turns as at different times in the movie different members of the trio have the upper hand. Sometimes you're at the top, sometimes you're at the bottom, sometimes you're forced into an unholy alliance with your great adversary. All along the way there is much drama. And along with the drama there is plenty of action too. This is a movie which grabs your attention right at the start and holds it throughout.Blondie is the nominal hero, making Eastwood the nominal star. And, as already established in the prior two films, Eastwood suits the role perfectly. He's the perfect embodiment of the quiet, cunning, not totally heroic hero. Van Cleef played a good guy, more or less, in For a Few Dollars More. This time around he gets to play a total baddie and he sinks his teeth into the role with great relish. Wallach is a little over-the-top but delightfully so. Tuco is a crazed, maniacal character and Wallach pours his heart into his performance. He brings so much energy to the film. Three great actors, three great characters. Leone could hardly go wrong. And the film has so much more to offer. With breathtaking visuals and a truly memorable score the film both looks and sounds spectacular. Story, actors, cinematography, music. This film is the total package. It is certainly the best of the Dollars Trilogy, this is the Man with No Name's greatest adventure. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is often found on short lists of the greatest films ever made. That kind of acclaim may be overselling things just a touch. But there is no doubt this is a very good film, a thrilling last chapter in the story of one of the most iconic characters to ever grace the screen.","

"LeonLouisRicci","9 July 2013","The Good......it is one of those ""New"", groundbreaking, and completely different Movies that was quite influential, broke Taboos, and in the midst of a Decade of change was an announcement from a Director that said...""take this, you Western Movies"", and the Western Movies did and never looked back......The Cinematography expanses and lingering affection for landscapes brought the John Ford aesthetic to a new Generation and to a new level of opulence. There are some other Camera Tricks here that are playfully fresh (for 1966) and it was without doubt, Psychedelia before it was fashionable......The Soundtrack that is now an indelible part of Pop Culture and reminds us Today of how different it really was.The Bad......Endless Closeups of squinting eyes. A tendency to elaborate on already elongated Scenes to add to the already established Suspense......The Character Tuco becomes relentlessly obnoxious, overbearing, irritating, and unlikeable immediately and this keeps up for almost 3 Hours. It is an overacted Performance that makes the Movie less engaging......The length seems padded and indulgent.The Ugly......All the Characters, their Personalities and the Makeup. This is truly a Panorama of Ugliness throughout and given its length, a bit too much to bare......There is for your viewing pleasure...flies, filthy Faces (almost always in close up) chewing little cigars and sporting blood, pus, scabs, and other assorted flavors like food being shoveled into salivating mouths with Technicolor glee......Ugly could be a word that would describe this Movie. Another would be overrated.In conclusion......The best Spaghetti Western is from the same Director...Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).","

"martinpersson97","7 January 2023","Leone revolutionzed the spaghetti western genre in several installments, popularizing it for a wider audience and in this titular Dollar trilogy, establishing Clint Eastwood as a star.The idea of 'trilogy' is rather loose here, all of the three films being conceived as separate installments sharing some of the same actors - but it works very well in naming Eastwood's character ""The Man with No Name"".This third (and chronlogically first) installment focuses on three different titular characters, though, and they all shine masterfully. All of the three actors give it their all in portraying these iconic and very different characters, all culminating in an epic climax.The cinematography and cutting is amazing and some of the best of all time, so much that pretty much every western since has tried to mimick it.It's simply put one of the best and most important pieces of film history!","

"bryan_nixon79","5 July 2005","I was never really a fan of westerns until I saw The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. This is one of the greatest movies ever. Sergio Leone is a master director, who has also made Once Upon a Time in America, and Once Upon a Time in the West. He is probably the best visual director of all time. He films the cowboys like they are a part of the vast western landscape themselves. His pacing is patient, which works very well in his films. Some criticize his movies for moving too slow, but that allows for much build-up and some scenes and sequences that you will never forget. Clint Eastwood is the ultimate western gangster in this movie. This is where he first truly showcased his brilliance as an actor. If you have not seen this film for some strange reason, get up and watch this masterpiece before you die. Did I mention the score? It is in the same league as the score for Jaws. Intense. Powerful. Mesmerizing. Beautiful.","

"funkyfry","11 October 2002","Leone hits his stride -- it's beautiful, exciting, and very funny.  The music is Morriconne's most famous and was worked out before the film was shot so effects could be coordinated with sound.  The results are excellent. Eastwood is good, Van Cleef is as always campy fun, and Wallach is captivating as the best in the series of bandito/heroes in Leone's films. Good story introduces epic scope for the first time in a Leone film, marking a departure from the Boetticher/""psychological western"" style of his first 2 westerns.","

It has a very continuous structure so it keeps the audience entertained the whole way through Its a story of greed, hypocrisy, betrayal and ironic friendship.Its about 3 very different people (good the bad and the ugly) all going for the same treasure buried in a grave. Its a tense and edge of seat classic The music is nothing short of perfect, this is by far Ennio Morricone's best work and the music creates the films now clichéd stereotype which was such (and still is) a success in the 60's when it came out.In Conclusion, Don't be scared off by this movie because of its genre, I've never liked westerns but this was thoroughly entertaining a must see 8.9/10","

"gavin6942","9 April 2010","I just want to make a quick few comments here. I know this film is highly rated and people love it. And yeah, I found it enjoyable. I like a good shooter film with Clint Eastwood. But it seemed flawed and people are quick to forgive here where they don't elsewhere.The historical accuracy of the film is the biggest problem, with guns that are incorrect for the period, and the really strange suggestion that the North fought the South in this region... which, really, just didn't happen. I liked the drunk military man, but it wasn't realistic.The dubbing was annoying. Clint Eastwood speaks English and he speaks to a variety of characters who are speaking Italian. Okay, one or the other. Hire actors who speak English or get Italians and subtitle the film. It's awkward to have Eastwood talking to people who, on the set, who probably didn't understand.Lastly, I need more Lee VanCleef. If he's ""the bad"", he should have a bigger role. Instead you have mostly Eastwood, who is ""the good"", being just as bad as the villain. I respect the idea that good and evil are not clear-cut, but why do I side with Eastwood if he's no more good than VanCleef? That being said, the film had a lot going for it. Very fun shooter, great bridge explosion scene (possibly better than ""River Kwai"") and the very memorable theme song. As far as Westerns go, I don't know that it was really much more advanced than ""Stagecoach"". Maybe more epic and longer, and Eastood can out-act John Wayne any day, but there wasn't much new here.I recommend this and feel I need to see it again, but perhaps see ""For a Few Dollars More"" first... that will give you some VanCleef action and Klaus Kinski.","

This is the ultimate western, not made by John Ford, or starring John Wayne, by a great film by Sergio Leone, and starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and the great Eli Wallach.You want shooting? There is so much you will get a headache from the sounds of guns and cannons.You want laughter? The competition between Wallach and Eastwood was a constant stitch in my side.Yes, it is probably the best western ever.","

"shhimundercoverdamnit","11 February 2008","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Hey, Blond! You know what you are? Just the greatest son-of-a-b-! Sergio Leone was a director of boundless vision and ambition, a man with no little ideas. Everything you see is big, and ambitious. In a film that runs about 180 minutes... One could argue that Leone tells the story more with pictures than in words.Thus is The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. A story of three men who are all after the same fortune of Civil War gold. In fact, the secret of its location is spread out among them (one knows the cemetery but not the grave, and the other knows the name but not the cemetery). The men involved are Clint Eastwood ( The Good), Lee Van Cleef ( the Bad) and Eli Wallach ( the Ugly). Each man knows that they will remain alive until the grave is found.....but just as it always is- it is more than likely that each of them will try to kill the others for the gold.They are also men who really never need to explain anything, their eyes and actions could simply be deemed more important than their words. ( The obsession in Van Cleef's eyes) Though, Eastwood's character. Blondie. ( The Man With No Name) says very little, Eli Wallach's: Tuco never stops.In fact, some of the best dialgue from the film is of Wallach's 'speeches' about the differences between people. 'You can be one thing or you can be another.' He compares himself to Blondie, and to his own brother, who became a priest. However...... Blondie has the last word! Though there is no shortage of ideas in the film, there is also a film within a film. Thus, a grand Civil War sequence. One of the best scenes from the film is a scene in which a Union Army Captain ( Aldo Giuffre) explains the war to the best of his ability. The commander who has the most booze to get his troops drunk before the battle is the one who wins. However, probably my favorite scene from the film was the haunting runaway wagon scene. That cemetery scene with Wallach stumbling around is also a highlight.","

"morrison-dylan-fan","12 March 2012","Going downstairs the day after my birthday to check if any post had arrived,I was thrilled to discover that a very kind friend had sent me the uncut version of Sergio Leone's highly praised Spaghetti Western The Good The Bad And The Ugly on DVD as a surprise present!Having found the last Leone film I had seen, (A Fistful of Dynamite)to be outstanding,I decided to get set right away and experience Leone's epic Spaghetti Western for the very first time
View on the film:Charging into the Wild West to Ennio Morricone's extraordinary score the screenplay by co-writer/(with Agenore Incrocci/Furio Scarpelli and Luciano Vincenzoni) directing auteur Sergio Leone tremendously makes each of the three main characters distinct individuals, whilst gradually threading the films plot round the trio,with the initially three separate plot lines all joining up to create one wonderful thrilling Spaghetti Western as Angel Eyes,Tuco and Blondie's addiction in getting their hands on the gold starts to seep through their veins.Bringing a tough earthiness to the outlaw, Clint Eastwood gives a mesmerizing turn, making ""the man with no name"" look less a mythical superhero cowboy,and more someone who whilst cunning,is also able to get caught by surprise and left to dry to death in the middle of nowhere.Despite being the one with the least amount of screen time out of the three main actors,Lee Van Cleef gives a menacing performance as Angel Eyes,who even when in the background of scenes gives the film a chilling atmosphere of darkness descending on any area that he is closing in on.On the opposite side of the wicked Van Cleef and the smart,cunning Eastwood is the stunning Eli Wallach as Tuco, as Wallach creates an unforgettable love/hate friendship with Blondie as Tuco shows Blondie that he is far more intelligent than he may appear,and also creates a character that really helps the audience to enter ""the world"" of the film,due to Tuco having the perfect mix of a good comedic side and also having a charismatic go-with-the-flow attitude.Joined by a classic score,cast and script,director Sergio Leone & cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli bring the films thrilling Wild West- Civil War setting to vivid life with his gripping stylisation.Leone holds the trio from getting pulled into the total bleakness of the Civil War that is taking place around them, by placing the main focus on the chase for the gold,as Leone keeps the movie moving at a lightning fast pace, from the almost three dimensional,fantastic endless sets to the nail-biting gun battles where Leone uses his elegant wide shots to show the distant between each character and his beautiful extreme close-ups to build up a huge amount of tension between the good the bad,and the ugly.","

"bob the moo","5 October 2003","Two men have a partnership  one (the good) pretends to capture the other (the ugly) claiming the reward before rescuing him from his sentence.  When the two have a falling out they spare each other simply because they both know part of the location of hidden confederate gold.  Meanwhile a corrupt soldier is also hunting for the location of the gold or anyone who may know where it is.Routinely heralded as one of the greatest westerns ever made, I must admit to always feeling a little disappointed by this film whenever I watch it. However I always then assume that it is a classic and come back to watch it again!  There is no denying that the film is very stylish and very memorable but it's main problem is in it's basic plot not being long enough to justify such a luxurious running time.  This results in the film really dragging at several points  this is not a major problem but I did wonder why it could not have been edited to suit it's spaghetti style.The music and action is much imitated and well known to even those who have not yet seen the film.  The closing stand-off is fantastic and the music throughout can only be described as iconic.  The film does manage to cover 180 minutes well but I just had an issue with it's very wandering nature and the fact that it does drag a bit.The cast is all good.  Some of the support is badly dubbed but I always found that to add to the character of the film rather than be an annoyance. Eastwood had a hard time on the set but still delivers a really good performance  the type which made his name in this type of film.  Wallach has the biggest role as Ugly and is very good in an unsympathetic role.  Van Cleef is a good Bad and is a cool foil for Eastwood.Overall I always enjoy this film but would draw the line at putting it as high up the top 50 list as it usually appears to be.  The film is iconic in so many ways but I just don't like the way that it seems to drag at several points  it could easily benefit from losing 20 minutes.","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","19 February 2018","'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly (1966)' has a different feel to the others in the trilogy, actually coming across as closer to 'Once Upon A Time In The West (1968)' than 'For A Few Dollars More (1965)', almost to the point where it feels as though it occupies a different sub-genre, one with a much stronger focus on the civil war and the spectacle such a state provides. It's an epic, the wide frame capturing both the sweeping vistas of war-torn America and the weary lines snaking across the faces of its seedy inhabitants, and it's masterfully helmed throughout. Another big draw of the long-winded narrative - which loses all but a modicum of its steam when the feature takes an extended detour into an admittedly visually stunning yet narratively unnecessary large-scale battle just before the final confrontation - is the amorality of the three equally charismatic leads, the titular labelling of whom is thankfully rather arbitrary (given that Eastwood's nameless protagonist is awarded the 'good' moniker 28-minutes in after he's just left a man for dead in the middle of the desert), and their constant double-crosses and back-stabs makes for an interestingly unpredictable ride. The feature keeps you on the edge of your seat until it's blistering finale that proves, once again, Leone is the master of guns and gazes. 8/10","

"lasttimeisaw","23 October 2012","Sergio Leone's third piece of the Dollars Trilogy, years ago I watched A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS (1964, 7/10), but FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE (1965) is still sitting laid-back in my waiting to see list. I wish my jumpy sequence might not hinder the logical understanding of the film, although it is never a major concern of Mr. Leone and his team.I cannot claim myself an ardent Western genre follower, also without any trickle of fetish towards neither guns or other weaponry, nor killing for fun, plus being an out-and-out urbanite, my natural response over the usual tonal settings of Western films is quite nonchalant (also the bleak milieu is not my preference to admire), what I need to fathom is whether it will evince any on-screen dynamite to maintain a buoyant vibe through its storytelling and action. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, without any doubt, has done a crack job here, the lengthy narrative never cease to fall into tepid, three leading characters are richly depicted with accumulated details and minor plots, Eli Wallach's the ugly, who receives the most amount of screen time and rendered as a complete hypocrisy and opportunist, is the arch-protagonist, Eastwood and Van Cleef's roles are less colorful but more pragmatic to be idolized in the hero and anti-hero cinema realm. One cannot evade Morricone's masterly work (not only in Leone's filmography), but here, his knack of enhancing the whole film's temperament has been comprehensively facilitated, the hyena-mimicking theme tune for me is something worth persisting for my entire life. The very much discussed and highly appreciated Mexican standoff could be regarded as the pinnacle of the wholesome western films, Leone's obsession with relentless close-ups is another trademark of its own kind. Leone's film career is an underachieved one, and most of his fame has been accruing after his untimely decease in 1989 at the age of 60, with only 7 feature films under his rein (another one I have watched is his swan song ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, 1984, 8/10), if only he could live a bit longer, his feat would easily stride outside his comfort zone and evolve himself and his work with the time, like what Martin Scorsese has attained. What should I whine about the film? I really cannot say it explicitly, the only thing impedes me from rating it higher is the innate trait of the grumpy and grubby world, which seems to me like a pit on earth.","

"SAMTHEBESTEST","24 April 2020","Finally The Good The Bad And The Ugly (1966)
Now that's what i call Real Men's Cinema. No love story, no melodrama, no emotions just the bullets and machoism till the last stage. A real man would love this film more than any other love triangle story with women and Romance involved in it or a happy go lucky film because this is stuff made only and only for Men. I doubt any such particular film was ever made for Women or will ever be made. We Men are lucky, aren't we? Possibly, it is the Spaghetti western which was better than many big budget films in the genre. I can sense so many nuances in the screenplay where the hero proves that this is how a real man should be. The other 2 guys doesn't care much about anything but money. Clint Eastwood as The Good proves what the real Good means even in bad encounter. Lee Van Cleef as the Bad brings the cruelty into the character whereas Eli Wallach as Tuco AKA the Ugly did exceptionally well. If i have to mention some iconic scenes then i would go with the introduction scene of all 3 guys in the film. One can do anything if he is paid, other one is lusty for money and the 3rd guy is one hell of a good fella, doesn't matter what the situation is. Other than that, there are multiple situations which i can say are influential and iconic and have inspired so many action films over the years. The Background score which is still giving me chills. The Good The Bad and The Ugly is well known as Sergio Leone most hard-hitting work and totally different vision to look at a western film. The distinctive use of violence, cold blooded encounters, stylistic bullets fires and machoism of the lead hero all these things surely makes The Good The Bad and The Ugly a Classic Western Action film. And like i said, if you're bored of typical romance, unnecessary melodrama and mainstream dramas then this film is the most different experience for you just like it was for entire generation of 60s Cinema Lovers.
Rating- 8/10*","

"dromasca","27 December 2010","Seeing again the last film in the 'spaghetti westerns' trilogy was a true revelation. It already happened to me to see classical movies, live again the feelings I had at the previews viewing and discover new perspectives brought up by the years. With 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' something different seems to have happened. It's my third viewing if I remember well. I scarcely remember the first one, I was a teenage and I must have seen the movie at the same time I was seeing other classic westerns like these starring John Wayne. Then I saw it again in the 90s and what struck me was the fabulous acting especially Eli Wallach's. This latest experience is different as I dare now discharge all the labels and enjoy what is best in this film - the camera art, the dynamic of the characters, the superb acting of the three lead actors, Ennio Morricone's music which entered the best soundtracks gallery, the color and diversity of the extras and the fresh perspective brought to a moment of history often present in the American film. By the mid 60s when Sergio Lepne had the chutzpah of undertaking the trilogy project western was a genre in stagnation. The period of the big films of John Ford was passed over, actors like John Wayne or Richard Widmark were beyond their pick, and westerns were not considered a source of blockbusters by the big studios.It was kind of natural to expect renewal to come from out of America, as in Europe the Far West space was keeping its fascination and the potential of staging eternally human dramas. After the success of the first two films in the trilogy Leone wanted the third one to be a quality upgrade, more ambitious and more stylish. Although he could not hire the actors he wished, he was lucky to receive as replacement Eli Wallach who gives here one of the best performances of his career, a combination wicked shrewdness and surviving skills, a dangerous creep with a sense of humor. The viewing is a fest from start to end. That was the period of Technicolor and big screens, and Leone masters the technology and the format, which fit the endless desert where most of the action happens. While filmed in Spain, one can say that never had Andalucia looked so Texan. The local extras faces carved by wind and sun fit perfectly the cinematographic landscape. Morricone's music fills in the vision in a synthesis that was played and quoted in endless movies that followed (to mention 'Kill Bill''s theme as the last I remember). Especially visible and special is the reconstruction of the Civil War background. From 'Gone with the Wind' to 'Cold Mountain' this is one of the most filmed episodes of American history, allowing for numerous mass and battle scenes. Amazingly the vision of the Italian Leone fits perfectly in the gallery. Moreover the juxtaposition of the situations of fortune seekers and of the soldiers caught in the absurd of the was allows for a comparison with anti-militaristic nuances. Soldiers and adventurers play death games with little chances of survival. And yet, for at least one moment the the game of the fortune seekers seems more rational and even more human than the organized game of destruction called war.The actor that dominates the film is without any doubt Clint Eastwood. Closing up the trilogy that launched his career, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' brings the last touches to the portrait of the Man with No Name from the previous movies, the soldier of fortune and killer who never draws first his gone and never kills without a reason. The script places him here in different situations than in the previous movies, but the scene of the duel in three close to the final brings him back the poncho as the sign that the cycle draws to its end. In the permanent game of trickery and death Blondie is the only of the three characters that allows to himself manifestations of humanity and acts of compassion that endanger him. Howevwe he knows and we know that he aims and shoots faster and better and he will eventually prevail. The final scene with Eastwood's character melting in the infinite desert landscape closes up in the best possible way Leone's trilogy.","

"ElMaruecan82","30 July 2011","INTRODUCTION :A nasty face full of scars and sunburns suddenly fills the screen, covering the extended vision of the Sierra landscape : a curious opening, creating two incongruous feelings of authentic yet comical ugliness. This sums up the very essence of the 'Western Spaghetti', a pivotal sub-genre that traced the singular evolution, hence the survival, of the Western genre in two polar opposite directions : the ""anticonformity"" and the ""overconformity"" or let's just simplify and say ""demystification"" and ""amplification"".DEMYSTIFACTION: Akira Kurosawa's innovative ""Yojinbo"" ended the classic 'good vs. bad' antagonism, which directly inspired Sergio Leone. Like ""A Fistful of Dollars"", the realism of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" lies within the lack of morality of the three main characters, each of them has malicious motives. Leone's intuition over using Kurosawa's characterizations proved to be useful for the Western genre that was begging for a metamorphosis. John Ford's era was over, and with all due respect to John Wayne, everyone knew how the West was Won, and were tired of the pompous idealism displayed, despite the breath-taking imagery of Monument Valley. Even the mythic Civil War, the powerful symbol of the fraternal fight that ultimately consolidated the American spirit, is treated like a vulgar subplot, which somewhat betrays the foreign aspect of the film, and in the same way, sweeps off all the dust of semi-propaganda stuff disguised in entertainment. The myth was agonizing, and the 'Western Spaghetti' genre proceeded to a sort of creative destruction.Take the three main characters, the irony in the title, is that all their 'nicknames' are interchangeable, there is something ugly in the bad, and vice versa, and the good isn't 'boy-scout' good. Listen to the opening credits, flute for Blondie, Clint Eastwood as the Good, ocarina for Sentenza, Lee Van Cleef as the Bad and human voices for Eli Wallach as Tuco, the Ugly. Different instruments were used for each but they all play the same iconic melody, inspired from the howling of a coyote. Symbolically, each character is different, but the deadly greed inhabiting their hearts is the same, it's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" rather than ""The Good vs. the Bad vs. the Ugly"". Their relationships are all tactical, cynical and hypocritical, with friendships based on a mutual need to reach a hidden gold. The Good and the Bad need each other, because they know half the secret about the gold's location, and Sentenza, need them alive to find it. They're all tied to each other until the strongest and cleverest wins; this was the humanistic reality during the dark ages of the last century.AMPLIFICATION: I guess the fact that I watched it for the first time when I was 10, built my personal affection to the film, because at that age, my expectations were not tarnished by the cynicism of the classic know-it-all film buff. For me, the three characters were not similar; the Good was the hero, the Bad, the villain, and the Ugly, the comic relief. They happen to be the only recognizable actors' faces in the film, but it hardly matters because we don't need them overshadowed by other supporting performances. Eli Wallach, in a career-defining role, is the fastest talking and provides the best moments of the film as the indisputable scene stealer. His humor also relies on the exciting duo he formed with Blondie whose cool sense of humor, and cynical detachment proved at many occasions to be the yin to Tuco's yang. And Lee Van Cleef is the senseless, cold-blooded killer who makes the Ugly look Good. He represents the dark side of the film, a man who always finishes his job, and from the first scene involving him, I took him as the bad guy of the story. The characterization is why I loved the film both as a kid and as a movie buff.The line between amplification and parody is very thin, but there's a difference. When parody takes all the conventions into derision, amplification insists on them, providing the typical Leonesque shots. Time is dilated, locations are magnified, like belonging to a unique dimension, and the whole film oscillates between extreme close-ups and extended shots from very far away. All the effects are amplified with cinematic hyperbolas exceeding the limit of believability. In his 'Great Movies' review, Ebert stated that Leone invented a rule which consisted on the characters' point of view limited by the screen. I never understood until I re-watched the film and got it, and I respect Leone even more for having pushed the limits of creativity to this point since most of the greatest effects from the film depend on that rule, and are transcended by the iconic score of the musical genius, Ennio Morricone. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" has all the tragic, comic, epic and musical elements that makes it a kind of operatic masterpiece.CONCLUSION :Film-making is far from being an exact science, and you can make a masterpiece out of the least complex plot elements, the lowest budget, and the cleverest directorial tricks. Not to diminish the quality of Leone's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" but the point is that the movie works as if it was self-aware of its own restrictions and transcended it with a magic that another director, wouldn't have judged necessary. Some apparent weaknesses are sometimes the necessary drivers to push the creation to the limit of genius while confidence can work as a tricky obstacle, maybe that explains why ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is the highest ranked Western on IMDb Top 250 and undoubtedly the most iconic.So, to conclude, I would simply say that there's two kinds of people in this world, those who love the film, and those who don't get it ...","

"Atreyu_II","26 July 2010","I won't say this is the most overrated movie ever made. There are many movies which are considered among the best ever by the majority of people that are as overrated as this one is. However, that this is one of the most overrated of all time, no one can deny that.I hate westerns. However, considering the fame of this one, the fact that it is in most lists of the all time's greatest movies, the fact of being a Spanish-Italian production and the value that most people give it (including this guy who is a friend of mine, who owns the movie and loaned it to me), I decided to give it a look, even though its long runtime could easily scare me off.I know that its Italian title is 'Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo', but I don't know if it was filmed in English language and later dubbed in Italian or the contrary, although I believe it was filmed in English.This spaghetti western was directed by Sergio Leone and stars Clint Eastwood as Blondie (""The Good""), Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes (""The Bad"") and Eli Wallach as Tuco (""The Ugly"").To be frank, the character Tuco annoyed me very much, not to mention that he was worst than snakes. Angel Eyes was nowhere near as annoying, being a more likable character in comparison. Blondie is a more complicated character. He's supposed to be the good guy yet he teams with Tuco during most of the movie and actually saves him twice from his execution rope (including in the end, when he was supposed to kill him). He kills Angel Eyes, yet he doesn't kill Tuco - and after everything that Tuco did to him. He is not that good after all...There's some good in this movie but I saw far more of bad and ugly in it. There is brutal violence in this. Plus, the movie is way too long. And it doesn't really offer much during its runtime of nearly 3 hours.Certain sequences were filmed in a way that strongly resembles me '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The first 9-10 minutes are a good example of this. The opening is long and has music, there is no dialog, the slow pace of the scenes gives us time to appreciate the scenario. Another good example of this is the Mexican standoff scene that lasts 5 minutes near the ending when the 3 main characters stare each other down in the graveyard's circular center, calculating alliances and dangers (and the amazing distance which the camera films it).The famous film score by Ennio Morricone (who is a genius, like John Williams) is phenomenal, especially the spectacular and unforgettable main theme. But the music that plays when Tuco is running in the Sad Hill cemetery is equally memorable.I didn't know that this movie was part of a trilogy, much less that it was the 3rd one. I also thought it was from the 50's, not the 60's. Anyway, none of that matters. This movie didn't do anything for me. Is this one of the all time's greatest movies? Absolutely not!","

"Carol_cc","19 June 2020","The three-hour plot is not procrastinating. All the characters are full-bodied and have distinct characters. Definitely the best work in Westerns. Incorporating the elements of the Civil War enhances the film's conception, increases the depth of thinking, and at the same time it is properly filled with a relaxed and humorous atmosphere.","

"Horst_In_Translation","2 August 2019","""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" or ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is an Italian co-production that is in the original also in the English language and was released back in 1966, so this one is over half a century old now already, which sadly means that almost all of the people working on it are (long) gone. But first things first. The director here is Sergio Leone and he is also one of many people working on the screenplay here. The movie runs for considerably over 2 hours and there are many versions out there, one of them even crossing the 3-hour mark. The cast includes many well-established actors and the big name by today's standards is of course Clint Eastwood who was in his mid-30s when this was made. Maybe Eli Wallach (who almost turned 100 before his death not too long ago) is also still known to many and maybe even Lee Van Cleef, who did not get as old as the other two. These three play the main characters in this movie we got here, the three mentioned in the title. And there is a nice introduction so we know who is who. And the ugly even gets another quick mention near the end, maybe because his one at the beginning was so short. Honestly we learn a lot more about the ugly in the introduction of the good than in his own introduction. Or maybe he gets the one at the end because in my opinion he was just the most memorable of the three and Eli Wallach also gave the best performance in the movie. Already how effortlessly he looked like a Hispanic was impressive because he really was a Jew. And he is also the one who kept this film from becoming too serious because his character always brought in some comedy value and even during these moments when Eastwood makes a short funny one-liner like along the lines of ""idiots they are talking to you"" Wallach is present and his body language adds a lot to the fun element. But people should not mistake Tuco for a fool. He may not be educated or a leader, but he makes up for it with grit determination and also ruthlessness. And there is also a soft side to him, he is not as cold-blooded as Sentenza, who would kill anybody if he had to. Tuco's soft side is especially brought out by his brother as we see during one scene and despite being a ruthless killer he believes in God and salvation it seems. He also mostly really only kills those who did something bad to him first, such as Eastwood's character, but also Sentenza's big henchman.Sentenza really has no mercy for anybody and he is also a schemer unlike Tuco. A really dangerous man, who still is a man of his word. When he makes a contract, he fulfills it. You could also call him talented when it comes to upping the ranks as you see when the two more central characters get caught in a funny sequence that involves a lot of dust. But like I said nobody here delivers the comedy as good as Tuco/Wallach. Even if he goes over the top, it is still hilarious to watch and never feels out of place. The best example is really the scene when he all of a sudden acts like a best friend to Blondie to find out the name of the grave where the treasure is hidden. By the way, I also liked at the very end that there was an actual treasure and not just some meaningful message à la ""the biggest treasure is friendship"" or so. There is none of that anyway. The three-men shootout shows it best. It is a matter of life and death. Honestly if the other two, especially Tuco, had been as smart as Blondie they could have guessed where the treasure really is. There must be a reason he knows the name and surely it is not that the name he mentions was a deceased friend or so. Also makes sense Blondie does not tell Tuco the real name, he is too smart for that, just like the empty name on the stone. Also pretty fitting that the treasure is in the grave of an unknown soldier in terms of the political message the movie sends. It takes place during the days of the Civil War and there is one lengthy sequence when Tuco and Blondie are led along by a captain and this is the one occasion during which the focus is not really on these two, but on the pointlesssness of war back then just like today. The bridge is the best example. They won't fight for it, but just go elsewhere and fight if it is gone. It's pretty deep and telling how the captain waits for the bridge to be destroyed and smiles before he passes. So yeah this was interesting because the sequence felt so different compared to the rest of the movie, but still it felt like an essential inclusion nonetheless.Basically I could really write a novel about every single scene here. Other people have said it correctly that each and every one of them adds a lot. Also the small characters are memorable like the fat henchman I already mentioned. Or the guy who lost a hand and wants his revenge on Tuco and probably half a dozen other characters who maybe would have deserved their own movie. But good that these three got it. Actually, in the German title there are only two characters mentioned and called something like crooks. I still prefer the three, even if Sentenza / Angel Eyes is not as much in the center as the other two. Now finally a few words on Blondie as a big Eastwood fan. He was coolness personified, but not an invincible superhero as you see from how he is tricked by Tuco during the spikes scene and even if he gets away there, Tuco gets him again, which shows you he knows how to get his revenge. During the lengthy desert scene he really suffers badly, but still most of the time he is nicely in control of it all. A really memorable character we got here, even if maybe how he is depicted with baby kittens was slightly too much. We get it he's the good guy, the only one really with morals and nonetheless as relentless and determined as the other two. That he cares at least a bit for other people is shown in the scene when he has too say goodbye to Shorty when he found another partner in crime for his bounty hunting scam. He was not as blond as I thought he was though that he deserved the nickname. I watched this movie as part of a retrospective on Ennio Morricone and it was a truly nice experience. It was not the first time I saw it and honestly it did not take away any of the quality, or almost none, that I basically knew the key plot points, even if it has been a long time since I saw it. So yeah I already mentioned Morricone, his soundtrack here is really as defining as it gets for the western genre which was also proved by the people dancing and moving in their seats in my showing every time the soundtrack was heard and so is the movie itself. No doubt most people consider this one of the five finest western movies ever made, if not the number one even. And I can see where they are coming from. Really almost everything works out about this one, also the sound side away from the music, be it the effects of running horses or gunfire you just really felt inside the movie. What did not work out was Wallach's and everybody else's glaring omission from awards bodies. Oh yeah also this is one of the westerns that has no female love interest for the protagonist(s). The woman you see in Bad's presentation for example is all you get. And that is perfectly fine and enough. I give it a big thumbs-up and it is a definite contender for best film of 1966. Highly recommended.","

"OllieZ","17 April 2007","Basically, if you have to see one western, watch this one. From the opening credits, you can tell its going to be a stylish, bloody ride.What I admire most about this film is the attention to detail. Leone doesn't rush scenes; sometimes we have shots up to five minutes without dialogue.Tension chews nearly every scene as we observe the eyes and hands of the characters. It's as much a film of greed and civil war, as it is about deception.The acting is perfect all round. Clint, Wallach and Cleef are all amazing in their roles. They manage to live up to their roles of good, bad and ugly well, but it's not as clear cut as that. The characters in this film are all morally ambiguous and so they should be. At a time like the civil war, even the ""good"" can be ""ugly"".Great direction, superb acting and amazing style. The film is very efficient at telling its story - and the ending is amazing.Definitely watch this.","

"Tweekums","25 November 2015","This classic spaghetti western follows three men as the search for a quarter of a million dollars during the American Civil War. The first 'Angel Eyes' is a gun for hire who learns the name of the man who stole the money from one of his victims. The other two are Tuco and 'Blondie' have been working a scam where Blondie turns in Tuco for the reward money then rescues him to do it again in another town till they have a falling out. Shortly afterwards they come across a Confederate coach that just happens to contain the man Angel Eyes was looking for; he tells Tuco about the gold and the name of the cemetery where it is buried then, while Tuco is getting him water he tells Blondie the name on the grave if either of them are to get their hands on the money they will have to work together. Things don't go according to plan and they have a run in with Angel Eyes; he gets the name of the cemetery from Tuco then offers Blondie the same 50/50 deal he had with Tuco. Ultimately the three of them will be reunited in the cemetery but which of them will get the gold.This is probably the best known of the spaghetti Westerns and deservedly so. It starts with a quiet menace as we are introduced to Angel Eyes (The Bad) then shows a touch of cynical humour as we are introduced to Tuco (The Ugly) and Blondie (The Good). The plot is fairly simple but the journey for our protagonists will be anything but as the travel through the war torn American South West towards a grave in a remote cemetery. Their journey will be full of betrayals as each tries to get the information that will cut the others out of the deal. People who are used to classic American made westerns may be a little surprised that there are no heroes here; all three protagonists are venal, cynical and would happily kill the others for the cash this of course is what makes the film so refreshing! It is also quite violent for a film of its time with numerous shootings and plenty of blood.Director Sergio Leone captures the action perfectly and the cast do a fine job. Clint Eastwood brings a dry humour to the role of Blondie, Lee van Cleef is delightfully unpleasant as Angel Eyes and Eli Wallach is great as Tuco. The story has plenty of action, some amusing moments and even a few touching scenes such as when Tuco meets his brother. The Spanish scenery looks spectacular and more like the 'Wild West' than many westerns churned out in California. It is impossible to comment on this film without mentioning Ennio Morricone's score; it is brilliant throughout but there are some scenes that will have the viewer reaching for the remote to crank up the volume; not only does it sound great it also fits with the action. Overall I heartily recommend this; it is deservedly considered a classic.","

"Jeremy_Urquhart","18 February 2022","Yes, it takes its time setting things up, and the main ""plot"" starts about 70 minutes in, but when it kicks off in the second half, it builds from one iconic scene to the next, each one better than the last, and becomes not only the best western of all time, but one of the best films of all time.And I still really like all the setup. Still plenty of iconic scenes there, and I think the last 20-30 minutes wouldn't be nearly as impactful if that first hour or so had been edited right down.Speaking of the final 20-30 minutes, everything that happens from the bridge scene onwards is just some of the best stuff I've ever seen in a movie. My heart was racing even though this was probably about the fourth time I've watched this movie. Everything in the cemetery is like 12/10 good; I can't even put it into words. The music is godlike, with Ecstasy of Gold and the track that plays during the three-way duel among Morricone's best (and let's not ignore the fact that the rest of the soundtrack is incredible).It's arguably Clint's best role, too, and even then, he's often foreshadowed by an even better Eli Wallach, who dominates the screen in creating one of the best characters of all time, Tuco. While Lee Van Cleef isn't given as much to do, he's also fantastic, especially in his first couple of scenes, which establish how cruel and calculating Angel Eyes is.The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is just about perfect. If you're not feeling so keen on the deliberately-paced first hour, stick with it, and your patience will definitely be rewarded. Sergio Leone was one of the best filmmakers of all time, and this film's one of his best.","

"Heimdal_88","26 March 2006","'Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il' was at its release in 1966 a very unconventional Western epic that follows the travails of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen Confederate gold.Also known as 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', it was Italian-born (Rome, 3 January 1929) Sergio Leone's third so-called spaghetti Western after 'Per un pugno di dollari', aka 'For a Fistful of Dollars' (1964) and 'Per qualche dollaro in più', aka 'For a Few Dollars More' (1965).It is generally considered one of the best films of its kind ever made, a masterpiece, one that almost inexplicably continues to get better with each viewing. In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in its realistic portrayal that sometimes, crime DOES pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good DOES go unrewarded.This film ushered in a new concept of a previously all too oft told Western story, probably tolling the death knell for the traditional American-made, Good guy/ Bad guy, White hat/ Black hat Western that was so prevalent before it.The three main characters of the film are as powerful as Leone's brilliant vision of the Civil War era America, he used as their backdrop. Lee Van Cleef ('The Bad') is evil in the flesh. Beedy-eyed and totally ruthless, he believes it only takes one thing to be successful: whatever is necessary.Clint Eastwood ('The Good') is the now legendary 'Man With No Name', but 'good' only in a Western concept of non-traditional good. He has a sometimes detectable and occasionally observable sense of honor that motivates his behavior and conduct from time to time.Eli Wallach ('The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most colorful character in the film. Impulsive and full of barely suppressible rage, Tuco gyrates wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be a best friend in one scene, trying to kill in another. Tuco truly represents 'the ugly' side of human behavior.At two hours and forty-one minutes, the movie was lengthy for its day, but there's neither a single scene that seems unnecessary, nor does the film seem lengthy while viewing it. The film unfolds with a charismatic style and grace, slowly revealing more and more about each character and the film's story. The pace of the film expertly captures the flavor of the time, giving the viewer a rare peek into a page of American history come alive on film.Director Sergio Leone (who contributed to another epic of note: 'Ben-Hur' as an uncredited second unit director in 1959) manages to build a lot of sometimes unsettling tension in the film, thus preventing the longer than usual movie from ever getting uncomfortable or predictable. Every typical Western cliché possibly imaginable is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling. Of special honorable mention is Ennio Morricone's original music score, which is about as masterful and complementary as it gets, culminating in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film. The music is so rich and powerful it easily stands on its own merits, and is one of the biggest selling original movie soundtracks to date. It is impossible to imagine the film without it.'Unforgiven' may well have been the sequel to 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', the story of what eventually happened to the 'Man With No Name', and won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, and the nomination for Best Actor for Eastwood in 1992 (the film also was nominated in six other categories and won in three of those). Eastwood dedicated this movie to Sergio Leone who died 30 April 1989 in Rome, and who had believed in him early in his career.Call it 'Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il' or call it 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', but after seeing it you'll call this movie absolutely brilliant at MANY levels, including the one mentioned above by Kitchener.It is a classic like no other, and is easily one of the best Westerns and films of its kind ever made.","

A few years ago it all clicked. I became a big fan of Spaghetti Westerns and the genius of Sergio Leone. Leone was a true master. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is great epic filmmaking. There are tons of classic moments in this movie. If this movie has a flaw, it's the running time. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is a long movie that feels long at times. It's never boring but the pacing is off at times. That said, this movie is required viewing for any serious fan of westerns or film in general.","

With each trying to get the treasure for themselves, they still keep crossing each other's paths, usually resulting in plenty of violence towards each otherGlorious and classic Leone western featuring 3 wonderful characters giving us great fun as they run into and try to outwit each other. Truth be told whilst each character is critical to the plot, this is Wallach's film. His fabulous 'bad guy' with a glint in his eye turn as Tuco gets the most screen time and is a particular pleasure to watch. There are though many great scenes in the film particularly the blowing up of the bridge and the cemetery which are pure cinema gold helped immeasurably by Morricone's legendary score and the horror of the war runs throughout adding a saddening seam to the story.

"billcr12","1 March 2012","At three hours in length, the word epic can be applied to Sergio Leone's western. Clint Eastwood is Blondie, or the good, Lee Van Cleef is Angel Eyes, or the bad, and Eli Wallach is Tuco, or the ugly. He does a fine job portraying a Mexican bandit, who begins the story in a shoot out with bounty hunters. He kills two of them, and wounds the third during an escape. Blondie is a lone gunman who captures Tuco and collects $2,000 for turning him into the law. At the hanging, he shoots the rope, allowing Tuco to run away. They later meet up and divide the money. They repeat the scam several times, but Tuco complains constantly, and so Blondie leaves him in the desert and takes all the cash. Tuco later tracks down Blondie with three guys who shoot at him, but they are killed in the battle. Tuco manages to hold Blondie at gunpoint, and as he tries to hang him, a cannonball hits and Blondie escapes. The reunite and find another guy for the hanging con, but the rope isn't shot and he dies. Tuco then marches Blondie into desert again with to die. Blondie asks for water for giving Tuco information about the name on a gravestone where Confederate gold is buried. Further adventures take place until the apparent final resting place of the gold is reached and there is a Mexican standoff. Eastwood and Wallach are standouts as the pair of gunslingers, and Leone just lets them rip. Patience is required for this western, but it is worth the journey.","

"chrisjcousens","15 July 2010","The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is rightly called a classic. Regardless of where you place it in your own list of the greatest films ever made, it will most likely be near the top. And that is what makes this such a classic – it is more than just a damn good Western. It is a damn good film.Plot – simple. There is some buried gold. Three lawless gunslingers are after it. They continue to run into each other and this gives the film momentum during the first two hours.So much has already been written about this film that it is impossible to sum up all of its influences and innovations. The haunting whistles of the first moments of the title sequence are instantly recognisable even to those who have never seen a Western. Clint Eastwood is instantly recognisable in a career-making role. No matter your verdict, this is an immensely important film.Director Sergio Leone has a sense for painful irony. 'The Good', Eastwood's character, begins the film by double crossing his partner (Eli Wallach's conflicted Tuco, 'The Ugly') and leaving him in the desert. This irony goes to the level of sight and sound. As 'The Bad' (Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes) tortures his victims at a Civil War P.O.W. camp, he orders the other prisoners to play their instruments to drown out the screams. The expressions on the faces of the musicians speaks volumes, and is more affecting to a modern audience than the scenes of torture themselves, gorged as we are on Saw and Hostel. It is this attention to storytelling detail in every frame of the film that makes it so rich and deep. How film-making has changed.While the film is long and slow, it has to be. The tension built up in the early parts of the film is punctuated by brief flashes of action, but it is the waiting before the action sequences that grabs you by the insides and slowly squeezes. There are ideas and emotions being played with in this film that cannot be quickly explained or unravelled, and these need the full three hours of the film to come to their conclusion. With the luxury of time, Leone is able to make a shared meal as tense and troubling as the moment, hands on guns, before a shootout.Even if you think the middle sections of the film dragged somewhat (philistine!) the finale is something special. In so many ways, it is the perfect climax to a film filled with moments of brilliance. There are too many parts to the film, too many special moments, to comment on any more, so I will simply say that this is a film I should have seen long before I did finally watch it. It is a film that, if you haven't seen, you should as soon as possible. And if you have seen it, a second, third or fifty-seventh viewing is in order. This film has quality that we are not given the privilege to see very often.","

"gregory_quinn","28 July 2015","Of the ""dollar trilogy"", this is the last, and for me, certainly not the best. The plot line is meandering and it's simply too long for the content. By the time that both Eastwood and Leoni had gotten this far, they had both ""made it"" in professional terms. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly was the first studio (UA) financed film that Eastwood had starred in and Leoni had produced/directed. Eastwood's role as the man with no name was beginning to jump the shark in this movie and he correctly decided not to appear in Leoni's following movie, Once Upon A Time in the West. For sure it contains iconic scenes, which are often beautifully photographed, but also contains sadistic violence, which even now I find shocking. Part of great filmmaking is plotting an adventure that lasts mosts people's attention span of about 90-120 minutes. This is a 60 minute story in a 180 minute movie.","

"drqshadow-reviews","20 June 2011","The high point of the Spaghetti Western sub-genre, Sergio Leone's dubiously-titled masterpiece is a living, breathing encapsulation of everything that made its peers so notorious. Whether you're after atmosphere as thick as smoke, tight-lipped anti-heroes, charmingly bad audio dubs or a cast of thousands, this grand adventure delivers in excess. With a run time of just under three hours, it should go without saying that the narrative sprawls at times, yet expert cinematography, intriguingly era-authentic landscapes, a variety of fresh, varied locations and rich characterization keep the picture from stagnating even when it's been ten minutes since the last line of dialog. Naturally, Leone regulars Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef bring the goods as remotely feuding foils with a penchant for sharp, icy glares; though I preferred their dynamic in the preceding For a Few Dollars More, the two make for a stunning combination whenever they share the screen and it's a shame this marks the end of that brief partnership. It's a terrific picture if you've got the time to really pore over it, but works equally as well as simple background noise.","

The Bad guy is bad and the Ugly guy is ugly.) to the unrealistic shooting (every bullet hits its mark exactly, whether it's one-shot kills, shooting hats off without leaving a mark, or shooting through ropes to prevent hangings), to too much the utterly dislike-able Eli Wallach chewing up the scenery, to the string of unbelievable coincidences (wagon comes by with one guy just alive enough to tell Tuco where $200K in gold is, but 'Blondie' - who was near-dead and some distance away - the specifics), etc. etc.This spaghetti western needed more meat and less sauce.

"dee.reid","14 November 2011","The legendary ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" It was a long time coming - ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964) was good, ""For a Few Dollars More"" (1965) was better but the best of Sergio Leone's ""spaghetti western"" ""Dollars trilogy"" was/is ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" released in 1967. The last film in Leone's ""Dollars"" trilogy is best remembered for two things: for truly being the best film Leone was capable of directing at that time, and for making star Clint Eastwood a household name (he'd been rising overseas due to his starring roles in the two previous ""Dollars"" films). (Eastwood, of course, wouldn't become a big-league Hollywood star until ""Dirty Harry"" in 1971.) The legendary ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is set during the Civil War, and concerns three men's quest for a fortune in Confederate gold buried somewhere in a cemetery. The three men are: The Man With No Name/Blondie/""The Good"" (Eastwood), Angel Eyes/""The Bad"" (Lee Van Cleef), and Tuco/""The Ugly"" (Eli Wallach). All three have itchy trigger fingers but therein lies the problem: they all know the secret to the location of the buried Confederate gold (one knows the cemetery, but not the grave; another knows the name of the grave but not the cemetery). This film, in its full-length unedited 179-minute running time, may very well be the first epic (spaghetti) western, or at least, the first epic western that I've seen. It's one of the most thoroughly engaging, action-packed, and provocative films I've ever had the pleasure of watching. At center stage is star Clint Eastwood, playing the ""Man With No Name"" for the third and probably last time, and he's at the top of his game here as a truly bad-a** anti-hero. Sure, he speaks softly, but he carries a big six-shooter and he knows how to use it! But don't overlook the contributions of co-stars Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach. It's been a while since I've been so thoroughly captivated by someone as truly evil and sadistic as Van Cleef's steely-eyed killer Angel Eyes; there is also something to be said about Eli Wallach's portrayal of the unkempt, desperate con man Tuco, who also serves as this film's comic relief. Leone was at the peak of his skill in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" clearly the best film of his ""Dollars trilogy."" His love of wide-angle shots to capture the oppressive desert landscape, and intense close-ups of the actor's faces were unmatched here. It's also the best film of his to make truly excellent use of the extensive talents of the brilliant Italian composer Ennio Morricone (I'm listening to his score for this film right now as I type this up).It only seems fitting that as the western film genre's most iconic star, Clint Eastwood would go on to make his dark, violent anti-western ""Unforgiven"" in 25 years later in 1992.10/10","

"UnderTheScene","7 June 2023","Sergio Leone has perfected ""Spaghetti Westerns"" with his masterpiece ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". Produced with arguably one of the greatest and most iconic scores ever this film manages to build perfect tension and set up every scene for success. Accompanied by fantastic performances by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef who manage to carry their own weight equally on screen as well as beautiful scenery and cinematography helped to makes this feel authentic. From beginning to end I was never disappointed and highly recommend everyone to view this film even if westerns are not your cup of tea.","

"mjneu59","23 November 2010","The quintessential Spaghetti Western put some teeth back into a dying genre, recognizing the American Frontier for what it really was: a patchwork of legends and lies best recreated through broad exaggeration. The result here is a ruthless, violent, oddly skewed facsimile, spread out across a Techniscope landscape with enough dramatic flourishes to suggest a larger-than-life parody. The title roles are played, respectively, by Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach, who steals the film with his brash comic performance, but the real star to emerge from the film was director Sergio Leone himself. All of his now familiar stylistic tics are on display: the portentous wide-angle compositions; the sweaty close-ups; and the director's trademark, patented gun duels, featuring ten minutes of relentless crosscutting between beady eyes and itchy trigger fingers, while Ennio Morricone's classic music score builds to a typically overwrought frenzy on the soundtrack. The body count is surprisingly low (not including the soldiers killed during the geographically imprecise Civil War battle scene), and Leone was already learning the power of myth, testing the waters for his next and last great Western epic: 'Once Upon A Time in the West'.","

Clint Eastwood stars in his iconic ""Man With No Name"" role, this time around listed as ""Blondie"" in the credits. This is the great director Sergio Leone at the top of his game. And it has the all time greatest film score by Ennio Morricone.This movie is a grand, epic masterpiece. There is a reason it's one of the top rated movies in IMDb. It must be the larger than life characters. Or the beautiful cinematography in vast Western settings. Or the aforementioned greatest film score ever. Or that distinct style of Sergio Leone film making - where everyone has an interesting face even if not conventionally beautiful - where it's almost like some kind of Italian opera. If you have any kind of interest in classic movies, you need to see this one.","

"WhatsYourPoint","7 July 2006","I'm going to start this review by saying this: there is not western that can compare to this, hell, there may not even be any movie that can compare to this. Only a handful come to my mind, and it's a very small handful at that.Sergio Leone's classic western provides the perfect ensemble of cinematography, direction, acting, story, and last, but not least, music. Leone's film about three greedy men in the search for 500,000 in gold exemplifies the dirty west. This is not your typical American western, where the sun-drenched west is romanticized. No, it's dirty and rough, just like the west was. If anyone wanted to watch the film that is the antithesis the ""chick-flick,"" I would recommend The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.Clint Eastwood reprises his iconic Man With No Name in this final film in the Dollars Trilogy. Lee Van Cleef returns from A Few Dollars More; however, he plays a different (much different) character. The actor who steals the show has to be Eli Wallach. Wallach, a western veteran, plays Tuco with great viciousness and humor, making him likable and unlikeable at the same time; he truly is ""ugly."" Leone and his cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli pack the film with great shots of the west, from the tired sands of the desert, to the endless graves of a cemetery (which was actually located in Spain). Ennio Morricone combines Colli's lush cinematography with the greatest score ever put onto film. From the easily recognizable theme, to the sad Story of a Soldier, to the excitement of Ecstacy of Gold, this soundtrack has it all.What more can I say? If you haven't seen The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, see it now! I can not press you more. This is one of those films that could be considered perfect, or the closest to perfection. A classic that shall never be forgotten; a classic that shall always be admired.","

"axopnk","13 July 2005","There are a lot of westerns made but this one takes the cake. I loved tombstone but this movie had it all. You really don't appreciate this type of film or Clint Eastwood until you watch a really crap ass film like ""Hang Em High"". Before anyone watches any of clint's films you have to watch a fistful of dollars, for a few dollars more and then The good the bad the ugly. This story is just awesome on so many levels, it keeps you watching every minute (even though it's a 2 hour and 40 minute film). The best part is no part really drags, its all toward the main purpose of the story. Watch Hang em high and you'll see a traditional American western get dragged out (i can't stand that flick.) Anyways if you want to watch the film that made westerns popular as well as western games (Red Dead Revolver) watch this film! By the way, the draw at the end is the probably one of the best and creative draws i have ever seen in any western","

"thesar-2","11 April 2015","Whew. What a week. Just spent the last few nights watching the Dollars ""Trilogy"" for the first time and only because they're deemed classics. Not my brand of movies, but for the most part they were good, with my absolute favorite, by a landslide, A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, or ""Part 1."" Not to say this wasn't good. It certainly was and tremendously better than ""Part 2,"" FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. Interesting story, some unexpected humor, a fantastic score and real good characters portrayed by both Eastwood and Wallach. Definitely went on too long, as each movie in the sorta trilogy got progressively, and unnecessarily, longer. Probably by minor opinions, UNFORGIVEN was my first Clint Eastwood western and remains my favorite of his. On a side note, it sometimes makes for unintentional hilarity, when your first introduction to either a theme or cliché in a spoof or homage. Much like: I watched the AUSTIN POWERS movies first and repeatedly long before I watched all of the James Bond movies they mimicked and unfortunately, that made the Bond movies often hilarious when they weren't meant to be. Here, I saw and heard a lot I've already experienced many times in Quentin Tarantino films. I was like, ""OH! That's where that's from."" Haha. I digressYeah, I liked it, but none of these movies will I ever see again. If you're into westerns, specifically Spaghetti Westerns, you might enjoy these. But, only then.","

"bat-5","3 February 1999","The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is the most ambitious of all the ""Dollar"" films.  The backdrop of the Civil War aids in this epic that involves three characters, all out to find a stash of Confederate gold.  Leone piles up the images, outdoing himself each time.  Morricone's score is one of the most memorable scores ever written.  The final shootout in the dry lake bed is filled with tension that is so thick you nearly fall off of your seat anticipating the outcome.  A great film, that will only get better with age.","

"ShootingShark","9 September 2008","Three separate mercenaries drifting through the US Civil War in 1862 hear about a cache of looted Confederate gold, rumoured to be buried in a cemetery. Picking up clues, and with many criss-crossing adventures en route, they each make their way to the treasure. Can they find it, and who will emerge alive ?The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, or Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo to give it it's proper name, is simply the finest western ever made. Many accused Leone of being a hack; he made westerns, but he made them in Spain, and he wasn't even an American. Not only was he not a hack, he made pure cinema - a genre stylist unburdened by all the boring moral constraints of so many westerns (clean-cut good guys, white supremacy, social responsibility). As a result, this film is the purest distillation of the western myth, with the most amazing cinematic treatment ever committed to film. Its style is beyond criticism and its influence cannot be underestimated; Leone's themes, his camera angles, his use of music, his intuitive widescreen style, his moves, his incredible closeups - all have been and continue to be copied by lesser men. At a time when everyone was making crappy new age films like Barefoot In The Park and Georgy Girl, Leone was going back to his cinematic childhood of Gone With The Wind to create an astonishingly mythic epic which is the greatest depiction of the American Civil War despite not being about it. The three main characters are larger than life in the best way possible; Eastwood is extraordinary as The Man With No Name here, his character gradually mellowing from the hardened bounty-hunter he was as he witnesses the horrors of the war. If you do not cry at the scene near the end where this hardest of hard men dispassionately comforts a dying boy you are truly heartless. Wallach is amazing as Tuco, giving one of the greatest physical performances I have ever seen, all darting eyes, fastidious little movements and operatic comedy; he can be scary, funny, vicious and tender, all in the same scene. Van Cleef on the other hand is the purest depiction of black-hearted evil in any film. His introduction, as he rides a black horse out of a desert sundown and commits three horrific murders is amongst the greatest screen villainy of all time. These three incredible turns are all-time career bests for three astonishingly talented and prolific actors. Also superb are Guiffrè as the doomed drunken Yankee Captain Clinton, Pistilli as Tuco's brother Pablo and Brega as Wallace, Van Cleef's burly henchman (Brega plays similar heavies in the two previous Dollar movies). The other unforgettable element to this movie is Ennio Morricone's astounding music, which I think I must say is simply the greatest score ever recorded. There is no movie I can name with better, more original or dynamic music. The music is in unique harmony with the images and emotes from the first note to the last crescendo. The music completes every scene. It is lustful, haunting, touching, humorous, ominous, grandiose, suspenseful, operatic, delicious, magnificent, riveting, quiet, melancholy and philosophical. There are too many great musical moments to mention, but perhaps the greatest of all is the L'Estasi Dell'Oro sequence as a crazed Tuco runs amongst the graves of Sad Hill accompanied by the silken soprano voice of Edda Dell'Orso. Morricone is probably the most gifted film composer who has ever lived - he is certainly the most prolific - and this is the finest of his many many great scores. In an average movie I hope for maybe five strong scenes with atmosphere and originality. In this long movie, every single scene, bar none, is a brilliant little vignette, yet each flows into the other with perfect rhythm. What else is there to say about this extraordinarily beautiful film ? It is a diamond, an absolute diamond of world cinema, made by one of the few truly original directors, and don't believe for a second anyone who tries to write it off as trashy or simplistic. It contains so many moments of pure storytelling genius it would take me forever to list them. It is a great story, an astounding assault on the senses, a hugely entertaining masterpiece and an everlasting testament to Leone's total command of cinema. Featuring exquisite photography by Tonino Delli Colli and fantastic sets by Carlo Simi, it was shot at Elios Studios in Rome, in Castilla-Leon in northern Spain and in Leone's favoured locations in Almeria. Stunningly well written by Agenore Incrocci, Furio Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni and Leone. Re-mastered and re-released in 2003, with several additional scenes which didn't make it into the original US release, notably a sequence where Tuco reunites with his gang and one where Angel Eyes visits a ruined fort. Trivia - Eastwood/Blondy is the good (buono), Wallach/Tuco is the ugly (brutto) and Van Cleef/Angel Eyes is the bad (cattivo); the latter two are often transposed in much of the English-language publicity and merchandise for the movie. This is the great Sergio Leone's best film, the best film of the sixties and the best western ever made.","

"Witchfinder-General-666","17 October 2005","Sergio Leone's ""Il Buono, Il Brutto Il Cattivo"" aka. ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" of 1966 is, beyond doubt, one of the greatest movies ever brought to screen. Period. I lack the words to express my admiration for this film adequately, but i'll try to indicate how brilliant this film is. This film is pure cinematic perfection. The story, the brilliant directing, the impressive cinematography, the unique atmosphere, the ingenious score, the great characters, the unforgettable performances, the dialogue, the wit, the violence,... everything in this film is pure perfection! This is one of the few movies that actually deserve their high ranking in IMDb's Top 250 list, and if I was to make such a list, ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" would rank even higher. Leone's brilliant directing and a superb cinematography come along with what is maybe the greatest of Ennio Morricone's unique soundtracks. Each one of the three leading actors fits perfectly in his role. As in the movie's two predecessors, ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" (1964) and ""For A Few Dollars More"" (1965), Clint Eastwood ('The Good')is the epitome of coolness in his role of the Man with No Name (who actually always has a name - He is credited as 'Joe' in ""Fistful Of Dollars"", his character is called 'Monco' in ""For A Few Dollars More"", and he is referred to as ""Blondie"" in ""The Good The Bad And The Ugly""). Together with irascible MexicanTuco ('The Ugly' brilliantly played by Eli Wallach), he rips authorities off by collecting the reward, that is set on Tuco's head and then saving him a very second before his execution.Since I first saw this Dollar Trilogy as a kid, the word 'coolness' is linked with this character played by Clint Eastwood. No other character in any other film is embodies coolness the way The Man With No Name does in the Dollar trilogy, and no other ever will.Lee Van Cleef ('The Bad'), one of my personal favorite actors of all-time, and one of the true icons of the Italian Western, is brilliant in the role of Sentenza aka. Angel Eyes, a ruthless assassin who knows no mercy or scruples to achieve his goals. While all of the three men are selfish crooks, and all of them selfish and violent in getting what they want, Sentenza is truly evil, and Lee Van Cleef plays this role with absolute brilliance.The arguably greatest performance, however is delivered by Eli Wallach as 'The Ugly' Mexican bandit Tuco. Hot-tempered, irascible, savage and yet crafty, and sometimes sadistically vengeful, Tuco is a criminal with an immense crime record and an immense talent to survive hangings (with the help of 'The Good'). Eli Wallach's performance as Tuco is ingenious beyond comparison. Wallach plays 'The Ugly', his anger and rage, his quick, violent temper and brutality, his savagery but also his craftiness with a unique brilliance. Wallach's performance is not only THE single greatest performance ever in a Western, but, as far as I am considered, also one of the greatest performances ever in a movie. Set in one of the final years of the American Civil War, somewhere in the southwest of the US, ""The Good, the Bad And the Ugly"" tells the story of these three men, who are on the hunt for a case carrying 200,000 dollars in gold, buried somewhere in a graveyard.Each of the three men wants the gold for himself, of course, but since none of them has all the information they need, they have to work together in order to get it. Although all three of them are reckless and sneaky, Clint Eastwood (despite to being an antihero and crook that shoots a lot of people, the Man With No Name shows some mercy and charity in comparison to the foregoing movies ""For a Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"") is rightly referred to as the Good, Eli Wallach, playing the angry thug Tuco, is the epitome of (the) Ugly, and Lee Van Cleef is wonderfully evil and ruthless as The Bad.""The Good, the Bad And the Ugly"", a Spaghetti Western at the genre's best, is a brilliant movie full of violence and dark humor, a film full of wit and pictures that will make a great visual impact on everybody with taste, a masterpiece going along with one of the most brilliant scores of all time. This is not only a film that every cineaste should see this is a film that EVERYBODY MUST SEE! If I was to name my favorite movies of all-time, ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" would be one of the strongest contenders for Numero Uno! In one sentence: ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" is one of the greatest films ever made! Absolutely essential and brilliant beyond comparison! 10/10","

The third for me was just a shade under, due to a larger epic feel and the fact that apart from the most memorable title track, the musical score was not consistently as great. When i say great, I mean to the genius level of the former 'Dollar' Westerns. Still there are heaps to love about this and the uncut version (only recently available in the U.K) really makes it less of a comedy and gives it more of a darker, cutting edge. Brutal in parts, it's another masterpiece by Sergio.L.","

"antoniocenteno-87266","25 January 2020","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Where to begin reviewing this movie?. This is one of those movies that you can speak for days and not be over with all the many good things it did, is almost crazy to belive that this movie was panned by critics at the time, probably a response to a product of it´s time but from another country, we should agree. However critics where proved wrong with this movie and had to appreciate a Western that in many ways was more revolutionary and arguably better than anything produced in Hollywood.Sergio Leone Direction for this movie is iconic and now one of the things that distinguish this type of movies, with beautiful and slow cinematographic long shots, extreme close ups, the storytelling he used and how graphich it was visually (At the time), but most iportant the build of tention he did in so many scenes, when you know something gonna happen but you have no idea when would happen, but when does happen it marks the movie and your life.The acting in this movie is very underaprecciated in general, the main Trio has so much presence by them selves that they stole every inch of screen they are in, Ellie Wallach as Tuco is funny yet ragging, charismatic and just enbodies ""The Ugly"" as a word better than anyone has done; Lee Van Cleef as Sentenza ""Angel Eyes"" is so menacing, there´s no scene including him that make you think contrary, his incarnation of ""the Bad"" is just that, someone that appears to have no soul and would kill twisting his own rules at bennefit; and finally Clint Eastwood as Blondie, ""the Good"" that isn´t exactly good, a bounty hunter that has dubious moral codes, he is so unpredictable in what he is gonna do and how he is gonna do it, yet has some good in him and is the smartest of the trio, not to say the better gunslinger (in all movies arguably). The rest of the supporting cast does a good job at it, never outmatching the main charachters but doing really good carachterization and making the film have more weight, the shop owner, the soldiers, the Generals, the killers, all of them have a poruse on the film and add something special to the film.The Score is another big one of this film, Ennio Morricone is a genius mind and there´s no better man to writte music for this genre of film than him, he easly outmatches most composers of Western movies and composers in movies in general. His score really put you in the mood of the scene, in how you are supossed to feel the film, in how raw the life was back then, the Main theme, Eacstsy of Gold, The Trio, the Sundown are great pieces of music, that´s how movie themes should work and how they have to make you feel.This movie really broke the rules of typical film making as well, is one of those movies that don´t really care that much about the plot, wich in any other movie would feel wrong, but this one makes their scenes so heavy and so much happens on screen at the same moment that the plot becomes almost a non factor for the film, is a movie about circumstances that happen to their carachters and how they deal with them in that exact moments not really caring when it would get to the end of the plot, is much more about their stories and what they leave behind, however there is a plot but the film don´t rushes into it, it takes it´s time to get there and is so satisfying.We already talked about the acting, but it´s worth talking about how this movie was one that popularized double sided charachters, specailly with Tuco and Blondie, it really don´t let you make up your mind about what you feel about them, the only thing you know is that they might be bad or good any moments, specailly that of the Man with no name, altough Wallach´s acting stole the show, Eastwood is one fo those presence actors that just need to put a cigar in his mouth and he will change movies forever and his charachter in this movie, cold, smart, few words spoken, and overall bad ass really changued movies to this very day, there´s so many movies that stole that concept and implemented into their own, not only in westerns but in action movies and Sci-Fi, there would not be Han Solos, Snake Pilskims or even Indiana Jones withouth the grandad of dirty players wich was Blondie.There´s too much to talk about this movie again and most of all is positive to excelent, so whenever you have the chance go and Watch it, is the final instalment of the Dollars Trio or the Man with no name trilogy, yo surely won´t be dissapointed.","

"sme_no_densetsu","13 April 2009","Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is perhaps the finest 'spaghetti western' ever committed to film. It was the final entry in Leone's 'Dollars' trilogy, which made a star out of Clint Eastwood. Here, Eastwood ('the Good') and his partner in crime, Eli Wallach ('the Ugly'), have to work together in order to locate a fortune in buried gold while Lee Van Cleef ('the Bad') hopes to get in on the action too.This trio of American actors leads the pack on the acting front, though it is perhaps unfair to compare them to the Italian actors whose lines were dubbed. To me, the dubbing (while it is typically pretty good) is the film's biggest flaw.Leone's direction, on the other hand, is top-notch from beginning to end. His signature style, mixing extreme close-ups and wide shots, is in evidence throughout. Also worthy of note is the iconic score by Ennio Morricone.The story itself is an entertaining one. Even though the film clocks in at nearly three hours and Leone really takes his time with some scenes the film doesn't drag at all. The plot does venture into seriousness occasionally but mostly it's just an engaging yarn about three rogues pursuing a fortune in gold.The film is currently ranked at #4 in IMDb's list of the top 250 films of all time. While I wouldn't rank it that high I do think that it deserves a spot somewhere in the list. It is undoubtedly a must-see film, especially for guys.","

"winner55","25 June 2006","(NOTE added, April '07: Since writing a review on this film, I've been paying close attention to references and allusions to it in other films; I will now make a tentative assertion: this film is the single most influential commercial film in cinema history. Literally hundreds of films make allusion to it or attempt to imitate it - films made in Hollywood, Japan, China, the Phillipines, India, Mexico, Argentina, Germany, France; both commercial films and offbeat independents; comedies, ""B"" sci-fi movies, and ""A"" suspense dramas; films by hacks and films by recognized masters. On top of that, the film really redefined how actors are photographed, how dialog is written, how scenes are shot and edited, the whole narrative structuring of a motion picture, and the composition of soundtracks. Not bad for a ""spaghetti western"", huh?)(First review, June '06:) Some readers may remember that, in the year before he at last surrendered control of the Turner Broadcasting Network, Turner had this film played once a week, with hardly any commercial breaks. Now that's love for you.This is definitely a ""guy"" film, which means that it doesn't do justice to 51% of its potential audience. However, it is as close to perfection as any guy film could possibly get.I would add most of the original Italian release additional footage available on the DVD. But this is one of the films not a frame of which can be cut without serious damage.How did Leone accomplish this? It is largely due to his close cooperation with Ennio Morricone, the finest Western composer after WWII. Although they were not to perfect their working relationship until Once Upon a Time in the West, the opening sequence of this film - where the yelp of a coyote is heard in the same tones as the whistle of the title music - announces that we are here to enjoy as many of our senses as film can reach, and in a manner just coordinated enough that we can allow ourselves to be swept along without concern for time.I will also say this: Until recently (for reasons I shan't get into), I have been a pacifist most of my life. It happens to have been this film that convinced me that war is a ""waste of good men"", as Eastwood's character remarks.Which reminds me to remind my reader - this is not a Western - it's a war movie; an anti-war movie. And far more powerful, as such, than all the crappy ""anti-war"" movies Hollywood churned out to please the hippies in the '60s.The ""hippies"" ended up voting for Bush's fiasco in Iraq. Clint Eastwood, despite his conservative politics, has (as a filmmaker) become obsessed with the horror of violence, and the hope that somehow we can rise above it. Me too.","

Together with Ennio Morricone's powerful, truly original, and unforgettable score, they have created an iconic film. Eastwood and Wallach are both perfectly cast and create rich and deep characters that I really enjoyed. This is a serious film dealing with some serious situations, but Leone very adeptly sprinkles it throughout with just the right amount of humor. I disagree that this film is slow paced and instead consider it to be evenly paced to a degree necessary to achieve the desired result.","

"bobsgrock","27 October 2008","Sergio Leone's epic tale of three men all on a different point of the morality scale is a thoroughly entertaining film that is certainly one of the best in its genre, if not one of the best films overall.Clint Eastwood completes his ""trilogy"" of roles with Leone as Blondie, the quiet drifter who has few friends and plenty of bullets. In every scene, Eastwood's quiet yet brutally tough nature shows that he is one of the brightest stars of the last fifty years, and even though he has gone on to become a better director than actor, he still deserves to be considered a great actor.All the acting is terrific, with Lee Van Cleef perfectly intimidating as the hit man Angel Eyes, and Eli Wallach stealing the show as the comically-violent bandit Tuco. They carry the story along and Leone paces it so well that even though it is quite long, it is well worth it to see the final sequence of the showdown between all three characters.And of course, we cannot forget to honor the man who made this series possible. All throughout, Sergio Leone shows his enormous talent as a director and filmmaker. He certainly changed the genre forever with this film, and that is just one reason of why this may be the best Western ever made.","

"oneguyrambling","27 January 2012","First up for a spaghetti Western this doesn't appear anywhere near as hackneyed and half-arsed as the label might lead you to believe. In fact the blu-ray I rented looked pretty awesome.The tale of the three titular desperados is long and elaborate. How long? How about 3 hours long. Long enough to have two on screen deaths and a full meal eaten before a line of dialogue is uttered.The Good is Clint Eastwood, a rough n tough cowboy who plays as fair as you play him. He sports a perpetual three day growth and an equally permanent short cigar propped out of the corner of his thin lips.The Bad is Lee Van Cleef, a dodgy soldier on the lookout for a man with one eye, for reasons that I will explain later.The Ugly is the only guy with a name used regularly, Tuco (Eli Wallach). In fact Tuco is pretty much the star of the show, though Good n Bad get their moments.Good, Bad and Ugly are eventually all in pursuit of the same target, stolen gold coins, the whereabouts of which are only known to a one eyed soldier who sports a patch.The greater part of the film plays like those riddles where the farmer must get the chook, the fox and the wheat from one shore to the other without something eating something else, only he can only fit one thing in his boat at a time. The Bad knows the location of the gold, the Good knows not the location but specifics once you get there, and the Ugly is the key to bringing all loose ends together.Each of the grimy trio spend ample time getting to know – and beat the shtuffing out of – each other. They take turns leaving each other for dead and at various times all seem to hold the upper hand, only to have it taken from them.There are loads of close ups highlighting shifty eyes, many slow drawn out scenes including what must be the longest Mexican stand off on history, and I must say the makeup jobs were quite well done. As the film is set in the US civil war era some of the settings are surprisingly intricate and feature a cast of thousands of well costumed extra, further dispelling any notion that I had of a 'spaghetti Western' being a cheap knock-off, and though the length and long periods of inactivity were a little different to my modern day ADD sensibilities I was rarely bored, which in a three hour 45 year old film might be the strongest recommendation I can give.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. I wish I could explain it better but the circular sounding whistle that forebodes every gun fight (and parody) know to film originated in this film. If you only watch once Western this year – or this decade – you could do a lot worse than this.","

"Cosmoeticadotcom","7 June 2012","The Good, The Bad And The Ugly features one of the best film scores ever, by Ennio Morricone at his creative greatest, and it soars in the way it's applied to enhance even the most routine scenes; dazzling cinematography, by Tonino Delli Colli, including some of the best and most realistic battle scenes ever filmed; and well written and well acted characters, by the Good- Blondie (Clint Eastwood), and the Bad- Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), this film is dominated by the Ugly, Tuco Ramirez, the Mexican bandito played by Eli Wallach. The character is sort of an even more stylized riff on the bandito, Calvero, he essayed in The Magnificent Seven, which saw that character absorb some of the lunacy of the samurai played by Toshiro Mifune in Seven Samurai; but that's what makes it even better. It's simply one of the greatest comedic performances in film history. He owns the picture, much in the same way as the Lee Van Cleef character owned For A Few Dollars More, and like Van Cleef's character, in that film, Tuco often outsmarts the Eastwood character, One simply cannot turn away, lest miss a sight gag or joke or wince of frustration that sets the screen alive. Much of this is due to the fact that Wallach is, simply put, one of the best and most versatile actors of the last six decades, but much also has to be granted to the film's screenplay, penned by Leone, Agenore Incrocci, and Furio Scarpelli, from a story by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. It crackles with depth, humor- especially quotable one and two liners, pathos (see the scenes with Union and Confederate soldiers), and rage, and is one of the rare films that deserves the moniker epic.The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, despite some flaws, is a great film, for it is so engaging and well written that it moves far faster than its three hour time, actually 'feeling' more like a 90 minute film; an effect that often occurs in the long and slow films of Bela Tarr. From its opening credits to its end the film never takes itself seriously, which helps mitigate said flaws, and the trilogy, as mentioned, and as a whole, is probably the best example of an artist recognizing his own flaws and correcting them with each subsequent film. This trend would reach its apex in Once Upon A Time In The West, but it started here, in this trilogy. Watch all three films, and especially this one, to see the proof that the terms 'high art' and 'fun' are not mutually exclusive. Now, get going'!","

"bkoganbing","7 October 2015","Bearing in mind that I think westerns are an American art form and I have an aversion to the European made ones, Sergio Leone's The Good The Bad And The Ugly has a lot to recommend it. Not the least of which the impact it had on Clint Eastwood's career making him an American icon.The Good The Bad And The Ugly follows an odyssey of three men, two of them a pair of lowlifes and the third no better than he ought to be in a search for buried gold. It's quite the odyssey that Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef in those title roles have in search of the loot. A minor theater of the Civil War is operating in the west and all of them get caught up in it as well.Clint Eastwood developed and honed his laconic and cynical character who was in fact a good guy. Which gives you some idea of the bad guys he faced in his western films. Note that Clint Eastwood also never returned to the spaghetti western after this film.Van Cleef is his usual mean self, perhaps exponentially so. One thing about him is that he's a hired killer with a strong work ethic so I guess that counts for something. When he takes a contract he follows through. As for Wallach he dusts off his Mexican bandit characterization that served him so well in The Magnificent Seven is dusted off and embellished. At one point he's got Eastwood at his sadistic mercy, but when he learns of the loot, Wallach's greed gets the better of him.I don't consider this the great classic that many do, but The Good The Bad And The Ugly will satisfy most western fans.","

"dreaujyc","8 June 2020","There are many Sergio Leone's movies fans in Eastern Asia. Although we don't have a history of cowboys and rangers, but it is familiar with swordsmen who may be evil sometimes but also get rid of the cruel. I love the dollar-trilogy very much but the third one is quite different. When the bounty hunters were involved with the war and did some help to stop a bit of unnecessary casualties, it levelled up the whole movie and made itself more serious. Clint Eastwood was so manly and attractive at the prime of life, many of our young fellas are happily imitating his way of talking, but unfortunately, we don't have revolvers to play with. What makes it more interesting is the masterpiece of the OST composed by the great Italian composer Ennio Morricone.I love all the OSTs of the dollar-trilogy but this one is the best. It is quite stirring and dramatic when Tuco rushed himself among the graveyard with the BGM of Ecstasy of Gold. The final duet is also classic.","

"harryplinkett14","17 October 2014","Morricone's stunning score is too good for Leone's film. Now, the acting is good, the casting is perfect, the idea is great. So what went wrong?For one, it feels dull. It has a slow pace and often times it becomes irritating. Moreover, some of the scenes have little, if any relevance for the plot. This has an alienating effect on the audience.Another problematic thing is the humour. The film tries to insert humour quite often, but these attempts by and large fail and scenes come across as silly rather than funny. Too often one is left feeling disappointed that the punch line failed to materialize.The action scenes are quite dull as well. The huge numbers of extras in uniforms and all the guns and explosions fail to create any real sense of war. They remain as a rather pale mat painting in the background. As for the revolver duels, they too are surprisingly dull. Granted, the final showdown is quite memorable, but the others are unfortunately rather unimpressive.There is also a lack of logic, which is quite frustrating. There is little in the film that makes sense, the decisions made by characters are often absurd, and the audience is left wondering what actually happened and why.Regarding protagonists, 'the ugly' steals the show, while Eastwood is not given enough things to do. His character remains undeveloped, although Leone makes some attempts to give him depth. Also, the antagonist is not menacing enough. He is given too little screen time and never manages to be a genuine threat.Unnecessary gratuitousness. This is something Spaghetti Western is known for, and something I tend to dislike. There is a scene where Tuco is beaten about in order to extract information from him, and this goes on forever for no reason. Throughout the film there are moments where we are forced to endure protracted, often violent scenes that may seem grand and intense, but carry no emotional punch and have little relevance in terms of advancing the plot. Leone does this time and again, and it is clear that he experiences these scenes in a way that is peculiar to him, but which remains a mystery to many viewers. Too often I feel that he is aiming for an emotion I simply do not experience while watching the film.I will not go on about what else is wrong. I will conclude with some more positive things. As I said, the music is superb and does wonders for the film. Also, I like the general tone. His depiction of the warring parties may be inaccurate, but Leone does manage to create a sense of dread and disgust. The scene in the graveyard, accompanied by Morricone's score is excellent. The counterpoint between the greedy misfits in search of buried gold and the solemnity and horror of the huge graveyard littered with graves of men who died for their ideals is quite effective.The story is definitely a good one, shame the actual script is too weak and Leone's sensibility and sense of humour are, at least in my view, somewhat peculiar.","

"DarthBill","23 April 2004","In his third and final go around as the laconic Man With No Name, Clint Eastwood (the Good) reluctantly joins forces with bandit Eli Wallach (the Ugly) to find Confederate gold and only killer Lee Van Cleef (the Bad) stands in their way.The Good - memorable spaghetti western music (title theme, Eli running through the grave yard, the death of the soldier, the stand off), Clint's stoic loner routine, Lee Van Cleef's killer villain routine, Eli Wallach's scene stealing performance as the rascal bandit Tuco, usual dose of morality tale told against the harsh western landscape.The Bad - Too long, too slow, not a lot of energy except for when Eli Wallach is on screen, and even Eli can only do so much to keep the film lively.The Ugly - Not a whole lot, though I preferred ""A Fistful of Dollars"", which was made on a smaller budget.As a trivia note, the theatrical trailer incorrectly build Eli Wallach as ""the Bad"" and Lee Van Cleef as ""the Ugly"" even though in the film Lee Van Cleef is ""the Bad"" and Eli Wallach is ""the Ugly"".","

"Lambysalamby","14 May 2015","Well first off, having seen so many films, I'm not sure why I waited so long to watch this but I'm glad I finally did, and you should too! It's unbelievably clear to me now where Tarantino borrowed his camera shots and editing techniques from in the likes of KIll Bill and Inglorious Basterds! (I knew about Morricone)The film was years ahead of its time, but I have two gripes with this movie that stopped me from giving it the full 10/10. 1: The dubbing- All the foreign actors acted their roles in their native tongues which were dubbed over afterwards. It was quite noticeable and threw me off a bit, I'd much rather a foreign film with subtitles than dubbing any day.2: A tad too long. I do feel the running time could have been shaved byt 20 mins.Having said all that, it's a great film! Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is outstanding and the ending is spectacular. Overall opinion: Milestone!Other films from the time I rated 9/10: Cool Hand Luke. Bicycle Thieves. The Italian Job","

It's amazing how each of the three man represents the different types of people who lived back then in the wild west: the ugly represents the cunning man. The bad represents the gangsters and criminals of the old west and the good represents the only people left in the wild west to do good and what's right - for the right price ;). All three man try to survive as the civil war takes over everything. Great script, great actors and one spectacular finale sequence at the end.","

""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" (""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" in English) is more of an epic than the first two, but no less intense. Is there a way to watch the whole end sequence and not feel your heart flutter?Even if you haven't seen the movie, you've probably heard the pulse-pounding theme song. It's one of the most iconic pieces of music ever (not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino hired Ennio Morricone to do the music for ""Django Unchained""). It matches up perfectly with the setting and action. That plus the subtle performances and Sergio Leone's masterful direction make this one movie that everyone should see.","

The only thing that makes it different than other movies is that it does it with style. All three of them are of course brilliant. They were given many cool dialogues. Ennio Mariconi's music does half the work. You probably must have heard it. It brings more style and character to the story. Each of the three acted well and lived up to their pet names. Simply by looking at them makes you feel that it's great.If you have not seen this movie, don't waste anymore time in reading these reviews.

"olcayozfirat","17 February 2023","It is a 1966 western movie. The subject is legendary, the director is legendary, the acting is legendary and the music is beyond legendary. Good in the movie, not good. Bad, not bad. Ugly isn't ugly either. Tuco, who is already called ugly, drags the movie. The true story of the man is built on pain. Her conversation with her brother is heartbreaking. I think a movie could be made just about this character. He is actually pure and sympathetic. He is ruthless in his fad moments, but like the other two characters, he is incapable of making plans. Bad is the dictionary meaning of charisma. Disciplined enough to do his job properly. The good character is slippery. He makes a deal with the criminals, delivers them to the law, gets the reward, then frees him from the rope, splits the money, and gives it back to the sheriff in another town.All the music of the movie is signed by Ennio Morricone and is magnificent. The intros are flawless. The scenes are remembered for their music. My favorite is the L'estasi Dell'oro music, especially when Tuko searches for the name in the tomb.The movie has great jokes and funny moments. One percent smile until the last scene.There is no sex or nudity in the movie. It can be watched with family peace of mind.","

"keltonkhouse","4 March 2023","This was my first spaghetti western. Since I watch other films of the same genre. And is not bias because it was the first. This is just a great movie. It is the best western. Sergio Leone is a great director. He can make a scene really suspenseful and engaging with just silence and closes ups on the actors faces. He can make a characters face tell a story. The score by Ennio Morricone can elevate those scenes and moments to another level. His music and score is iconic and memorable. Leone and Morricone are fantastic and shouldn't be overlooked. The pacing is great. It doesn't slow down to much in this almost three hour film. Nothing dragged or felt out of place. The main trio of actors are amazing. Clint Eastwood as Blondie or The Man with No Name and his co star's Eli Wallach as Tuco and Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes respectful. Each actor was very unique in there roles. Wallach is a huge stand out. He plays this very dirty and ugly character with such energy and fun. Cleef is the perfect casting as the main antagonist. Eastwood is a stoic wanderer, he plays his character with a cool calm collective manner whilst being a smart badass gunslinger. The dialogue is great with many memorable lines. The characters are memorable and unique. The cinematography is very solid. The way some shots are framed is very creative. And the final is easily the most memorable and iconic western imagery in the western genres and film in general. The music elevates this moment so much. It's gripping and intense and will leave you satisfied. A great film everyone should watch!","

"JS-War17","28 November 2019","I am a huge fan of old spaghetti western films, and there is no one who does them better than the likes of Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood. These two men despite have a language barrier were able to create several amazing westerns that have set the golden standard for macaroni westerns.I want to start with Casting... Clint Eastwood is a bad ass, there simply is no denying it. He is the Badass cowboy that will steal your girl and in the same instant earn your respect, and I have nothing other to say than he was born to play the role of Blondie. Now he also had a great lineup of supporting actors who helped him gain such acclaim but they just don't hold a candle to Mrs. Eastwood.There is also the plot which is a like a headphones cord that is so tangled that the audience is forced to watch as Sergio Leone slowly untangles each separate knot, giving the appearance of separate stories but inevitably straightening to reveal that it is intact a single line. Now it may not be a complicated nonlinear story with loads of flashbacks but Sergio Leone proves himself a true filmmaker by unraveling a story rather the simple telling the audience the events that take place.Finally I want to touch on the score. This to me is where the movie really shines, because despite all the cowboy reality it is the score that connects the story together. Building tension with every whistle and drumlins, changing the simple shots into something meaningful. It is not an understatement when I say that this score is the single most iconic score of all time.I am giving this movie a 9/10 because this to me is more than just cinema, it is emotions caught on 2.35:1. (My favorite cinematic aspect ratio)","

I also liked that this starred Clint Eastwood; he was a great cowboy movie star ala John Wayne and Gene Autry. Some of my favorite parts included action with guns, getting down hanging people, and best of all, the bridge explosion, which required a lot of time, effort, and work to do!

"gigan-92","23 January 2012","A+ The undeniable pinnacle of Spaghetti Westerns, and one of the greatest films of ALL TIME. This movie slouches nowhere and every aspect of it is masterful. Clint Eastwood is back as ""The Good"", this time known as ""Blondie"", and is as great as ever. Lee Van Cleef returns as well, but not as Mortimer. He plays ""the Bad"", Angel Eyes; a completely different character. Angel Eyes is cunning, obsessively brutal and if you look closely maybe a psychopath. You've got to admire Cleef's capabilities as an impersonation actor. He's a whole another character than he was a year ago in ""For a Few Dollars More"". And Eli Wallach ""the Ugly"" a.k.a. Tuco, a truly great character. One might presume him as the comedic relief, and while definitely hilarious, that's hardly his role. The writing gives him depth, even a peek into his younger years which is why the writing is so great. And before I delve elsewhere, let me be clear this installment is indeed a prequel.Many other great characters appear in the film, like the sadistic Corporal Wallace played by Italian actor Mario Brega , the left-handed gun-slinger out for revenge (Al Mulock, R.I.P.), who serves as the basis for one of the greatest lines of all time, courtesy of Tuco:""When you have to shoot, shoot! Don't talk."" Aside all these, my favorite would have to be the Union Captain, played by Aldo Giuffrè . The character is not a reflection of only great acting, but also serves as the symbol of what the whole movie is about.The focal point of the movie would definitely be the devastation that war brings, and the many live sit tends to waste on useless efforts. All three of the titular characters, though motivated by greed no less, can't look away from the mutilation before their eyes. This tragic theme is brought out to its fullest by Ennio Morricone, our composer. This has got to be one of his best scores ever, the rawness of it. He captures the fighting spirit beautifully. One of my favorite scene sin film history would have to be when Angel Eyes finds the battered Confederate regiment, and the glorious cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli actually shows the villain step out of the darkness, even if only for a moment, to observe the plight of the soldiers. The music really adds to it, but enough. After all there is a limit to how you can write on IMDb.Anyways, this film sports truly awesome characters, clever writing, beautiful cinematography, and a timeless score. And oh yes the greatest gun-slinger duel of all cinematic history. It truly is director Sergio Leone's finest hour.","

"xiaoli7377","29 December 2022","Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is undeniably a very classic film. An iconic soundtrack. Very iconic scenes. The birth of the spaghetti western. The launch of Clint Eastwood's career. One of the many films that was partially responsible for the demise of the Hays Code in Hollywood and which gave rise to a new era of cinematic art through the 1970s to today. All of this is undeniable.And the film itself is quite excellent. The cinematography and editing and directing are all somewhat of a masterclass on film making here. This is one of the most beautiful films ever shot; a spaghetti epic that runs nearly three hours long.And that's part of my criticism with it. It feels a little bit longwinded. The pacing is slow. Many scenes that I feel are somewhat superfluous. The soundtrack is great but we here the same musical sequence like at least ten times in the movie, that crying harmonica. The dubbing is also pretty bad at times.I love it but I'll admit it's a little flawed and it's not something that I'd consider rewatching over and over again. It's a great film but at the same time it just doesn't really connect with me personally like I know it does for others.","

"emperor_bender","9 May 2008","If you want to see a good spaghetti movie, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is probably the move you're thinking of.3 sides, 3 people, 1 excellent film.The Good: Clint Eastwood plays Blondie, who is quite possibly the most interesting person to ever grace a Western movie. Blondie is so mysterious, laid back, quiet, sly, sneaky, and tricky. But at the same time, he does what he knows is right, and will not rip anyone off unless they had it coming.The Bad: Lee Van Cleef plays Angel Eyes, who is quick to show that he is the bad guy. Angel Eyes is very educated, well-connected, sly, and very determined. Angel Eyes pulls a lot of strings to get what he wants, and will stay on task until it is done.The Ugly: Eli Wallach plays Tuco, a sleazy, sniveling, thief. Tuco is very sneaky, and usually will steal from almost anyone, including his own partners. However, as evil as Tuco is, he also has a good side. He does occasionally do what is right. Although it is sometimes still in his own benefit, he will still go out of his way to do it. And this cross between good and bad is what makes Tuco such an interesting and well-liked character.The story is very winding, but in a good way. Some parts make you wonder if you are still watching a spaghetti movie or not.With a long (but still very interesting) plot, great characters, and many excellent scenes, The Good, the Bad and The Ugly is sure to please western fans of all kinds. The movie deserves its place at #4 on IMDb's top 250 (as of 5/9/08).10/10","

"dumsumdumfai","10 September 2008","like Lawrence of Arabia, I saw this in infomercial free late nite TV. Sometimes in French, sometimes in English. At times, the lip synch is distracting, but so is the drama - or melowesterndrama. part of that is the civil war sub theme and the swelling orchestral music (not to compare with the mother of them all - Once upon a time in the West), but to a teenage boy, the opening score can instill a myth.And what a meandering, and nicely drag out story too - stole away entirely by Eli Wallach's sinister laugh and squinty eyes, imitating Clint's ? It's more like siesta western in my opinion, long lazy, hot and dirty (the dusty feel) that is.All culminating in a tense 3 way stand-off and a humorous ending. Man, that is an gutsy ending. this is movie made for pre-teenage boys - fluffy, heroic, funny and a bit of smarts.","

"dommercaldi","6 October 2020","Pros:
1. The score is phenomenal, particularly the iconic theme which gives you chills whenever it plays.
2. The cinematography is fantastic with the wide shots showing off the beautiful scenery, and the close-ups upping the tension.
3. The set and costume design is brilliant thus making the world-building perfect and entirely immersive.
4. The make-up is terrific, especially in regards to Blondie's (Clint Eastwood) blistered face.
5. Both Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach (Tuco) give great performances.
6. The action scenes are wholly entrancing and they're brilliantly choreographed.
7. The humour is dry but hilarious, and it's intelligently placed thus it never feels forced or inappropriate.
8. The atrocities and horrors of the American Civil War (1861-1865) are handled deftly, which allows for some genuinely heart-warming and tender moments.
9. The last 15 minutes can be summarised as succinctly as this: perfect cinema.Cons:
1. The sound-mixing is a little dated, especially in regards to the dialogue.
2. Some of the dialogue is slightly too cheesy.","

"denis888","20 July 2014","Serfio Leone was never my cup of tea - his spaghetti westerns are schematic, prolonged, protruded, childish, silly and slow. This horror of a movie lasts for unbearable 3 hours and makes it painful and slow. Nobody saves the film - even Clint Eastwood seems to be utterly bored, Wlach is at best bemused, and even the superb soundtrack by Enio Morricone does not help deliver this devastating bomb of terribly long and slow close-ups, unnecessary silly dialogs, inconclusive battle scenes, meddled plot and gray, dry, grainy tempo. This gray, sandy, grainy landscape illustrates the film's misery best of all - it is not captivating, nor does it manage to hold attention for a speck of time. It just rags along ploddingly and leaves no place for any serious delivery or dynamics. Do not watch this meddle, waste of time merely","

"vostf","7 November 2002","...to watch them again every other year with great delight. Alas, after a few frames you know you perfectly remember every single scene. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is such a feast people should be entitled to discover it more than once over a lifetime. Actually you can watch it again with friends, have your children enjoy it for the very first time and that's big time yet!I recently headed for the 175min version, showcased as the 'Original Italian release version', hoping to catch up with the pristine of the first sprightly running. And the winner is... not me for sure but the well devised marketing babble.First the original version makes no sense when you know the dubbed movie so well, plus Italian doesn't fit westerns when it's not your mother tongue. But most important, among the fistful of minutes more (14 exactly), you get only transitions scenes, which, at best, slows down the general pace. For example the first (and longest) patch only offers a square caveat of the gloomy war background Leone wanted to depict. So it heavily echoes the later scenes with wounded soldiers in the mission and dissolves the shock of the bridge battle scene where the horror and stupidity of war is much more striking. But the main flaw is it's only about Sentenza and Van Cleef displays the same experimented humane type he played in For a few dollars more while he is supposed to be The Bad in this movie.Shorthand: don't bother about the bloated 175min version. It's kind of a 'sneak preview' which Leone decided to trim after the initial release, so IT IS NOT a director's cut but only the last step before the final cut. A step that shouldn't appeal to you unless you're a cinema archaeologist with a sweet tooth for deleted species. And The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is now and again fresh and alive.","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","27 September 2004","This, the third and final part of Sergio Leone's famous ""Dollars"" or ""Man with no name"" Trilogy was promised to be the epic chapter; that proves to be entirely true. However, despite Leone's talented direction, the film seems to drag in some scenes, and the length is almost unbearable on multiple viewings. The plot is very good, intricate, yet simple enough for the mainstream crowd; the way it keeps developing through twists and unexpected situations is also great. It keeps your interest, at least the first few times you see it. The pace is bad in some scenes, where the movie seems to drag on endlessly. I don't think I've been able to sit through the whole thing more than once(granted, technically that's enough, but a film should have some re-watch value, I think). The acting is very good; Clint Eastwood is the embodiment of the spaghetti-western spirit. Lee Van Cleef is excellent as well, as is Eli Wallach. The characters are well-written, interesting and credible. The direction is, as always when it comes to Leone's films, excellent. Apart from the few scenes where the plot drags, Leone keeps a great atmosphere and mood throughout the film. The action is about as good as it gets when it comes to spaghetti-western: excellent, intense and very, very cool. The dialog is excellent. The script is well-written. The soundtrack is among Ennio Morricone's best work. All in all, if you're into westerns at all, this is pretty much *the* western. It drags a little too much in a few scenes, though, and is probably best enjoyed if you only see it once. I recommend it to any fan of westerns, particularly spaghetti-westerns, as well as any of the three main actors, or Sergio Leone. 9/10","

"jameslipski","17 August 2012","What can I say about this magnificent epic film that hasn't already been written or spoken? Saw this first as a teenager in the 1970s and was glued to the TV along with my two brothers. Great story, acting, scenery, and the score is fantastic. Clint Eastwood plays the Man with No Name who along with Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach hunt for a stolen cash box filled with gold coins buried in a cemetery during the American Civil War. They each know only one part of where the gold is buried so they have to keep each other alive despite the fact they want to kill each other. This 3 hour movie moves along gracefully and never gets boring. The final cemetery scene and standoff between the three main characters is riveting. Once again the score is unforgettable. Yes I have seen this film over 100 times and love every minute of it. Not only a great western but one of the best films ever made!!Watching this great movie again on TCM in 2016. The difference is they now play the restored extended version with an additional 25 minutes included. These ""new"" scenes makes the story even more riveting and tie in some loose ends. To the director Sergio Leone all I can say is thank you for your talents.","

"zeekwunlau","17 April 2020","At the end of the trilogy, it can be seen that due to the rising budget, one of the trilogy's narratives is more magnificent than the first one: the first is a single-line narrative of a single scene (town), and the second is a single-line narrative of a multi-scenario ( The goal of chasing the bounty), to the last part is a multi-scenes multi-line narrative, and even put it in the context of the Civil War, quite the taste of western epic. It also reached the apex in the soundtrack, not only has the extremely classic main theme, but also other long soundtracks have very good melody.The story tells three people. The ugly, the bad, the good have a common goal: a treasure chest with 200,000 gold coins hidden. This goal is essentially the same as the reward object. The first two know half of the information, and Dongmu Hold the other half of the message. Contrary to the second part, the rhythm of the first half of this part is slow, and it suddenly became tight when it entered the battlefield. The final three-person duel is also 100 times more exciting than the previous two-man or one-to-many duel, because you ca n't guess every Who will shoot first?The ugly is undoubtedly a comedy character, he is funny, but also quite ambitious. The bad is indeed bad, and it is no wonder that in the end, the other two will choose to fight him first. Our Dongmu is still a decent one, and the conversation with the other two is quite the first to stir up the gang.The addition of war scenes is to my understanding that the director's aversion to violence is a concentrated manifestation: Western cowboys are fighting each other for personal money, and even paying the price of their lives. It seems so naive and worthless in the face of the death and injury of war. And this tragic battle is only for a broken bridge that is meaningless to the non-commissioned officer, why not ironic.In general, this is a magnificent movie. With the support of funds, the scene, soundtrack, story and other aspects have reached a new height, leaving a paradigm for the later Western movies, and also cleverly included Director's thoughts on violence, justice and other topics","

"jimjo1216","29 December 2009","The setting: the American Southwest (Texas?) during the Civil War. The set-up: three gunslingers wander through the war-torn country in search of personal gain.Lee Van Cleef is a hit-man (the Bad), Eli Wallach is a bandit (the Ugly), and Clint Eastwood is a lone gunman with scruples (the Good). Wallach's and Eastwood's stories are intertwined, and they eventually meet up with Van Cleef, although he disappears for long stretches of the film. The saga is long and drawn out and the characters are put through a lot in their quest for riches.But I'm not sure that's what the movie's about. It seems to preach the gruesomeness and pointlessness of war, showing wounded soldiers, some who've lost their legs or arms on the battlefield. The three main characters are just passing through. They have no allegiance and their outsider's point of view helps emphasize the absurdity of all that meaningless killing. I wonder if the gunmen's quest is merely the framework for an anti-war movie...Still, there's plenty of gunslinging action, as well as cannonfire and explosions. This Italian-made western is a pretty big production. The biggest of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, yet, following the low-budget ""Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For A Few Dollars More"".If Eastwood's ""man with no name"" in Leone's ""Dollar Trilogy"" is meant to be a single character, this film (the final of the three) shows the birth of that man. This is where he acquires his iconic poncho.As far as westerns go, this isn't the usual John Wayne cowboy fare. If you've seen Leone's earlier westerns, you have an idea of what to expect, except this movie is different even from them. It's not about saloons or cattle trails, cowboys or Indians. It's not even about a ruthless villain that must be stopped. It's about three men all looking out for themselves and all after the same thing. Three men who don't trust each other and who can handle a pistol. The movie is violent, but fun. It takes place across many locations, right in the middle of Civil War action. The war is the backdrop, not the Old West. The whole thing is not quite like any other western film I've seen.IMDb currently rates this as #4 on its Top 250. I don't know if I'd rate it that highly after my first viewing, but it's good. There are many effective stretches with sparse dialogue and the film is full of black humor. There are several memorable sequences. An enjoyable watch.","

"TheNabOwnzz","3 May 2018","As Sergio Leone was cementing himself as a great director after the excellent Yojimbo remake 'Fistful of Dollars' and the incredible 'For a Few Dollars More', with 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' he has managed to reach his quality climax. With a lot of close ups, gorgeous landscape cinematography & stylish drawn out tenseful gunfights all of Leone's trademarks are clearly visible. Yet why is The Good, the Bad and the Ugly even better than his other masterpieces? The three main characters are ofcourse the stars of this show, with each putting in an exceptional performance, especially Eli Wallach as the eccentric bandit Tuco. Clint Eastwood & Lee van Cleef's natural acting talent show that there is no need for useless dialogue to insult the viewers intelligence, facial acting is an even more impressive kind of acting, and with van Cleef and Eastwood, they had the two best in the business. The little dialogue also gives the viewer a chance to listen to the absolutely incredible musical orchestrations by Ennio Morricone, which is always in a natural kind of harmony to Leone's direction skills, resulting in absolutely graceful scenes that delight the eyes. The dialogue that is there always seems to further the story or enhance character development ( specifically in Tuco's case ), and not insult the viewers intelligence. It even includes a parody on one of the most common Hollywood clichés when Tuco says: 'When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk!'.Unlike Leone's previous films The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is set during the American civil war between the Union and Confederacy, and a lot of small subplots feature this war. Leone shows a sarcastic view on the purposelessness of the civil war in this film by putting the three main characters in its midst while maintaining its own personal story about greed. The alcoholic Union captain shows this perfectly, with his fed up view about the brutality and the senseless deaths of the civil war, or Angel Eyes's trip through a confederate hospital showing all the wounded as Morricone's dramatic music plays. As for morals, we see the nametags of the title of the movie added to the three characters, yet don't really see all three of them as more than common thugs at the start of the movie. However, the civil war changes this, showing Blondie a man of compassion when faced with a dying soldier, to whom he shares his cigar. A little gesture of great moral worth. Also showing Angel Eyes's indifference with his stolen identity as a fake Union sergeant only to further his own personal greedy agenda. Tuco is shown after the meeting with his brother to be forced into the way he is now, and even though he is a vulgar, dirty, ugly ( no pun intended ) character Leone manages to make him likeable when he is influenced by greed. Thus one of the greatest decisions Leone made was having the setting during the civil war, as its part in this story further enhances character development and brings up questions about the senselessness of it all. The blowing up of the bridge could be seen as the greatest ironic statement of Leone against war.Yet the primary story still consists of finding gold in a certain cemetery, as a personal study of greed. This concept alone might not seem so spectacular, but Ennio Morricone's haunting score, the beautiful desert landscape cinematography, stylish gunfights and the brilliant acting results in an incredible primary story aswell. It is one of the films with some of the greatest final 15-20 minutes ever put to screen, resulting in a large payoff deserving of such a quality film. In the end we truly begin to understand why the tags 'Good', 'Bad' and 'Ugly' are stated in the beginning of the film, as all of the characters have evolved to their respective states during the affairs in the civil war. This is excluding Angel Eyes, who is shown to be evil, dressed in black, from the start, but that makes sense since Leone wanted to show the differences between the three characters in a morality contest during the film, and as Blondie and Tuco changed, Angel Eyes had to be different from them.All of this cements The Good, the Bad and the Ugly as one of the greatest films ever made, and the greatest western ever made, since it tackles so many different kind of themes. It is one of the greatest pieces of entertainment, yet also tackling morality problems and making anti-war statements.","

"Insane_Man","7 March 2022","Three gunmen, one is, ""The Bad"", looking for the man who buried gold in a secret place, one is, ""The Ugly"", who knows the name of the place, a cemetery, and one is, ""The Good"", who knows the name of the grave where the golds are buried. Now all these three gunmen must reach the cemetery to get the gold in the midst of the Civil War.The genres are, Action, Adventure, Comedy, War, Western.The three gunmen are, Clint Eastwood, The Good, unnamed but called as Blondie, a bounty hunter. Eli Wallach, The Ugly, named Tuco, a wanted criminal. Lee Van Cleef, The Bad, a contract killer, hitman, assassinator, unnamed but called as Angel Eyes.This movie seems so interesting from the very first scene. But this scene will tighten the viewers with their seat. Which scene? When Tuco and Blondie discover a horse carriage loaded with dead bodies.Lee Van Cleef survived 64 years, died in 1989. Eli Wallach survived 99 years, died in 2014. Clint Eastwood, still alive, age 92 (2022). The genius director and writer Sergio Leone survived 60 years, died in 1989. The musician Ennio Morricone survived 92 years, died in 2020.I mentioned these information because I made a little thesis about the most important characters & crews in this movie. I read the trivia, the goofs everything. Because which movie I liked, I read about them. I mentioned Ennio Morricone, the background scorer of this movie, cause he is one of the most important person who make this movie great. His music makes this movie more enjoyable and more interesting.The character, Blondie, the good, is the hero of this movie, top billed fastest gun fighter. Whereas Tuco, the ugly, the funniest character and at the same time so dangerous, has the most screentime. But I liked the character ""the bad"" by Angel Eyes most. 'Cause I liked his personality most, mostly the way his face is, solid face.Overall, one of the most enjoyable films I have ever watched. One of the most stylish movies in the world. More than greatest cinematography and background score made the movie a finest cinema in history. Visually stunning for the costumes, the location, the war, the cemetery (which will make you say, wow).Recommended 100%.Watchable with the whole family. Can be rewatch again and again. Watch it to believe it.","

"ragosaal","23 October 2006","I really couldn't understand most of the reviews here that place this film as a great western or even the best ever for some fans. In my opinion this is just a watchable and good western, but not much more than that.I think the only possible explanation would be that IMDb reviewers consider ""spaghetti"" westerns a sub-genre within the western genre. If that is so, ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" would probably stand among the best (if not the best)in the ""spaghetti"" westerns ranking. But the point is that in my opinion there are no sub-genres within the western genre. So I analyze this film just for what it is: a western film.In such terms, this film has its moments, fine open-wide outdoor locations, good action gunfights (though hardly believable) and an acceptable plot. Good acting too mainly in Eli Wallach's Tuco.But what really demerits this movie is its incredibly unnecessary overrun; there's no way the story can stand almost 3 hours in duration and so the development is definitely slow. Overruning has always been a characteristic of director Sergio Leone; he sort of engages madly with some sequences and he goes on and on and on at it (the final duel here is an example with all those unnecessary close shots in the men's faces and eyes). Another clear sample of what I'm saying was the incredibly long -and even boring- opening sequence of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", where Leone takes more than 10 minutes in the opening sequence where three gunmen are waiting for Charles Bronson at a train station.Come on guys, let's face it. ""Spaghetti"" westerns are ""B"" movies and even if at the very start they could have seemed sort of original and somehow enjoyable, once you take an honest critical look at them they're not great films but just good a few of them but no more than that. Sorry again.","

The three separate stories really are well written with each others character getting their own spotlight without it seeming difficult to understand. The shots were very suspenseful usually have long shots or close-ups with a cool soundtrack. They give everyone such a charming and unique personality that builds off perfectly with the story.This was my first Western movie, but I'm tempted to watch more because of how great everything was in this one.","

"TheHande","14 November 2009","In The Good, The Bad and the Ugly Sergio Leone perfected his epic western. It's key is the trio of main characters who all bring something different to the table and all serve as integral ingredients to a film that might appear a mere adventure film on the surface, but which is both a comedy and character drama as well as a great war movie at the same time.Clint Eastwood's the Man with No Name, this time called Blondie, continues somewhat on the more ruthless note he took on from the previous film (For a Few Dollars More). However, he's not a truly malicious character but more of jerk-friend who is also extremely observant and at the end of the day doesn't stab anyone in the back so hard that they wouldn't get up again. This creates his rather odd relationship with Tuco.Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes is the very embodiment of evil as far as characters go. He wipes anyone who's in his way, is entirely devoid of any morals and generally manages to create a menacing mood with his presence. This is a stark contrast to the character he played in the previous film and made all the more unsettling by the fact that his appearance is almost identical to this character from the previous film, right down to the pipe.Eli Wallach as Tuco the Rat is easily the most memorable character from the film. Appearing at first filthy, amoral and without any redeeming qualities he is suddenly thrust into a wavering partnership and later, one could even say, a type of friendship with Blondie. We find out that there is more to Tuco than meets the eye though he never stops being the seemingly greedy scum that he is at the start, by the end of the film the viewer is even able to sympathise with him to a degree.What truly sets this film apart from other westerns and as well as the rest of the Dollars trilogy is that even in its close-to-three-hour length, the film doesn't feel excessively long. The length is justified. You 'want' to spend the 170 minutes with the main cast of characters.","

"drunken_munki","12 September 2020","Hello friends. I am a long time IMDb user and in October 2020 it will have been for 15 years. After watching the Mulan (2020) remake I sat here and I wrote my review in mild disgust. I then proceeded to evacuate my bowels for 45 minutes in a strange but calming grip of horror that maybe the mastery and art of cinema is completely dead.However, what comes to mind is the Ojibwe saying from 'The Sopranos', which is: ""Sometimes I go about in pity for myself, and all the while, a great wind carries me across the sky."" I also realised that I haven't made many written reviews, even though I have watched and rated as of right now 2,781 titles.In any case, I had decided to celebrate 15 years of me using IMDb by reviewing all the titles that I have rated a 10 out of 10 perfect score. A change of pace. A palette cleansing. There aren't many titles, mind, as I have noted here only 8 that fit the bill... out of 2,781. There are of course a whole bunch of good titles that I have given a 9/10, and I will probably list those later on.So here we go, the 8 titles that I gave 10/10 are as follows: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), The Sopranos (1999-2007), Jaws (1975), The Shield (2002-2008), Seven Samurai (1954), The Shining (1980), Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), and finally The Passion of the Christ (2004).The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. This is an adventure, with crazy characters, good music, a backdrop of civil war, and most of all a treasure hunt.I love the character development in this title, each of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly have their own motivations, and mix in a whole load of grey area in between. I can't really explain it, but these three characters might be some of my favourites. I want to feel sorry for Tuco, but he's a wild animal. I want to root for the man with no name, but he is so ambiguous. I feel as if Segio Leone knew what he was doing in this regard, a commentary on the psychology of man and in particular the time period of the frontier west.The attention to detail is ahead of it's time I feel, the longshots, and the rapid editing in the showdowns. This has been copied and copied time and again, but Lerone did it first I feel. His camerawork and positioning are top notch.I love the backdrop, and I love the composition of music, scenery and atmosphere. This is masterful and well balanced. I'm almost certain he has encoded the 7 sins in this movie as well. Story wise the three main characters intertwine several times and end up on the same goal of finding the gold coins. I can't understand how well this plays out and the slow burn to the final showdown is just pure genius. I love this movie, and will continue to watch it until I die.In any case, this is a perfect 10 out 10 film, certainly the best 'Western' ever created.","

I have been a devout fan of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY for the better part of fifty years. Basically, it's a tale of human nature at its worst, and under the worst conditions possible --the desert expanse. In rides the legendary Man With No Name, superbly played by another screen legend, Clint Eastwood, who must deal with two bandidos, equally played to the hilt by Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. The rest is cinematic history. A morality play, true, and then some, but an exercise in film-making at its very best, with superb character development, a dynamic script and excellent casting, right down to the bit players. A true labor of love. An interesting side note is that Italian director Sergio Leone may have taken notes from Alfred Hitchcock's films, and incorporated them into his western series, as there is, most definitely, a black comedy side to this classic that will stick with you for awhile.

"ZookGuy","27 April 2007","The Good, The bad, and the Ugly is a great film. You can't find a better Clint Eastwood movie where he just does he acting (not acting and directing like in 'Million Dollar Baby' which, in my opinion is just an inch better.) Casting no-names for Tuco an the Bad (I can't remember his name) was a humongous risk, but it pays off. This is a film needed for you to buy on DVD. All of the actors (including the family at the beginning, who got killed quickly into the film) were superb. This film told us what it was doing and when, they didn't make curves, the plot was straight forward. This film does definitely deserve the number four rank in IMDb's Top 250 Films. But when you think about, it should be number one.","

"Artimidor","26 June 2012","Watching a Sergio Leone Western is like sitting down for dinner Italian style the way Leone enjoyed it: You've got the whole family there, its slow but keeps coming and coming and the whole affair eventually lasts for hours - but you savor every minute of it.Part of the family are: Clint Eastwood (""the Good"") of course in his third and final installment in a Leone movie, Lee Van Cleef (""the Bad"") and Eli Wallach (""the Ugly""). Viewers familiar with the Dollar movies need no introduction to Eastwood's Blondie character, the gunslinger who spells cool, but his two adversaries/companions on the bounty hunt are on par in this one. Especially Eli Wallach steals the show with his twisted opportunistic, rough, down-to-earth, yet also outright funny performance, and Cleef's angel eyes never looked better and deadlier than in a Leone close-up underpinned by Ennio Morricone's extravagant, almost surreal soundtrack. The latter is a given considering Leone's previous collaborations with the master composer, but just as Leone's understanding on filming, Morricone's music reaches a new level in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"". As for Leone: You've got it all here: The long shots over deserted lands, battlefields, hundreds upon hundreds of graves, counterbalanced by the extreme close-ups of characters digging deep into their minds and souls, plus there's the deliberate time the director takes to tell his story about greed, full of twists and turns, spiced up with irony. Unmissable.","

"JohnWelles","27 February 2009","In my opinion, this is the greatest western ever made. It's better than ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and ""High Noon"". It really is that good. All three of the main performances, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are spot on. Being the last of the so-called ""Dollars Trilogy"", you get a sense that director Sergio Leone wanted to out do his first two westerns (""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"") by having everything in it, the American Civil War, a Treasure Hunt, and the best climatic shoot-out of all time. An interesting thing to note, is that it was the first Western Epic. Running out over three hours it was the longest Western of its time.If you haven't seen ""Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo"" see it, if you have seen it, see it again now.","

"tonyjackie","5 November 2006","The first thing to say about this movie is that it is probably a prequel to the first two dollar movies.I say this because towards the end of the movie Clint Eastwood's character actually finds the poncho that he wears in the first two films. This is a great movie and in my opinion the finest western ever.I think that it has gained respect critically with each passing decade and rightly so.It comes in at almost three hours and it really does need to be that long. What is so great?The three leading actor's are all top notch here.Clint Eastwood fits the role to perfection,Lee Van Cleef oozes menace and Eli Wallach chews up every scene he is in in probably his best loved role.The story is basically a hunt for missing gold set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and is beautifully told.Then there is the music which is tremendous throughout. This is a pretty long and violent journey but boy is it worth it.The final 30 minutes of the film are tremendous and the final shoot out grips with tension.I remember the first time I saw it and couldn't believe that Clint could possibly leave poor old Tuco to hang in the middle of the graveyard and even though the character of Tuco is a bit of a swine I was really pleased Clint decided to save him after all.Watch this movie.Not only is it a great western,it is a fantastic film in it's own right.","

"deacon_blues-88632","8 April 2023","Not only is GBU one of the finest western films, it's a fine film across all genres!Whoever had the idea of casting the Jewish Eli Wallach as Tuco, the low-life bandido, was a genius! He is priceless! Perhaps the signature role of his long and illustrious career!Lee Van Cleef is the consummate villain in a seemingly effortless portrayal. You really will be filled with both fear, loathing, and curious admiration for his ""Angel Eyes"" role.And Clint Eastwood is the perfect lead star. I always wondered why Tuco chose ""Blondie"" as his character's nickname, since his character's hair is dark brown in all the scenes without a hat.The sheer sweep of the story is what sets it apart from all other westerns: small pueblo villages in Mexico, southwestern one-horse towns, civil war battlefields, desolate badlands, thriving metropolises, & etc. It's truly a film for all generations of movie audiences!","

"Dello_","24 January 2020","I really liked ""The good, the bad and the ugly"". It's an odyssey around the west in which we follow these three characters played by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef that have different paths that cross each other. As usual Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone are indescribable, in particular the last 15 minutes are outstanding as far as direction, score and also editing. And that final showdown is fantastic: 5 minutes of music and looks that keeps you on the edge of your seat, really memorable. The only complaint I have is that even if the movie is a great time, in some points I felt its length. Everything is necessary, I wouldn't have cut anything because of the setting in the middle of the secessionist war and so the movie takes its time to show the repercussions of it. But as I said sometimes I felt it too long. But that's not a big problem, indeed I really enjoyed ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" and if you like the genere you should definitely watch it.","

"nairtejas","17 September 2013","The plot is snail-paced if you consider watching it in now (2013) mostly because, many sequences have huge potential to bore the hell out of you at a time of fast-paced action-thrillers.Now the discrepancies are mentioned, the epic western movie does strike multiple chords throughout its 3 hour time-line. The amazing climax, the gun-slinging shots, the surprise action moves & of course, human nature theme are portrayed with such brilliance that you wonder how much effort went behind them. The soundtrack is one more melodious thing about it.Cast performance is fantastic & Sergio Leone's direction works wonders with the genuine locations. The story is fresh & entertains fine.

"hemant_balz","29 March 2010","The Good,The Bad and The Ugly is the best western movie that i have seen ever.No doubt,Once upon a time in the west stands on the same fame but it just towers a bit higher.This is a masterpiece from Sergio Leonne.Lets talk about the three characters in the film.The Good: Clint Eastwood raised to stardom only due to this movie.The good man may have done some fabulous roles but this one from his past is one of his best.Great acting and those cigar scenes,just everything fits. The Bad: Angel eyes or the bad or Lee Van Cleef rises to the occasion.Its just his presence that gives a dark effect to the film.He shows how to make a serious bad role into a contemporary easygoing kind of.He has the least role in the movie but still for me he was a stand out performer. The Ugly: Tuco.......Fabulous.Who is this guy?What an act?So captivating and just his greed for money that you wish you always see his acting again and again.Perfect casting for a perfect role.Here i add a fourth character.The master of Westerners.The emphatic Sergio Leonne. Sergio Leonne: Words are hard to say how i feel about him right now.He is class.Along with Ennio Marricone he has a pairing that is the best in cinema.Beautiful directed scenes and soundtrack constantly echoing in your ears.The epic scene or the penultimate climax in the end is a rare art of cinema.Such scenes just make the movie or break it.The linking up of war,blowing up of bridge,fight for money,all add different emotionality to the movie.Specially the war scenes,the death of the general particularly,a scene i can never forget.A scene with such amazing music.Words are not enough for this film.This is grand.This is magnanimous.This is far more than just a western....","

"arthera09","26 May 2010","So I did not hate this movie. I did not love it. I did enjoy it. My main problems with the movie is the music. I was sick and tired of that little piece used for blondie. It got old quickly. The other main issue with it was the whole war scene. It felt so out of place and I feel as if it gave Leone a reason to throw a schmaltzy anti-war message into the film. I did not enjoy that scene and it felt forced and out of character for both the characters and did not fit into the movie. I did enjoy the little quips between blondie and ""the ugly"". Their dynamic was enjoyable. I do enjoy the sweeping epics with huge shots showing off the landscape. I watched this movie when it was 90 out and I felt like I could really feel the oppressive heat. The desert actually felt like the fourth character in a way that does not happen that often. The acting was alright even though it was over the top. I did enjoy all of the movie with the exception of the one scene. I really liked the opening and it really showed how to slowly build tension. The movie as a whole was extremely well paced with bits of action thrown in there to keep up an overall slow movie. It never felt slow to me and I really just enjoyed looking around. Overall a good movie and maybe if I enjoyed westerns a bit more I would have liked this movie more, but I guess that is just personal preference.","

I always enjoy hearing the famous opening title theme. (it's 10 minutes into the film before anyone says anything). the film revolves around the 3 main characters, Eastwood, Wallach, Van Cleef. I thought Eli Wallach was brilliant as his role as tuco/the ugly. and Van Cleef as the the bad, with those eyes, was the perfect baddie.The film really could be summed up as 3 gunslingers on there search for $100,000 of gold coins in a grave. Wallach knows the name of the cemetery and Eastwood knows the name of the grave. Van Cleef finds out by torturing Wallach when Eastwood and Wallach accidentally become P.o.W. The 3 men end up in the cemetery where there is a great showdown, one of the best the camera zooming into all 3 mens eyes and the music as well, classic stuff. Van Cleef ends up getting shot and Eastwood and Wallach split the gold.","

"guskeller","26 April 2022","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is iconic. Its plot of bandits searching for treasure is seemingly simple, but deconstructs many ideals. The film examines notions of heroes, violence, war, and greed by presenting honest complexities. Protagonists are cruel, immorality is explained through backstories, violence is brutal, and war tragically destroys everything in its path. Thus, the self-interested characters are understandable reflections of their decaying world. Eastwood isn't deep, but Wallach counterbalances that with shifty desperation. Ultimately, this movie challenges viewers to reconsider romanticized ideals of action heroes who glorify violence in morally simplistic stories.Technically, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is equally naturalistic, yet vibrantly stylish. The production has gritty details, yet grand scope. The effects are elaborate, real, and downright dangerous. The cinematography combines picturesque wide-shots with striking close-ups. The editing slowly builds tension, yet erupts with dramatic cuts that elevate suspense. Plus, these aspects are unified by Leone's legendary direction, creating a rugged yet beautiful atmosphere that redefined cinema. Finally, Morricone's music is possibly the greatest score of all time. Consequently, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a cinematic marvel. Undeniably, it's one of the best films ever.Writing: 9/10

"Lucabrasisleeps","1 January 2009","So I have seen my first classic Western finally. This is a genre I tried my best to avoid. I am more into thrillers. But this one was special.The plot is interesting in itself. 3 men are determined to get to the cash box that was buried under the ground in a certain place(trying my best not to reveal the plot here!). The excitement is in watching the many twists unfold. The characters are known as Blondie, Tuco and Angel eyes. The real names of the characters are not revealed here. We come to know a little more about Tuco in the course of the movie. It could be said that Tuco is the central character in this movie as he appears in most of the movie. The plot moves throughout America and they go in search of the cash box even to war torn areas. The story is set in the late 1800's during the civil war. So the movie also effectively works as an anti-war movie as well.The most impressive thing about this movie is the great music by the legend Ennio Morricone. This might be the best ever music I have ever heard in movies. Maybe that's an exaggeration but surely this is one of the best. The music in the scene where Tuco searches frantically for the cash box is filmed brilliantly and the music builds into a crescendo at the end of the scene. Another aspect that impressed me is the beautiful cinematography in certain scenes of the movie. The long shots showing the beauty of the place are absolutely breathtaking. The war scenes are shot well and I was surprised to hear about the budget. With this budget I was surprised to see the advanced effects and the meticulous depiction of the war.I also came to understand a few things about a part of history I didn't know - the American Civil war. The bridge destruction scene is also another one I totally loved. The closeups of the character's faces is also another feature that I liked specifically about the movie - especially when they are actors with such great screen presence such as Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach. I have never thought of Clint Eastwood as particularly good looking or talented. But this movie proved me wrong. His performance as the calm bounty hunter with a sense of humour enhanced his image considerably in my eyes. His quiet sexiness is something I have never seen in other movies of his(Maybe I am biased because I saw only his newer movies). Lee Van Cleef is notable for his portrayal of the villain. Eli Wallach's portrayal of the crooked and funny Tuco is IMO one of the best characters in movies ever. His line ""When you want to shoot, shoot, don't talk"" has become one of my favourite quotes as well.Finally this movie has encouraged me to seek out more ""Sphagetti Westerns"" and regular classic Westerns as well. The movie is quite a classic and is highly recommended for all movie fans because it is more of an exciting adventure movie with beautiful camera-work than a Western.10/10","

Director Sergio Leone's unique use of camera - long, continuous shots at wide angles with extreme close-ups - and Ennio Morricone's unique, highly imaginative soundtrack blend to perfection. The story is exciting. There is never a dull moment. The movie is long, but Leoni's direction is so good that one can enjoy this movie for three hours. If you haven't seen this movie, rent it. If ever there was a perfect Western, this is it. Not just a great western, but one of the best movies of *any* genre.

"iccqwy","20 June 2020","I wasn't sure if I was going to comment on this film because everything has already been said by the hundreds of other people who have posted their thoughts, but I decided that I should really put my two cents in since this is my favorite movie.This film, in my opinion, is not only the greatest spaghetti western of all time. It is the greatest movie of all time. Period. Regardless of genre. I could probably watch it every day, and be perfectly happy doing so.The music is perfection. The way the music drives this movie is absolutely amazing. The musical genius of Morricone and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone is a combination that will probably never be equaled. The theme song will forever be etched in your brain. In fact, it probably already is, even if you haven't seen the movie! The scene where Tuco runs through the graveyard with the song ""Ecstacy of Gold"" is pure poetry. And the showdown at the end with that great music- just incredible.The story is riveting. There is not a single dull moment. The movie is long, but Leone's direction is so good that you will love the fact that you can enjoy this movie for three hours.Lee Van Cleef is my favorite spaghetti western actor, and he is incredible as ""Angel Eyes."" It is the part he was born to play. Eli Wallach is perfect as Tuco. He really shines in this movie. Some people say he steals the show, and I can see why they think so. Eastwood is excellent as ""Blondie,"" although I don't think Eastwood has as strong of a presence as Van Cleef (I know many will disagree, and that's OK because all three actors are superb in this film so why split hairs?).This movie is hypnotic. It's operatic. It's sad. It's funny. It's gritty. It's violent. It's art. It's action. It's pure entertainment. The film is just so incredible on so many different levels that EVERYONE should see it, regardless of what kinds of movies they are into. And it's so cool that the greatest flick ever just happens to be a spaghetti western. If you haven't seen this movie, stop what you are doing, and go get it now!!","

"williampsamuel","7 December 2014","This movie is a legend. It changed the way we look at westerns. It's been endlessly imitated and parodied, but never equaled. It made Clint Eastwood a household name. And yet, as I watch The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I can't help but feel a little sad knowing that what is perhaps the greatest of all westerns was made in Italy. Yes, this is one of the much-maligned spaghetti westerns, but it's as far above the average entry in its genre as Star Wars is to Starship Troopers, or A Hard Day's Night to Spiceworld.Surely we're all familiar with the basics of the story. The mysterious gunman Blondie (Eastwood), the rough hewn bandit Tuco (Eli Wallach), and the heartless killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) search the west for a hidden cache of gold, as the Civil War rages around them. There are countless twists, turns and betrayals, as each man realizes he can't do this on his own. You can't be sure of anything, except that before the adventure is over, there's going to be one hell of a showdown.Sergio Leone has done an exceptional job of writing and directing. There's not one line of unnecessary dialog, in fact there's no dialog at all for many long stretches. And not since High Noon has a movie been as successful at slowly building tension. Of course in High Noon, the entire movie was buildup, until the final shootout. Here, Leone gradually builds tension in a scene, and then provides a stylistically violent payoff again and again.Nowhere does he do it better than in the final standoff, where each of the three leading characters have a gun trained on one of the others. They each know that whoever wins here will walk away one of the richest men in the west, but they're also aware that pulling the trigger has a very good chance of getting both them and their target killed. And yet, if two of them where to ally themselves against the third. We in the audience are also fully aware of these facts, but the movie gives us no clue as to who will come out the loser. Leone has also produced something that is a true feast for the senses. Through use of long unbroken shots, he shows the vastness, solitude, and desolate beauty of the west. Mesas, canyon lands, endless sand dunes, and scrub forest are all lavishly photographed, as the wind whistles and dust flies on the breeze. His sunrises and sunsets are works of art. Looking at this movie, it's easy to forget that it was filmed in Europe. Leone has also added quirky touches, like the legless veteran who hangs out at the local saloon, quite literally dragging himself up to the counter, or the Union colonel obsessed with destroying the bridge he's supposed to guard, so there won't be anything fighting over and he can go home. Of course it's not just the director who's responsible a movie's success or failure. The actors matter as well, and much credit is due the leading men for their brilliant performances. Clint Eastwood has long been one of my favorite actors, and this is by far one of his best pieces of acting. As Blondie, he's as tough as nails, utterly cool under fire, and one of the most mysterious figures since Jeff Costello. There's little of his past; he's in a rather unique partnership with Tuco at the film's beginning, and there's a history with Angel Eyes, but we get no idea where he's from, or what life he led before becoming an outlaw. He doesn't talk much either, preferring to puff on his cigarette. But he clearly follows some form of personal code, and there's no doubt that he's one of- if not the- best gunmen in the west.Cleef's Angel Eyes is much more straightforward; he's the very embodiment of evil. This man has no qualms about killing. Indeed, he seems to relish causing death and suffering for its own sake, as when he smothers an elderly employer to death with a pillow, or carries out his iron-fisted rule of a Union prison camp. His every word drips with menace, and his smile is like gazing up death itself.But the most interesting character just might be Eli Wallach's Tuco. He's got a rap sheet a mile long, and he goes to great lengths to carry out his revenge on Blondie, but he doesn't have the same aura of menace as Angel Eyes. He lies, cheats, steals, and sometimes kills, but not so much because he's evil as because he has no concept of morality. He's also funniest guy on the screen. In one scene he's all sweet talk, your best pal; not that he's believable for a second. The next minute he's launching a hilarious obscenity-laced rant against you and your family. Tuco's reunion with his brother- a priest! - is one of the best comedy scenes in any western. There are other comedic touches as well, like the legless veteran who hangs around the saloons, walking on his arms, or the Union commander bent on destroying the bridge he's tasked with protecting so that the fighting will end.It's also refreshing how few clichés there are. There's no extraneous love interest, no Indian attacks or stampedes, and you never hear anyone shouting about ""gathering up a posse."" There is talking killer, but he's only a bit player, and Tuco lectures him on why you shouldn't talk when you can shoot- after shooting him, of courseBetween the acting, the action, the characters, the production values, and the originality, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is an achievement to rival the best of John Ford. Any fan of westerns, and anyone who enjoys good film should watch this one. It is truly one of the great movies.","

"michaelRokeefe","9 December 2005","THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is the final and finest of director Sergio Leone's 'dollar' trilogy. The good: Joe(Clint Eastwood). The bad: Sentenza or Angel Eyes(Lee Van Cleef). The ugly: Tuco(Eli Wallach). Joe, also known as Blondie, is a shiftless gunman with a touch of honor. Angel Eyes, is a hit-man who always gets his assignment done...usually in a sadistic manner. Tuco is a Mexican bandito always looking out for his own interest...without a conscience. These three are looking for Confederate gold worth $200,000. The cache is buried in a nameless grave...but who will be the first to get his hands on it? The finale proves borderline hypnotic as Tuco pathetically runs in circles through the graveyard looking for the hidden treasure. This surely ranks with the best westerns of all time. Other cast members: Claudio Scarchilli, Benito Stefanelli, Livio Lerenzon and Aldo Giuffre. Ennio Morricone's wonderful score will echo in your mind long after the final credits roll.","

"xterminal","15 February 2001","The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (Sergio Leone, 1967)There are a number of great things about this movie. The first ten minutes. The last ten minutes. The theme music, which has come to be synonymous with the American west. Lee van Cleef, who was great in every role he ever played.And then there was the middle hundred sixty minutes.There's an odd tendency among filmmakers to take a razor-thin plot and stretch it far too long. Such is the case here, with the plot being a race between the Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood), a hired gun named Angel Eyes (van Cleef), and the Man with No Name's on-again off-again sidekick Tuco (Eli Wallach) to find a cache of stolen gold during the Civil War. This plot meanders for two and three-quarters hours before getting on track, and that's about an hour and three-quarters too long. The subplots are never developed, nor are the characters. Tuco switches allegiances every ten minutes. After a while, it gets just plain boring.Definitely could have used a good editor. Eastwood's westerns got better with age (his, not theirs); Unforgiven and Pale Rider are better, tighter films. **","

It represents the birth, or at least one of the births, of the anti-hero in Hollywood. There are not many films where the word classic applies more than this one.Sergio Leone's direction here is just perfect. No man understood the Western genre more than he did. The movie is a perfect combination of fun, serious, and thrilling. It is perfectly written and perfectly acted. The real story here however, as most people know, is the score by Ennio Morricone. This man defined the theme of the Western Genre. No filmmaker/composer would ever be able to create a Western that did not sound like Ennio Morricone's theme. It is just perfect. Clint Eastwood does an incredible job as you expect, but it is the performance by Eli Wallach that steals the show for me.I avoided spoilers in this review because I want to try and attract a younger audience to films like these. Almost every film fan has heard of and most likely seen this movie, but there is a definite reluctance from the younger generation to watch older films. This makes sense given the popular films in the modern day, but it makes no sense if you have ever watched this film. If you are reluctant to watch older movies, this is a perfect place to start. It may open a world that you never knew existed.","

"drystyx","6 March 2007","This isn't the worst of the spaghetti films, but it is a terrible films. If you don't know what a spaghetti film is, it means, great exciting music trying to make up for a weak stupid plot, uninteresting, unlikable characters, silly comic book style gunfights, terrible writing, terrible directing, and slow paced boredom. This film isn't a complete bomb because of the efforts of some of the actors. It's no secret that Eastwood wasn't a gifted actor, and he had to be surrounded by superior actors such as Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. Those two, and the supporting cast almost make this bearable. It involves three men. One is good, one is bad, and one is the guy who took your last girlfriend away from you. But which is which? The film literally has to tell you. Eastwood is supposed to be good, but the only two not completely vicious things he does are try to save a handicapped from hanging (so he can take him to be executed again), and offering a dying soldier a puff from his cigar-not trying to stop his bleeding or even give him some pain killer, but to just do a cigarette commercial in the middle of a movie. There's no reason to care about him at all. In fact, the guy who stole your girlfriend comes across as almost sympathetic (almost.) The plot is the three are after a decent amount of gold. The trouble they go through, they could've much easier just stolen that much cash somewhere is. So the plot is ludicrous. The characters are just an example of that era's movie making in which movie makers tried to outdo each other with evil characters. Billed as anti-heroes, they don't come close to filling that role. True anti-heroes are self absorbed, maybe somewhat selfish, probably anti-social, such as in ""Hombre"", ""The Lost Continent"", and the Edmond O'Brien version of ""DOA"". These guys are just vicious punks who you would not want to be your boss, your law enforcement official, your anything. That said, there is some great music, which doesn't match up at all with the mundane events and characters. The shootout scenes are ridiculous, probably comical, and unfortunately they paved the way for a multitude of later movies that copied these inferior techniques. For exciting shootouts you really need to go way back before these movies, or to more modern movies that know better. This cannot be construed in any way as a good movie, much less a classic. You will be bored to tears if you let one of these guys talk you into watching it. These are the same guys who would take you on a snipe hunt.","

"JustHavingALook","26 December 2022","Not sure where all the raging reviews originate from...
Seems most people should learn how to watch a movie, then maybe write a review (I d suggest Talking Pictures: How to Watch Movies)Alright, let's put into context the fact this movie was released in 1966 and the production is indeed epic.From the number of extras and all the locations and the set design (especially the ending scene at the cemetery which was completely built from scratch).And yes: the score by Morricone is magnificent and became an instant classic.And yes: the editing was revolutionary with the fast cuts between establishing shots and extreme close ups .And Yes: the classic western genre of white hat / black hat is indeed represented differently (the ""good"" is just good looking, he is as bad as the others)That said: the 3 story act structure wasnt really a thing back then and it shows. I do not care about any of the characters. At all. A bit better with the ""ugly"" since he has a bit of a backstory and shows more humanity and facial expressions than the others.Plus: the dubbing is horrendous sometimes; the whole thing is unnecessary long (especially the first hour or so which should be the end of the first act); too many deus ex machina moments move the movie forward which is utterly lame; certain events are just simply unrealistic or illogical (gun in the bathtub ready to fire... come on)","

"utku_kamil_ozen","29 September 2017","After finally having watched this masterpiece, I felt the urge to write this review for young audiences like myself who have little or no interest in the western genre. Because If you haven't seen one of those films before, there is an intimidating side of them, you just feel apprehensive. To an outsider, they all look similar, as if every image you have seen about any western film belongs to one single film. They look kind of boring. And now that I have seen this film, I can tell that it was a great experience. Of course, I cannot make general statements about the genre just because I've seen one film. But seeing this broke my prejudice. And even if you feel like you can never enjoy western, you should make an exception to see this one. Having said that, I must warn you it is a slow burner. First half hour was a challenge for me, but after that it started to get interesting. So I advice patience.I also want to say a few things about the film itself. I don't know a lot of actors from old films, this may be the first time I've watched Eli Wallach. He is great in this film. It was his performance that caught my attention for the film after the aforementioned difficult half hour. I can't tell the same thing about Clint Eastwood though. I don't know if it was part of the character or something, but his acting consisted of a lot of squinting, grimacing and whispering his dialog in a monotonous speech. Story was the strongest part of the film, it reminded me of Quentin Tarantino's films, though it is not a coincidence, Tarantino is known to be influenced by a lot of western films and he named many of them as his favorites. But the dialogue is not as powerful and interesting as Tarantino's, though it is not a weakness of the film either. The main plot is complicated in the most positive way and there are a lot of details that touches your heart, like when Tuco meets with his brother and the Union Captain that wanted to hear that bridge blown up before he passes.I don't think I should talk much about Ennio Morricone's music. It is just awesome and the soundtrack is so iconic it is recognized by almost everybody regardless whether they've seen the film or not. Such a powerful music, it gives you an adrenaline rush.I am pretty sure I'll re-watch this film many times again. And because of this film, I might delve into other westerns. And I'll also look into Eli Wallach's filmography for I am much impressed with his performance.One last thing, a bizarre sensation came upon me during watching the film. I wonder if these films will get more and more irrelevant and even awkward perhaps for the future audiences. When some guy from the year, say, 3017 watches this, will he feel utterly perplexed? And not just because of what's happening, too. His frame of references will be so different than ours, he might not even get the simplest dialogues...","

"Hikalgo","22 February 2023","Iconic like few others, it is definitely my favorite western and objectively I consider that it is also the best of all, it is raw, slow and makes you tense when he sets his mind to it, Sergio Leone controls the times like few directors are capable of, he directs you where he wants and the characters are legendary, they all have their particular mystique and the last 30 minutes of the film are enjoyable on their own. No context. Simply letting yourself be carried away by the betrayal and the memorable performances that will transport you with epic and iconic music to one of the most shocking scenes in cinema.","

"Wuchakk","8 June 2017","Released in 1966 and directed by Sergio Leone, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" stars Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach as the titular three men (respectively) who are after hidden gold, buried in a Civil War cemetery somewhere. Of course, none of these men trust each other and the Civil War happens to be raging around them.There's no question that Leone created a different filmic genre by melding the hysterically overdone Italo grand opera with Spanish picaresque convention. A Spanish term, Picaro means ""rogue"" or ""rascal"", and the picaresque yarn is usually sardonic, featuring the misadventures of roguish protagonists of low stature who live by their wits in a crooked world, and told with realistic and humorous detail. Here 'Blondie' (Eastwood) and Tuco (Wallach) are the two picaros, who have stumbled upon a way to make good money claiming bounty rewards for Tuco's many sins.Someone criticized the film on the grounds that the geography doesn't look anything like the actual landscapes where these Civil War events occurred. Wrong. The events in the film take place in extreme West Texas and the New Mexican Territory. ""Santa Fe"" is even mentioned a couple of times. When Angel Eyes meets Baker, his employer, near the beginning it's in El Paso, which is 250 miles south of Santa Fe. The topography of Almería, Spain, is an acceptable geographical substitute.Admittedly this Spaghetti Western is overrated, overlong and has some slow stretches, not to mention amoral & one-dimensional characters and a story that idolizes lucre above everything; it also has campy and goofy elements, which kills any realism. But, if you can handle all that, Eastwood is the coolest Westerner, Lee Van Cleef is the ultimate bad axx, the exceptional score by Ennio Morricone is iconic and the film pulsates with hip style (for 1966, that is). In short, there's some good in this movie, even greatness, which explains the ridiculous gushing of some reviewers; but, let's be honest, there's also some bad and ugly.Director Leone strained to explain the theme: ""We all have some bad in us, some ugliness, some good. And there are people who appear to be ugly, but when we get to know them better, we realize that they are more worthy."" One reviewer took this and claimed that each of the three protagonists embody the three parts of human nature with Tuco representing the id (i.e. the ""flesh"") and Blondie representing the ego (i.e. the mind with its power of volition). Okay, that fits. But then he tried to argue that Angel Eyes (Van Cleef) represents the superego, which goes to show that he didn't understand this structural model of the psyche seeing as how the superego is the idealistic, heroic side of human nature (aka the ""spirit"") and Angel Eyes in the movie is anything BUT.The film runs 163 minutes (the version I viewed) and was shot in Burgos, Granada, Almería & Colmenar Viejo, Spain, with interiors done in Rome. The screenplay was written by Leone & Luciano Vincenzoni with the additions of Agenore Incrocci & Furio Scarpelli.GRADE: B-","

Now that I got all that out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed, ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly."" Was this the consummate 'spaghetti western?' Hell – I don't know, and I really don't give a rat's rear. There were so many of these flicks made and they all had some sort of redeeming quality (usually lots of gun-play.) This movie is the last of the ""Dollars Trilogy"", directed by Sergio Leone (at least that is what ""Wikipedia"" is telling me). I really can't remember what the movie was about - I just know I enjoyed it. Oh I guess I should try and remember what the plot of this film actually was. Hmmmm, let me see, I think the story was about bad guys shooting at the good guys, good guys shooting at the bad guysBUT no one ever shot at Clint. If you did, he would chew on his cigar a little, and then blow you away. Mr. Eastwood could hit anything with his six-gun. Six-gun? What a misnomer – he never had to reload. He always shot the straightest and fastest. No one stood a chance. And that is about it. That is pretty much the plot and the story of, ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly."" You know what - I actually spoiled it for every spaghetti western starring Clint. They were all very similar. They are all fun to watch and well worth a second and third look as well.","

Though long, it is never overlong, being an amazingly involving story of three ruthless yet disparate men. Performances are perfect, script filled with funny & memorable lines, and climax in the cemetery, both the 'Ecstasy Of Gold' & ' Final Showdown' the perfect cinematic experience, so memorably does it combine character, story, direction, and score.My favorite film of all time, which stands up to repeated viewings.

"jboothmillard","15 November 2005","I had not seen the ""Spaghetti"" Western Trilogy, directed by Sergio Leone (A Fistful of Dollars, Once Upon a Time in the West, Once Upon a Time in America), for many years, and it made perfect sense to watch them again during the 90th birthday of the leading star. Basically, set during the American Civil War, a trio of bounty hunters attempt to kill fugitive Mexican bandit Tuco Ramírez, ""the Ugly"" (Eli Wallach). Tuco shoots the three bounty hunters and escapes on horseback. Elsewhere, mercenary Angel Eyes, ""the Bad"" (Lee Van Cleef) interrogates former Confederate soldier Stevens (Antonio Casas), to find out about the new name of Jackson, a fugitive who has stolen and hidden bags of gold. Steven tells Angel Eyes that Jackson is using the new name Bill Carson. Stevens offers the bounty hunter $1,000 to kill Baker (Livio Lorenzon), his employer. Angel Eyes takes the money, but kills Stevens, fulfilling his contract. He then returns to Baker, collects his fee for killing Stevens, and then, shoots Baker. Meanwhile, Tuco is rescued from three bounty hunters by a drifter, a ""Man with No Name"" to whom Tuco refers as ""Blondie"" (Clint Eastwood), who takes him to the local Sheriff (John Bartha) to collect his $2,000 bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie sets Tuco fre, shooting the noose. The two escape on horseback and split the bounty in a lucrative money-making scheme. They repeat the process in another town for more reward money. Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints and abandons him without horse or water in the desert. Tuco manages to walk to a village, and tracks Blondie down. He plans to force him to hang himself before Union forces distract him, and Blondie is able to escape. Tuco manages to recapture Blondie and forces to walk across the desert until he collapses from dehydration. As Tuco prepares to shoot him, he sees a runaway carriage. Inside are several dead Confederate soldiers and a near-death Bill Carson (Antonio Casale), who promises Tuco $200,000 in gold, buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. Tuco demands to know the name on the grave, but Carson collapses from thirst before answering. When Tuco returns with water, Carson has died, but Blondie, slumped next to him, reveals that Carson told him the name on the grave before dying. Tuco is now motivated to keep Blondie alive, he gives him water and takes him to a nearby mission to recover. After Blondie's recovery, the two leave in Confederate uniforms from Carson's carriage, but Union soldiers capture them and take them to the prisoner of war camp of Batterville. Tuco answers to the name ""Bill Carson"" during roll call, gaining the attention of Angel Eyes, disguised as a Union sergeant. Angel Eyes tortures Tuco, who reveals the name of the cemetery, but confesses that only Blondie knows the name on the grave. Knowing he will not talk if tortured, Angel Eyes offer Blondie an equal share of the gold and a partnership. Blondie agrees and rides out with Angel Eyes and his gang. Tuco is packed on a train to be executed, but escapes. Blondie, Angel Eyes, and his henchmen arrive in an evacuated town; Tuco eventually makes his way to the same town. Tuco takes a bath, during which he is surprised by one of the earlier three bounty hunters, Elam (Al Mulock), but he manages to shoot him dead. Blondie investigates the gunshots and finds Tuco, they agree to resume their old partnership. The pair kill Angel Eyes's men, but Angel Eyes himself has escaped. Tuco and Blondie travel toward Sad Hill, but their way is blocked by a battle between Union troops and the Confederates. Blondie decides to destroy the bridge to disperse the two armies and allow them access to the cemetery. As they wire the bridge with explosives, Tuco suggests they share information, in case one person dies before he can help the other. Tuco reveals the name of the cemetery, while Blondie says ""Arch Stanton"" is the name on the grave where the gold is buried. After the bridge explodes, the armies disperse. On their way, Blondie finds a dying soldier, but is unable to help him, he takes a poncho following the young man's death. Tuco steals a horse and rides to Sad Hill to claim the gold for himself, but Blondie fires a cannon, causing him to fall, and fires further to intimidate him. Tuco eventually makes it to the cemetery and runs, passing the various graves, to find the named grave marker. He finds the name Arch Stanton and begins digging, and Blondie arrives and encourages him at gunpoint to continue. Moments later, Angel Eyes surprises them both. Blondie opens Stanton's grave, revealing only a skeleton, no gold. Blondie states that he lied and offers to write the real name of the grave on a rock, placing it face-down in the courtyard of the cemetery, challenging Tuco and Angel Eyes to a three-way duel. The trio stare each other down in a Mexican standoff. Everyone draws, and Blondie shoots and kills Angel Eyes, while Tuco discovers that his own gun was unloaded by Blondie the night before. Blondie reveals that the gold is actually in the grave beside Arch Stanton's, marked ""Unknown"". Tuco digs and elated to find the six bags of gold pieces, but Blondie holds him at gunpoint. He orders him into a hangman's noose, standing balanced precariously on top of an unsteady grave marker beneath a tree. Blondie takes half the gold and rides away. As Tuco screams for mercy, Blondie returns into sight. From the distance, Blondie fires a rifle shot at the rope, dropping Tuco, alive but tied up, onto his share of the gold. Tuco curses loudly while Blondie rides off into the horizon. Eastwood as the iconic ""Man with No Name"" is cool, looking steely eyed, smoking cigars, wearing a few different costumes, ending in his iconic poncho, it is said most of his dialogue was cut to make him more mysterious, this third and final film cemented him as an international superstar. The film does have lip-sync and dubbing issues, it is admittedly long, but for Eastwood, the likeable Wallach, the Civil War battle sequence, the violence, the final showdown, and the memorable score by Ennio Morricone, this is a fantastic classic western. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!","

"Bob-45","28 November 1999","During his 25 years as a director, Sergio Leone directed only eleven films.  Remarkably, eight rate a 7.0 or better among IMDB members, and five are the on the IMDB Top 250 film all time best list!  GB&U is the highest rated of Leone films by IMDB subscribers.  GB&U is also the final segment of the most successful western trilogy ever made, the ""man with no name"" series; though GB&U is a prequel to the first film, A FISTFULL OF DOLLARS.  Narratively, I've always felt GB&U is the weakest of the series.  However, now that I have seen the DVD version with the excised scenes, I believe it is the strongest.  Two scenes in particular tie the film together.  The first, and most crucial, is a scene where Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) visits a battle-damaged Confederate fort and is told the best place to find ""Bill Carson"" (if he is alive) is in the Union P.O.W. camp. So Angel Eyes appearance later in the film at the camp as the chief jailer makes sense.  The second excised scene shows Tuco (Eli Wallach) taking the horribly dehydrated Blondie (Clint Eastwood) to the nearest confederate camp, and finding out the mission where his brother lives is nearby.  Now, Tuco's assuming the identity of ""Bill Carson"" makes much more sense.I can still quibble with some other shortcomings of the film. Lee Van Cleef did such a terrific job as a the heroic Colonel Mortimer in the previous film in the trilogy, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, it is almost impossible to accept him here as the cold- blooded killer Angel Eyes (Could the name be referring to the ""Angel of Death?"" The narrative never explains.)  Second, though Eastwood's hair is blonde in highlights, the name ""Blondie"" seems rather arbitrary and, again, jarring.  Still, these are minor quibbles about a film and a series that transformed westerns completely.  The influence of the ""Man With No Name"" series can be found in virtually every great western made since.Though the narrative is, on the surface, about three incredibly ruthless men pursuing $200,000 across a landscape of the Civil War, GB&U's underlying agenda is ""anti-war"", particularly the Vietnam War.  The film makes these points effectively without being offensively preachy.Critics of the time criticized the film for ""putting a desert in the middle of the South.""  What a crock!  Although not in thecenter of the War Between the States, quite a bit of action took place in New Mexico and Texas, and the film's writers even got the generals' names right!This is the handsomest of all of Leone's films, and that's saying a lot. The art direction and set decoration are particularly impressive, down to the mortars, gatling guns and naval-style artillary of the time.  Amazingly, CLEOPATRA, made four years before, cost almost 30 times as much! Never before or since have I seen so much of the budget up there on the screen.If you plan to see this film, make sure you watch it on a DVD with additional scenes.  You will need to turn on the English subtitles, since the cheap distributors didn't bother to hire ""sound-alikes"" to dub these ""fill-in"" scenes.  Hopefully, CRITERION will one day release a restored version of this films with the additional scenes inserted in the film where they belong.  After seeing the additional scenes, I raised my rating of the film from a ""7"" to a ""9"".  THAT'S how important they are.","

"claytonators","9 September 2007","When i first saw this film i thought it was slow and pointless. It really didn't seem to be going anywhere at all and worst of all, the story didn't make any sense. A few months later i watched, A Fistful Of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More and i decided to give this a chance again, realising that it was part of the Dollars Trilogy. After watching it a second time all i can say is this ... Sergio Leonios Best, Clint Eastwoods best and the best Western of all time. The battle sense's were by far the best and most life like battle sense's i have ever seen , the best thing about this film is the music, that theme composed greatly by Ennio Morrocone has become a modern classic. The Story really came to me this time watching it. Clint Eastwood plays Blondie (THE GOOD), Eli Wallach plays Tuco (THE BAD) and Lee Van Cleff plays Angle Eyes (THE UGLY), three men who are after a fortune in gold. It sounds like a typical story, but to get to the gold they have to go through the civil war. Well, only Blondie and Tuco have too. Angle Eyes is a general in the war. I really don't know what made think this was crap the first time i watched it. I guess it was because at that time, i really didn't like Westerns at all. But now watching it a second time, it has become one of my top 5 favourite films of all time. One thing i'm happy to see is this is in the top 10 on the IMDb Top 250. It deserves it. 10/10.

Searching the shops for them i found that they came in a box set with a third film, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. I hadn't seen THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY at the time but I liked the first two so I thought that I would buy the whole box set, as that was all that was available at the time. What I didn't realise until after I watched all three was how great THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was and I thought that the first two were good. it turned out that THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was the best of the three. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was probably the only film I had ever bought on DVD without having seen it before and I'm SO glad I did. This film is excellent and although i have seen it many times it still stands up well after multiple viewings. it may be nearly three hours long but it is never boring. all the elements work so well (music, acting, dialogue, setting etc...) i can't really find fault in it. i liked it so much i bought the special edition DVD just to see the extra footage incorporated into the film. if you've not seen this, then rent it because i guarantee you'll soon be buying it shortly afterwards","

"johnmschofield","8 August 2009","This is one those films that most people could watch today and it wouldn't matter that it was made over forty years ago. For me it is almost three hours of excellent entertainment. I watch it every now and then but not obsessively. It is like an old reliable friend who comes round and is completely welcome. You know how pleasurable it is going to be while the friend is around and you enjoy the company immensely. You can watch this film twenty times and still notice something which you had missed previously. I enjoy this film for how it is I am not concerned or irritated by the historical errors or any other errors which may have been made. It is just so atmospheric you can almost feel the emotions on screen. In order to appreciate it more maybe you should watch the other two films first 'a fistful of dollars' and 'a few dollars more' but only because they were made in that order. There is violence in the film but the mere fact that the action is set during the American Civil War period is enough of a guide as to the content. In conclusion it is visual treat and is one of the best films ever made. Please watch it and enjoy the experience.","

"muchachostar","15 May 2021","I cant believe the quality of performance I just watched. This is incredible, every character plays such an important rol and its so well acted, you simply cant even choose who did it better but in my opinion Tuco's performance was captivating and Eastwood's is simply iconic. Even 45 years later, I was able to watch this movie and enjoy every part of it. If you havent watched it for whatever reason, stop wasting your time.","

"SebMoz","28 October 2020","Where do I even begin talking about this movie? This is the movie that made me interested in movies in the first place, and to this day I've not been able to find a movie that resonnates better with me. I'm astonished how well this movie holds up, even after 50 years, and it's almost a bit depressing when you think about how unappreciated it was at the time of its release. Fortunately, it has since then gained more recognition, and is widely regared as one of the greatest movies ever made, and in my opinion, the single best movie ever made.From the opening credits you know you're about to watch something special. The iconic theme combined with the visuals that tell their own tale make for arguably one of the most entertaining opening credits. Then, we're immediately thrown into the action, as three bounty hunters try to hunt down Tuco, The Ugly, after a tense scene where they walk towards each other, leading you to believe that a duel between them is about to commence.. Speaking of which, Tucos introduction is practically perfect. In just one shot, we know almost everything there is to know about the character, by looking at his expression and the things he carries in his hands. Angel Eyes's (The Bad) and Blondie's (The Good) introductions are also incredibly good, quickly establishing the nature of the characters and how we will come to view them throughout the movie.One of the things one must keep in mind when watching this movie, is that Sergio Leone prioritizes the individual scene instead of an intricately crafted story. What this results in is that EVERY SINGLE SCENE is a work of art, complete with suspense, it's own pacing and most important of all: the gorgeous cinematography that defines this movie. This means that every scene in this movie is iconic in some way, and it is in my opinion the movie's greatest strength.The characters in this movie are very cleverly constructed in my opinion, and while I can understand people complaining about some being bland, I think they work perfectly for this movie. Blondies backstory is left ambigous, though one can't help but wonder what other adventures he has been on. He isn't very outspoken, and this gives him that iconic feeling of mysteriousness. Tuco IS given a rich backstory, expressed both in his conversation with his brother and his hanging scene at the beginning, where the sheriff lists up everything he has done. He's by far the most entertaining character in the movie, constantly talking and goofing around. Then there's Angel Eyes, which similar to Blondie doesn't have a backstory, but his tenacity and charisma as the ultimate villain more than makes up for it. The side characters are also generally very good, even though they rarely get more than one scene.The themes of this movie generally revolves around morality and greed, and I love how it's not shoved in your face with unnecessary dialogue, but rather subtly shown through how the characters approach different situations. I also like how the three main characters are very similar in the beginning, but start to show their differences once they experience more and more of the Civil War and its cruelties. Angel Eyes, being truly evil, uses it for profit and to satisfy his need for violence and money. Tuco's approach is similar , but he doesn't have the charisma needed to benefit of the war, and so chooses a more pacifistic way of dealing with it. The difference is clearest with blondie, who start the movie as an immoral bounty hunter, but through seeing the cruel reality of the war he becomes a more merciful man, which culminates in how he spares Tuco's life at the very end, despite everything Tuco did to him.If there has ever been a movie in which the director and composer has worked together in perfect harmony, this is it. As opposed to regular movies, Leone and Morricone sat down before filming to create the themes, before adjusting the actual shots to the music. This is in my opinion the movie where Morricone transformed into a composer god. Every theme is perfect, from the iconic main theme, to The Story of a Soldier, to The Ecstasy of Gold and The Trio. The music and action blends together perfectly to the point that the movie becomes an entirely different one without the score.It's time to talk about the finale, the climax, the peak of tension. The entire movie has been building up to this: Tuco arrives at the cementary, and for 4 minutes the only thing happening is him looking for the grave he believes the 200.000 dollars in gold is buried. This scene is carried entirely by the score, the iconic Ecstasy of Gold theme. Then Blondie and Angel Eyes show up to the cementary. As it's revealed that Tuco's information about the spesific grave is false, they realize that only Blondie knows which grave it's buried in, and so begins the single best climactic showoff in ANY movie. Three men, all exceptionally skilled with their guns, stands in a circle, and for 5 minutes the only thing moving is the score, Morricone's The Trio, which builds suspense as it rises in power and greatness. There is no dialogue, yet the facial expressions and the editing still tells a compelling story in which the characters all try to figure out who will shoot first. As the music suddenly stops, Angel Eyes draws, only for Blondie to shoot him first, but only to injure. As Angel Eyes attempts to shoot Blondie again, he is shot and killed, and so ends the story of The Bad. Tuco and Blondie then digs up the gold, and we get a final showcase of Blondie's character arc: after ordering Tuco to put his head in a noose and riding off, he reappears and severs the rope, leaving Tuco alive. Then he rides away, The Good, The Man with no Name, to the iconic theme that introduced the movie in the first place.","

"laura-69549","24 February 2021","This film has everything a moviegoer would want, stunning cinematography, a stunning and powerful music score and a scene stealing performance from the legend Eli Wallach as Tuco.Considered one of the best films of all time by many, the good, the bad and the ugly stands the test of time as a hilarious, witty, edgy and exciting classic that will go down in history as a masterpiece.",NA
"tuggerwaugh","24 February 2019","I don't really like westerns but was happy to ignore that based on Eastwood's amazing catalogue and its high rating across viewers and critics.It misses the mark for me. Treasure hunts are cliched plots and the sound editing aspects of this movie are horrendous. Probably the worst I've seen in any film, let alone any hugely popular movie.The visuals have obviously paved the way for future films.The characters are OK but nothing we haven't seen before. The music is great and suspense is phenomenal.People seem to get carried away with how good this movie is because of a sound loop and standoff climax but somehow forget how slow everything else is. The runtime is crazy.It may be the best of its genre but its genre is pretty low on the list of movie achievements. I feel like we've all grown up a bit. I would understand rave reviews at the time it was released but has it stood up to them after all these years? I don't think it has. It's no Casablanca, Citizen Kane or Deer Hunter.Again, I don't like westerns so have come to this already a little prejudiced.",NA
"paddynair-1","12 February 2007","A pure western.Will always be remembered for its great music and the personality of Clint Eastwood.In fact this was the film in which Clint Eastwood made his name.Both Lee Van Cleef & Eli Wallach put in sterling performances.The direction is exceptional The real merit of this movie is that it brings to light the exact situation in the USA around the period 1864-65 when the confederates were losing the war.There was confusion & chaos all around & no real authority.Hence the proliferation of a number of bandits and outlaws.The photography and direction are breathtaking and there is areal attempt to bring out the characters of those who dominated the period.Life could be extinguished at any moment & a man had to live by his wits and by his guns.Women were fair game to any outlaw.Hanging and capital punishment were routineThis was the real United States of that period and they could practice this culture in isolation,as the communication & technologies of the period were highly limited compared to today.",NA
"Fella_shibby","23 June 2016","The beautiful cinematography by Tonino Delli colli (The name of the rose, Life is beautiful, Once upon a time in the west), the excellent music by legendary Morricone and great camera work make this a stylish masterpiece. It is a landmark film in many respects. It has a wonderful cast of characters. Clint Eastwood is at his best, Lee van Cleef (For a few dollars more, Escape from new york) portrayed perfectly the evil one and Eli Wallach (Magnificent seven, Mackennas gold) steals the show as the Ugly. Director Sergio Leone (Dollars trilogy, Once upon a time in the west) takes his time to tell the story. He uses different types of camera angles, extreme close ups etc. The close ups are amazing. Facial expressions are very key to this movie which has very little dialogue at times. When I saw this first on a VHS as a kid, i was blown away by Ennio morricones score. I lost the count of the number of times I saw this flick. This movie is the grand daddy of all westerns.",NA
"Aomalle27","30 April 2008","A truly magnificent 3 hour long tale of three bandits, on the trail of half a million dollars in stolen confederate gold. Clint Eastwood is Blondie, a mercenary gunman who partners up with the Mexican bandit Tucco (Eli Wallach) to play a con on several different western towns. Tucco plays the part of captured bandit, Blondie the part of bounty hunter who has captured the wanted criminal. Subsequently he collects the reward, and Tucco is to be hung. But being a con, naturally Blondie just shoots Tuccon down off the hangman's rope, and into the sunset they ride to their next con job. Into the fray rides Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef playing the role to menacing perfection), a ruthless killer on the trail of the stolen gold after two of the thieves turn on each other, both hiring Angel Eyes to murder the other. He may be a ruthless killer, but he does have a perverted sense of honor, and thus fulfills both contracts, but not before one of the men tells him the story of the stolen gold, and whom he should seek out to get it, another thief in on the heist, who has now joined up with the Confederate army. As the broad backdrop of the Civil War rages on, we are given a microcosm of the conflict with not two, but three competing sides. What's interesting here is the dichotomy of the characters being almost mirror images of one another. Each a skilled gunman, and proficient killer. However, what separates the three is the degree of morality each has; Blondie killing only when necessary, when he's confronted with no other choice. Tucco kills for convenience, his life of crime has made him many enemies, so he's often faced with the end result, those out for revenge. But Tucco has a softer side, and we see several revelations about his upbringing that place him in a somewhat more heroic light than he first comes across as. Finally, there's Angel Eyes, a demonic killer with no empathy, sympathy or moral direction. He's out to get everything in life for himself, and will sell out anyone that tries to stop him. He delights in torture, but seldom sullies his own hands. He prefers to let others do the dirty work, and enjoys the spoils. I really think he's a representation of the Devil. Someone that enjoys manipulating, killing and causing chaos. A being totally involved with the pleasures of life regardless of the cost to others. The film's climax with a Mexican standoff is priceless, and the entire film is a enjoyable, riveting experience that should be on the beginners list for Western film viewing. Interestingly enough, it is so deep and nuanced, it can easily go onto an Experts list for WEstern viewing as well.",NA

"t-81966-84968","26 March 2020","The film satirizes the bitter war between the north and the south over a meaningless bridge, but it shows three cowboys, or bandits, fighting for treasure in a serious way. Though they were called the good, the bad, and the ugly, their purposes were exactly the same. The good guy didn't kill the ugly guy in the end, but he still managed to get the victory by a cheap trick. Bad men are honest and trustworthy though they kill innocents. And ugly people, though driven by the wind, are driven by the necessity of life.",NA
"Gary-161","14 August 2001","There is an operatic scene in a graveyard towards the end of this film that a lesser director may not have thought of. Though irrelevant, it is a moment of pure exhilarating cinema as Wallach runs around in a dizzy attempt to locate a stone.The problem with Leone's films are their curious lack of suspense and tension. They plod along, then end. The characters ignore the fact that people are dying around them for real issues and values while their own cynical interests extend only to money. This obsession that cinema has with unsavoury and morally worthless people soon becomes wearisome as no amount of inspired camera work and direction can prevent the film being pulled down towards dullness by dull people.",NA
"adamjohns-42575","29 May 2020","Well, there's 3 hours I will never get back! I really didn't see the point to the whole film and was it a western or a war film? It wasn't very good at being either.I thought the soundtrack was great, but maybe that's because I know it so well. But what was up with the vocal track? The lips didn't sync properly for anyone!I have to say that Eli Wallach did a great job in this film and deserved the main credit and a much better script and storyline.My favourite bit was when Clint Eastwood was playing with a kitten. It was the only bit of the long and drawn out film that didn't make me yawn or sigh whilst checking to see how long it was before it would finish.At least I can scratch it off of my bucket list poster now!",NA
"JohnHowardReid","17 December 2016","Director Sergio Leone allows his big budget to dictate to him here. Filmed on a smaller scale and shorne of its irrelevant episodes, this movie most likely would have emerged as a compulsively fascinating and admirably taut western of classic simplicity. As if to compensate for all the film's irrelevancies, Leone often adopts a style of filming in extreme close-ups, but he tends to draw these scenes out too long to sustain suspense. Still, thanks to superb photography by Delli Colli, music by Morricone and an inspired performance by Eli Wallach – added to a plot that is basically interesting – it would have been difficult to go too far wrong.",NA
"Lt_Coffey_182","9 February 2007","By a fair margin, the greatest out of the spaghetti western films, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a cinematic triumph that will always be remembered most of all for the legendary score and stand off scene. What surprised me most of all was that a long film with quite a slow pace to it actually appeared to move quite quickly; this is thanks to Leone's superior direction and the frequent change of locations within the film. Clint Eastwood's iconic status was firmly established in this film as a bad ass desperado with compulsory cigar attached, Blondie makes Dirty Harry appear meagre in comparison! Whilst the characterisation provided by the supporting cast was over the top to an almost comic book standard, their performances and characters were still memorable and enjoyable as they provided a stark contrast to Eastwood's quiet loner.Where a lot of westerns fall short is the plot, they tend to become a victim of style over substance but this film is an exception as it provides us with a fairly intricate plot. The way Tuco's (Wallach) murderous intentions regarding Blondie are quashed by the fact that Blondie knows the secret of the treasure, leading to Tuco fighting to keep him alive rather than kill him, is very commendable. The tie in with the American civil war is very enjoyable and provides some further tension and heightens the predicament that the main characters are in, especially considering Angle Eyes (Cleef) is a high rank in the Unionist regiment that Eastwood and Wallach have infiltrated. The tension is built up fairly well, even though it requires patience. The final stand off, for instance, takes a matter of minutes for the main characters to get in their positions with the camera ranging from extreme close ups to the characters' eyes to shots that appear to be a mile away. Whilst this sounds potentially frustrating, it induces overwhelming anticipation and once again, the music comes in to play, setting up a true piece of cinematic history.Whilst there are no award winning performances on show, the leads are very good. Eastwood played greatly on his tough guy image and manages to tell us a lot about the character despite not saying much. Eastwood illustrates fantastically, a character devoid of trust and sentiment but also a character of great honour. It is plain to see that Blondie is world weary and he knows that it's kill or be killed. Eli Wallach is very good, probably the best performance in the film. His animated performance brings his character to life as a thoroughly dislikeable loudmouth who is too stupid to avoid trouble but greedy enough not to let his desire to kill Blondie stopping him get the treasure. Lee Van Cleef is even more dislikeable because where Wallach's Tuco is untrustworthy, Cleef's Angel Eyes is brutally honest with ruthlessness to match. The interrogation scenes in the Union camp really highlight this nature and makes sure that the audience knows he means business. The best thing about these characters is that they all flawed, it's not all black and white. Even Eastwood's 'The Good' is not all that good.Laced with brilliant set pieces and memorable performances, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is very memorable and definitely a classic. Watching Wallach hunt Eastwood with his cigar stubs proves the film had a sense of humour but that didn't take away the fact that the film depicts a life of brutality where not even women and children are safe when they stand between power hungry men and their goal. Effective story telling mixed with macabre imagery assures this films place in cinema history and possibly even the title of the best western ever made.",NA
"jimbo-53-186511","21 December 2013","Having been hugely impressed with Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America and having enjoyed previous Clint Eastwood westerns, I finally decided to sit down and watch the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. My expectations were high as this film currently has an IMDb rating of 9.0 and is ranked as the 5th best film of all time (according to IMDb). Needless to say, my expectations for this film weren't just met, but they were exceeded.The film basically follows Angel Eyes (Van Cleef) Blondie (Eastwood) and Tuco (Wallach) who are all trying to find some missing coins which are worth $200,000. Initially, it is only Angel Eyes that is aware of the hidden loot, but after Tuco has a chance encounter with an injured and rather thirsty Bill Bryson (who happens to be the man that Angel Eyes is looking for) Bill Bryson informs Tuco that he will tell him where the coins are hidden as long as he gives him water - he tells him which graveyard it is hidden in, but not the name of the gravestone. Desperate to find out which gravestone the coins are hidden in, Tuco obliges and runs to get water. However, in the few minutes that he is gone Bryson dies and tells a worn out Blondie the name of the gravestone where the loot is hidden. Reluctantly, Tuco decides to nurse Blondie back to health so that he can take him to the gravestone where the loot is hidden. Tuco had been punishing Blondie due to the fact that Blondie double crossed him earlier.There are so may things to praise this film about; firstly we have that fantastic Ennio Morricone score - I loved his music in Once Upon a Time in America and was equally impressed with the score in this film. Who can also forget the iconic signature tune which is played in the opening credits and several times throughout this film? Just brilliant.Then we come to the acting, Van Cleef, Eastwood and Wallach were all fantastic - check out the scene between Van Cleef and the guy that he intimidates at the start of the film. There is no dialogue between the men for a number of minutes as the 2 men just fix each other with icy stares- sometimes the best way to create atmosphere and tension is to use the 'less is more' approach and that perfectly sums up the first 10-15 minutes of this film. Eastwood was also fantastic and I feel that he is at his best when he plays the 'tough gunslinger'. He's a great actor and I feel that nobody combines grit and coolness quite like Clint. Wallach was also fantastic in the role of a fairly dumb outlaw. I thought he was convincing in this role and thought he was a really funny character.For me, the biggest strength of this film lies with Eastwood and Wallach and for the most part it is them that this film belongs to. The continual point scoring and 'one oneupmanship' between the 2 men was hilarious to watch. They both share great on screen chemistry and that for me is one of the main reasons that TGTBATU works so well. Another strength is in the story telling. You are constantly left guessing throughout the film and as a viewer you are never quite sure what is going to happen next which certainly made sure the film held my interest throughout. Although this film is quite long it never felt drawn out and pretty much every scene was relevant in advancing the plot. The film culminates in a rather tense finale which proved to be a great ending to a great film.TGTBATU is an absolute classic and is a film that I would recommend to everyone.",NA

"ruffinelli_ro","28 March 2009","I only hear good things about The Good, The Bad & The Ugly. But I think that those things are not enough. This movie only gets better each time you watch it. It has an excellent plot, well crafted characters and all the other details that makes this movie so incredible.It might not be the most accurate motion picture regarding that period of time, but its essence is not based on that. The other elements make this film one of the greatest movie of all times and definitely must watch before you die.I can't believe that some people rated this film with only one star since this film deserves at least 7 (only if you hated the movie) but in the end it is all a matter of subjectivity.They don't make films like this anymore..",NA
"jerome_horwitz","2 June 2005","The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, stars Clint Eastwood as Blondie, Eli Wallach as Tuco, and Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes.This movie is a masterpiece, and represents the qualities that good movies should exhibit. It's written with an interesting story, great character development, great character interaction, and great production values.This movie is about 3 gunslingers who at times work together, or against each other in search of a bountiful treasure hidden in a secluded cemetery. At different points of the movie, Blondie and Tuco work together, then betray each other, then come to work together again. At other points of the movie, Angel Eyes works together with Blondie, leaving Tuco as the out man.The story begins before Tuco and Blondie meet up. After meeting, they then work together to collect bounties on Tuco who is worth $1000s. The team can split the bounties as they move territory to territory scamming the law. With each new town, Blondie collects the bounty, then saves Tuco from actually being put to death, then they divide up the bounty.Problems begin as greed sets in. With in a short time, Blondie abandons Tuco after rescuing him, even after Tuco warned him to never betray him and leave him alive. Eventually, the roles are reversed, and it is Tuco who abuses Blondie and nearly causes his death.But this is where the story takes a major twist, as a run away wagon with a nearly dead passenger reveals secrets of a treasure, but each Tuco and the half dead Blondie only learn a vital part of the secret from. So now Tuco must save Blondie to get to the treasure.The story continues from there, and we get to learn quite a bit about the characters. Especially Tuco, in my opinion Leone purposely allowed us to see that indeed there were no defined roles as who was ""the good"", ""the bad"", and ""the ugly"". Greed is very powerful, especially when life is such a struggle to begin with.The final showdown is unbelievable. It is epic, and is absolutely worth anything to see. It's the pinnacle of movie making, the showdown, the movie, the characters, the drama building. Truly a masterpiece.This movie is great, it's a cinematic masterpiece. As of this writing, it's #16 in the top 250 movies on IMDb, and deserves to be. Any western fan must see this movie, no excuses. Any fan of movies in general must see this movie, no excuses.Thank you Sergio for making this movie.10/10",NA
