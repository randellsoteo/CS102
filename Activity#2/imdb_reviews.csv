"planktonrules","16 January 2015","I usually don't watch action films. They just aren't my sort of thing. However, my daughter insisted that I watch ""Pacific Rim"" and I was feeling absolutely horrible when I watched the film, as I had just gone through some painful surgery that morning. So, to take my mind off my aches, I gave it a try. And, thankfully, it turned out to be exactly the sort of tonic I needed--entertaining and crazy fun. While I didn't see it in the theater (the best way to see this type of movie), I did see it on a very large screen at home and watching it on a small screen is practically a waste of time. For once, I loved that a film has eye- popping visuals, explosions and action--and it manages to deliver an entertaining experience without leaving you feeling dumb for having enjoyed it--a problem too often associated with movie of this style. Well worth your time.","

"Darkside-Reviewer","22 July 2020","Pacific Rim really surprised me when it was first released in 2013. My initial thought was that this was just gunna end up being another movie about Colossal sized monsters similar to Cloverfield or Godzilla only with a Hollywood big budget and while it shares some similarities to Godzilla it does stand out on it's own with it's unique monsters and awsome robots plus with the movie being directed by Guillermo del Toro it has a unique style to it that only Guillermo del Toro can bring to a movie.Pacific Rims story isn't a particularly complicated one but it's certainly got some interesting ideas. When the world is invaded by Colossal sized creatures known as Kaijus mankind bands together creating a defence against the Kaiju in the form of Colossal sized battle robots known as Jaegers each unique in style and armed to the teeth which are each piloted by two pilots who control the robot via neural interfaces the only problem is both pilots must be drift compatible meaning they have to be to link minds and create a stable neural link to be able to control the Jaeger during this both pilots share each other's memorys, feelings and thoughts. The Kaiju begin appearing faster than Jaegers can be assembled so with time running out before there are more Kaijus than Jaegers to fight them the last few remaining pilots prepare for a final assault on the portal the Kaijus are coming from.The movie is like a mix between Godzilla and Power Rangers only a lot more adult and with much better effects. The Jaeger robots look amazing especially when fighting against the Kaiju monsters. There's plenty of cool action scenes which show the Kaiju monsters being shot, blown up, punched by robot rocket fists and even decapitations.The characters are likable and interesting my favourite characters personally are the two mad scientists who dissect and study the Kaijus while they are meant to be the kind of comic relief of the movie they are very funny and likable both arguing over scientific theories and trying to prove each over wrong.I highly recommend watching this movie if your a fan of movies that feature Colossal sized monsters crashing through city's while fighting with Colosal sized robots with swords, guns and rocket fists. This isn't a movie intended for kids in case your wondering this movie is definitely for a more mature audience even though the synopsis for the movie sounds like it was made for kids who watch Transformers cartoons.","

"alr126","27 November 2013","While watching this movie, I was reminded of a couple of films and TV shows from my youth, first was any of the original Godzilla films, the second, a TV show Ultra Man. The FX were way better here, but, it just made me think of them. I found the film entertaining, no Oscar winner, but, it was good. Some parts kept you on the edge of your seat, of course, rooting for the good guys.I also had to think that mankind would have or could have thought of a better defense/offense weapon than giant robots. To bring a fight into the city would have cost trillions of dollars, perhaps Quadrillions of dollars. Okay, I'm reading way to much into it. Watch the movie, you will enjoy it.","

"damianphelps","28 February 2021","Sometimes when I sit down and watch a movie I just want to be swept away and be dazzled with both sight and sound. The movies don't have to be dramatically perfect just capable of blowing all my sensors.Battleship and Pacific Rim are 2 of those movies.Pacific Rim takes a cool concept for a story, Monsters vs Machines and entwines a human element (the pilots) to result in a really fun extravaganza. The movie is not deep but has enough story to piece together the fighting sequences.Sit down, hit the lights, pump the volume, disengage brain and have a blast :)","

"Leofwine_draca","29 July 2014","PACIFIC RIM is Guillermo del Toro's tribute to the kaiju and Japanese sci-fi movies of his youth; you know, the ones involving giant monsters trashing cities and huge robots sent out to protect mankind. I had an inkling he wanted to make this movie after the giant plant creature in HELLBOY 2; well, now he has.And this is a lot of fun, a decent popcorn flick for a change and a film that's well made enough to erase memories of the disappointing TRANSFORMERS movies. It's a great Hollywood tribute to Japanese cinema, filled with all of the wonderful effects and super-sized action that you'd hope for. Del Toro is one of those directors who hasn't made a bad film yet; you can always rely on him for entertainment.Sure, the stuff with the human characters isn't as interesting as the giant stuff. But at least we get plenty of British actors in the cast (Burn Gorman, Idris Elba, Rob Kazinsky, Charlie Hunnam) which keeps it fresh and interesting. The CGI effects are excellent, as you'd expect, and while the storyline is very predictable, that's not the point. The point is to deliver huge bouts of destructive action, and that's what del Toro does. And it's a lot of fun.","

"drummer303","10 November 2013","To all the reviewers who gave this movie low ratings, I can only say this; What did you expect to see? Did you watch this expecting to see something deep and meaningful? The trailers and posters make it perfectly clear what kind of movie this is going to be. Heavy CGI, regular Hollywood 'save the planet' storyline re-run. Young eye candy super hot actors. You know the score. If you want to see something clever, this is not it and it was never going to be.Question is, does it do the job it sets out to do? I think it does rather well, yeah OK, it's cheesy as hell and you know how it's going to end before it starts, ( the world will be saved right? ) considering it's being told in retrospect the clue to the inevitable ending is there in the first 10 seconds of the movie.I liked the mind meld idea of the 2 pilots, and I thought they covered most bases explaining the technology behind the enormous robots (Jaegers) pretty well. It does have a few technical plot holes here and there, but the film does have a 'let's just get on with it' kind of feel. The alien creatures (Kaiju) are great and the robot v monster battles are superb. Towards the end the pace picks right up and the story starts to fall apart a bit, but by that point who cares? In general Pacific Rim is a fast paced, slick looking piece of techno-action that most Sci-Fi fans will enjoy. It's big, loud, dumb and very pretty, largely due to Guillermo Del Toro being at the helm.It's Sunday afternoon on the sofa material I think. I know these kind of films are 'designed' for the big screen, but honestly I prefer them at home most of the time. Unless of course, you like feeling as though you are sitting the middle of a continuous explosion for and hour and half.","

"thekarmicnomad","24 November 2013","This film starts of with a monologue that explains in twenty seconds how big monsters start appearing from the sea and destroying everything. The only defence against them is to kick their heads in with massive robots. Cool! Starting so quickly out the blocks I expected this to be a fast paced action movie.It really isn't. About every film element ever used, runs its course before the inevitable big battle. You get a fall from grace, a rivalry, a training period, a love story, forgiveness, reconciliation, etc. etc.The battle sequences are epic, the monsters and robots are amazing, Kids especially will love them, and the action goes on and on.The dialogue is cheesier and hammier than a 60 foot pizza monsters, and coupled with the extended scope of this film can make watching it gruelling if you are not instantly gripped.This will keep any kids gripped for hours (nearly three of them) but if sci-fi isn't your thing get comfy and bring a pillow.","

"JPfanatic93","23 September 2013","Guillermo Del Toro's epic homage to the Japanese 'KaiÄµu' movies, produced on a bigger budget than all such giant monster movies of the last fifty years combined. Del Toro obviously has a great love and respect for the genre, resulting in a very catchy action flick, undoubtedly the best American counterpart to its Japanese predecessors. One might almost say Hollywood has redeemed itself for the 1998 version of Godzilla, but such a statement had better be held back for another year, until the next American reboot of Godzilla hits theatres in 2014. In the meantime, Pacific Rim works well as an appetizer to the big G's resurrection. An extra-dimensional rift opens on the bottom of the Pacific and huge beasts come pouring out, wreaking havoc on mankind as they lay waste to cities and obliterate our armed forces. Humanity quickly sets aside its internal differences and joins forces in creating big robots to fight the creatures on their own terms. Piloted by a pair of human Avatars, these so-called 'JaÃ«gers' effectively combat the beasts, but the life of a JaÃ«ger pilot as Del Toro reveals is filled with personal loss. When the monsters emerge ever more rapidly from the Breach, as it is named, JaÃ«ger command develops an intricate and dangerous plan to halt the KaiÄµu threat once and for all. Del Toro briefly explores the history of the first KaiÄµu assaults and the development of their robotic antagonists and afterwards spends more time getting us invested in the human characters than is usual for this type of film. It does make the movie feel like its dragging its feet for a while, until he unleashes the action the audience craves with a vengeance, resulting in over an hour of nigh endless monster bashing. Unfortunately he cannot help but inserting a few characters that are supposed to deliver some much needed comic relief to make sure we don't take it all too seriously, but sadly these characters â stereotypical geeky scientists as ever we've seen them â are so mind-boggingly annoying (Charlie Day particularly) they make you wish for a KaiÄµu to step on them to end their endless whining. Del Toro's talents are better suited in delving deeper into a world where KaiÄµus are not only a threat to world peace but also big business: toy companies produce action figures of them, creepy cults worship them and in Hong Kong, a 'Bone Town' is established, a black market for KaiÄµu products for shady purposes, similar to the disgusting existing South-East Asian trade in animal parts. Run by Ron Perlman (always a joy when paired with Del Toro), some of the funniest, wittiest and anatomically most unsettling scenes take place here. Though the dealings and the history of the JaÃ«gers are fleshed out to the fullest, their enormous alien adversaries, ever the most important ingredient in a KaiÄµu film, do remain somewhat underexposed by comparison. Unfortunately their motivations â they're really foot soldiers out to cause as much damage to mankind as possible, in order to pave the way for an invasion from their (smaller) intelligent overlords â remind us of the recent Shyamalan flop After Earth, a movie we'd rather forget entirely. Usually, KaiÄµu are more antiheroes than full-out villains, but Del Toro opts to keep them a simple threat to be wiped out instead of imbuing them with a more sympathetic character like their forebears Gojira, Gorgo and Rodan, who were always the victim of human (nuclear) folly, transforming them into avenging gods to remind us of our place in the world. The movie is dedicated to Ray Harryhausen and Ishiro Honda, two people who only too well understood the need to layer their creatures and make them charm you so you feel more for them, but in this instance, Del Toro decided not to go with such wisdom. As a result, Pacific Rim at best is a highly likable action flick, but not necessarily an apt lesson for western audiences into the true nature of the KaiÄµu genre. Then again, there's only so much you can do with the notion of giant robots bashing giant monsters. Let's say Guillermo gets as much out of that premise as we could hope for.","

"bob the moo","3 November 2013","Part of the reason I have started completely sitting out the summer blockbuster season is that I just got fed up going to crowded noisy cinemas to be disappointed by films that promised much but deliver just basic effects and little else. With Pacific Rim though, it is hard to feel this way because it is a film that has never pretended to be anything other than a Japanese inspired monster movie where big robots hit big aliens in a way that pretty much never makes much sense when you think about it. The plot is explained very quickly at the start of the film and we then jump into the future where the war we just learned about is reaching a peak. From here we have some doubt, some lessons to learn, barriers to overcome but really what we have are big special effects punching each other. And it works.It is easy to wring one's hands and say that blockbusters are the death of film, but all things have a place as long as they are done well and this is at least an honest and fun film. I say honest because it has no pretension to it â it is plain and simple a monster movie with a very big budget behind it. The effects are good, with good monster design and generally a sense of fun and energy to the deliver. Of course it is just effects hitting other effects but it works for what it is and at least does this well â unlike other films that would aspire to more but yet can't even do this with any skill. The action sequences are large and fun throughout and the soapy drama doesn't get in the way at all. The film is loaded with references which I mostly got â the voice of GLaDOS being my favorite one.The cast are not particularly famous but it doesn't matter since the effects are the stars here. That said I thought they did a good job, in particular I enjoyed seeing Elba, Day, Collins, Kikuchi and others in their various roles. Del Toro continues his love of all things geeky with this film and in terms of direction it looks good, with plenty going on but never not being clear and engaging.It isn't a brilliant film by any means but it is a straightforward one that is honest with the viewer. Robots punching monsters â that is all that is promised and on that it very much delivers. If this sounds like your thing then this will hit the spot no problem.","

"moviexclusive","10 July 2013","As far as summer blockbusters go, 'Pacific Rim' has probably the most unabashedly uncomplicated premise - giant robots versus giant monsters. How much you enjoy Guillermo del Toro's robot-monster smackdown ultimately depends on whether you expect the movie to be any more than that. If you did, then you're probably going to walk away disappointed at how simplistic this apocalyptic spectacle will turn out to be; but if you're satisfied simply with watching huge-ass monsters and robots go up against each other, then you will enjoy every bit of this epic (and yes we do mean it literally).Indeed, the draw of del Toro's monster of a movie has always been to witness the monumental series of battles between massive lizard-like monsters (referred to in the movie by the Japanese word 'Kaiju' as a tribute to the science fiction films from the country which featured such giant beasts, e.g. Godzilla) and 25-story high robots (known as Jaegers, or 'hunters' in German) operated by humans. And in this regard, let us assure you that nothing in your expectation will prepare you for what del Toro has managed to accomplish on screen - not even comparing it to a 'Godzilla' meets 'Transformers' movie does it any justice.Let's start with the basics. First and foremost, the action is shot cleanly, meaning none of them shaky-cams nor extreme close-ups that diminish the scale on which it is unfolding. It is also coherent - thanks to some impressive work from del Toro regular Guillermo Navarro as cinematographer and John Gilroy and Peter Amundson as editors - rather than just a mashup of scenes that don't flow well into one another. We'll add one more before we start gushing - it is also beautifully choreographed, with just the right mix of medium and wide shots to place you right into the heart of the action.If that description above seems too clinical, then how about this - these setpieces are superb; in fact, they are worthy of every superlative that you can think of. Working on a gargantuan scale, del Toro executes the action with magnificence, whether the fleeting shots of the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge at the beginning or the more detailed sequences in the middle and at the end - in particular, a simply jaw-dropping one begins at sea just off the waters of Hong Kong and then continues seamlessly inland where both the port and the very city centre gets decimated by two Jaegers battling two Category 4 Kaijus.It isn't just about how colossal it gets; it is also the sheer mesmerising quality of the images, starting from the amazing level of detail of the Jaegers and the Kaijus. Even though it seems to be raining a little too conveniently every time one of these battles happens out at sea, there's no denying just how real and majestic each of them feels. On the other hand, the cityscapes are arresting in their neon hues, and the combination of the futuristic look with which del Toro paints these familiar cities with the bioluminescent appendages and venom of the Kaijus make for a particularly appealing visual palette.Now that we've finished with the savoury bits, it is only fair that we get to the (ahem) less than wieldy parts, which is in actual fact just about everything else we have yet to talk about. At first, the science- fiction mythology sounds rather intriguing - instead of coming from the skies, the threat to our planet came from a rift deep within the Pacific Ocean, a portal through which the Kaijus emerged and necessitated an equally massive response in the form of the Jaegers. Ditto the functioning of the Jaegers, which given their size, have to be operated by two pilots who sync up their minds via the neural handshake, otherwise known as the ""drift"".But del Toro and his fellow screenwriter Travis Beacham (who is also credited with this original story) uses these elements too mechanically. The rift is no more than an excuse for an underwater climax where the Jaegers aim to close the portal from which the Kaijus emerged, a resolution not quite different from that in 'The Avengers'. More significantly, the melding of minds isn't quite exploited for enough dramatic possibility, particularly given its significance in enabling our two lead pilots, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) to bond so seamlessly with each other.Equally clunky is the characterisation, which has as much poignancy as a piece of metal. Raleigh's scarred Jaeger pilot, still reeling at first from the death of his brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff), heals too quickly for us to make much of an emotional connection. Mori's own traumatic near-death experience as a child that continues to haunt her also rings hollow and is equally quickly forgotten. Idris Elba plays his Jaeger commander Stacker Pentecost in suitably macho fashion, but is largely one-note and engineered simply to deliver the rallying cries at suitable intervals - like the oft-heard ""Today, we are cancelling the apocalypse"" in the trailers.No thanks to the plotting and character issues, the pacing of the movie sags considerably after a prolonged prologue establishing the necessary backstory of the robots-versus-monsters war and Raleigh's own past. It only picks up at the halfway mark when the deep-sea monsters finally clash again with their mechanical counterparts, which will either be stimulating enough (if you're an adolescent fanboy) to make you wet your pants or leave you numb. Our opinion? It is del Toro's most ambitious, most imaginative and probably most groundbreaking movie ever, but we wish there were more of the warmth and character that have defined some of his best work.","

"ersinkdotcom","17 July 2013","""Pacific Rim"" is going to be a hit with fanboys all over the planet. It's the type of movie that they feel obligated to love because of what it's about and who made it. In this case we have a movie about alien dinosaurs (Kaijus) fighting giant robots (Jaegers) directed by Guillermo del Toro (filmmaker who most Comi-Con attendees think can do no wrong). Sounds like it should work on every level doesn't it? Yeah, well it doesn't!Alien monsters named Kaijus come up through a rift in the Pacific Ocean (Get it, ""PACIFIC Rim""). Giant robots steered by military officers are used to battle these ferocious extraterrestrials. Our military must join forces with the world's most annoying scientists to find a way to seal off the portal between our world and the dimension they come from.Let's start out my review on a positive note. The CGI in ""Pacific Rim"" looks great. The aliens and robots blend very well with all their surroundings.And that's the only thing I can come up with positive about ""Pacific Rim."" As a whole, the movie is absolutely unbearable to sit through. It escapes me how sequences of robots and aliens fighting each other could be so uninspiring that I literally dozed off at points.The design of the Kaijus are completely unoriginal and nothing we haven't seen before in a dozen other sci-fi movies. The Jaegers are basically souped-up giant robots that resemble what we've seen in ""Power Rangers"" dressed in ""Halo"" armor. Booooring.Now we move into character development. The entire middle of the movie is one big, long, drawn-out attempt at developing characters we will feel emotionally tied to. I completely understand the writer's motivation for doing this.The problem is that every character in ""Pacific Rim"" is so annoying you actually want them to die or exit the screen as quickly as possible. Add to this the fact that not a single one of the actors seem to give a crap about their stereotypical role in the film and you have a serious problem. In a nutshell, the acting is absolutely horrid.""Pacific Rim"" is a tired conglomeration of clichÃ©s we've already seen in way better movies in the past. There are so many recycled ideas mashed up in it that you could almost put them down on a call sheet as bullet points. Character who lost his brother in a past battle and retired? Check. He's being called back into duty by his old military leader? Check. Military leader gets a chance to be the hero and sacrifice himself in one last battle? Check. Military leader gets to give long rousing inspirational speech just like the one the President gives in ""Independence Day?"" Check. They're all here for your predictable enjoyment.Let's just call ""Pacific Rim"" what it really is. It's Guillermo del Toro's failed attempt at making what he wished was his essential ""Ultraman vs. Godzilla"" homage. As I was running out of words to use in place of ""unoriginal,"" I came across several synonyms that describe this movie to a tee: dull, unoriginal, corny, heavy-handed, humdrum, ordinary, phoned in, stale, uncreative, unexciting, unimaginative, unimpressive, uninspiring, uninteresting, and uninventive.I'm giving parents a warning in closing. There's no way any child under the age of 12 will sit through ""Pacific Rim."" Absolutely nothing exciting happens for 45 minutes in the middle, at which time they will get uncontrollably antsy and beg you to leave. This won't bother you because you'll be ready to run out of the theater screaming by then anyway.","

"tieman64","17 March 2015","""Everything is equal. We have no borders between robots and people. In the foreign stories, robots are always the enemies. In Japan, they're our friends."" - Osamu Kozaki Japan's obsession with robots stretches back to the 1950s, when robot mangas like ""Astro Boy"" and ""Tetsujin-28"" became popular. Inspired by the US fire-bombings of Japan, and influenced by everything from Frankenstein, to 17th century karakuri puppets, to Sengoku-era samurai armour, to WW2-era hardware, to the Shinto belief that ""everything has a soul"", these robots would spawn countless animated television series, most notably ""Giant Robo"", ""Voltron"", ""Gundam Suit"", ""Robotech"", ""Evangelion"" and ""Mazinga Z"", the latter of which was very popular in Mexico during the 1980s.Mexico during the 1980s also happened to be where a young Guillermo del Toro lived. He devoured these robot cartoons, a childhood feast which would inspire his own Giant Robot Feature, ""Pacific Rim"".Released in 2013, ""Pacific Rim"" stars Charlie Hunnan as Raleigh Becket, a hotshot Jaeger pilot. Giant nuclear powered robots, Jaeger's are humanity's last line of defence against the Kaijus, colossal beasts who attack Earth via portals deep within the Pacific Ocean. As the neural load of Jaeger's is too dangerous for a lone pilot to handle, each Jaeger is piloted by two psychically linked pilots, a concept dubbed ""drifting"".Tonally, ""Pacific Rim"" is unlike most modern blockbusters. Directed by every boy's inner child, Guillermo's film knows its a ridiculous cartoon but nevertheless adopts a sincere, straight-faced stance. Elsewhere the film's carnage is undercut by ""Rim's"" warmhearted subplots, in which feuding pilots learn to work together, put differences aside and ""drift in the same direction"". That this direction amounts to collaborative warfare is something Guillermo, an outspoken pacifist, can't avoid, but he nevertheless strips his film of all the war-porn tropes which usually bog down similar films.""Pacific Rim"" was a box-office dud in the United States, a country which likes its anime re-packaged a certain way (""The Matrix"", ""Edge of Tomorrow"", ""Inception"", ""Black Swan"" etc). Guillermo del Toro mostly doesn't abide by these cosmetic conventions, his film light but never flippant, unpretentious, devoid of unnecessary subplots/dialogue masquerading as ""depth"", and free of all the usual totems of Americana. Perhaps because of this, the film was a massive hit in Japan and China.Aesthetically, ""Rim's"" also a bit unique. Guillermo's Godzilla-battles take place amidst giant waves, his behemoths covered in sea-spray, knee-deep in roiling rain-spattered oceans, their chassis lit by kaleidoscopic purples, blues and pinks. The film's creature designs and fisticuffs are also better than average for this genre, complete with elbow rockets, plasma cannons and gigantic brass knuckles. The film co-stars Idris Elba. Its butt-kicking electro-metal score, by Ramin Djawadi, signals Guillermo's premise with capital letters: HERE THERE BE GIANT ROBOTS PUNCHING GIANT ALIENS IN THE FACE.8/10 â See ""The Host"" (2006).","

"Quinoa1984","8 November 2014","It was a curious thing being on line for certain Hollywood programmers in summer 2013, mediocre stuff like 2 Guns or White House Down that neither impressed nor offended too much, and then the split in hearing some other folks talking about Pacific Rim and how awful it looked.Perhaps I came to it with a small chip on the shoulder â this is THE Guillermo mother-flipping del Toro, after all, a man who has created dark, supremely designed imaginations with Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy movies, and here he is getting to take on stuff he loves in a completely B-movie landscape: gnarly monsters, giant robots, comic-book stakes, and action with some substance. And Pacific Rim, for what it set out to accomplish as a sensational blockbuster, reached its aims for what I wanted. When taken in total, it may not have much more or less action than a Man of Steel, but it is much smarter, or just more creative and skilled and knowing of its audience, in layering out its action set pieces, and even in the broad strokes it takes as, basically, a B-level Saturday matinÃ©e flick. Del Toro cares about these characters, or at least tries to, deep down, and can show some of that like with the Asian pilot Mako Maori.Is any of this deep? I'm still not sure. Does it need to be an artistic meditation on the cancelling of the apocalypse? Maybe another watch or two of five - because there will always be a part of me that can keep a hold on to an inner 13 year old - will bring that into focus. And aside from the monsters-and-robot work, which contains such good sights to behold, weight and depth to the designs, and the know-how to pace the action and to let us see it â in 2D, anyway, I didn't bother with 3D so I can't speak to that experience â there's some just good fun dialog (Charlie Day! Ron Perlman!!) and a sense that, 'Yes, this is a Godzilla experience, but we can still make it EXCITING'. So much of what I wanted this summer and only got in smaller doses (look at the end of the article for a bit on that) was in full-bloom in this production, which had a 190 million budget and the money looked like it was up on the screen, and not just in the CG but in the big sets and technology, and a story told by a Big Kid that would only hope the rest of the audience can genuinely feel like Big Kids if they aren't young already.In other words, the director accomplished what Michael Bay has, over and over again, failed to do: inspire wonder, and put some basic thought into the process itself, in story and craft, and without a large dollop of cynicism.","

"Aaron1375","28 July 2013","There were certain things I enjoyed as a child. One was giant monster movies such as Godzilla and another were giant robots. So this movie would have been right up my alley. It still is something I wanted to see as it is also very anime like in the way it plays out. It has an anime inspired look and also add the Guillermo Del Toro factor and you end up with one very cool action movie featuring giant mechanized robots fighting huge monsters that were even given the name they have in Japan, Kaiju. Granted, it was not perfect as the look of the film was spectacular and the action grand, the story just was a bit to by the numbers and the acting at time serviceable and at other times a bit like they were not being directed to do nothing more than to open and close their mouths. Still, Del Toro is more of a visual director in my view as I enjoy the first two Blade films equally, liking the first one's story better, but liking the overall style and look of the second better (Del Toro's).The story has the earth under assault. Some sort of rift has appeared in the Pacific Ocean and huge beasts are coming through causing havoc. At first, it is believed to be an isolated incident, but it turns out that these things keep coming. The earth reacts by building huge robots called Jaegers to combat this monsters. The Jaegers turn the tide momentarily, but the monsters that come through keep getting bigger and adapt their fighting style. A man who used to partner with his brother, piloting a Jaeger called the Gypsy Danger is working on a wall that is being erected to stop the Kaiju as the Jaegers and their pilots are being killed at an ever increasing rate. This man lost his brother and now is asked to team up and pilot the Gypsy Danger for one more mission to close the rift and stop the Kaiju from entering our world.Like I said, the film has great visuals and that is the star of the piece. So much so that I still give the film a nine despite the many flaws with the story. The robots look good and the monster pretty cool too as one of the monsters near the end even sprouts wings and resembles the Gamera nemesis Gyaos. However, I wish they did a bit more to make the monsters look a bit more distinct as the robots look all different, but the monsters tended to resemble one another. Still, there are some great fights and as I said with a Del Toro film it is usually the visuals that are the highlight and they do not disappoint here.So a fun movie to watch, at one point the pilot of the Gypsy Danger activates a rocket on the arm to make the robot punch harder and I was thinking ""Rocket Punch!"" from an anime I had seen as a kid. If they could have added a bit more humor to the film it would have been a near perfect film for me. The ending was a bit to predictable too. Overall, the experience was satisfying and I am a bit sad to see this film not doing better at the box office here as I would love to see a sequel mainly due to curiosity in how it would play out. So a very nice film, to bad it did not come out when I was younger.","

"michaelRokeefe","8 August 2013","Trying not to get too technical, which some reviewers have the right know-how to do that sort of thing...but I was just taken in by the grandeur; F/X to the max. Gigantic monsters and equally big machines to fight them; not just big, but BIG! Enough of that. The amazing Guillermo del Toro directs, helps write and produce this science fiction spectacle. Sometime in the 2020's, the Earth is attacked at various locations by enormous monsters, that have found a super dimensional portal at the bottom of the ocean. The monsters seem to have the same genetics, but no two seem to look alike. And each has its unique method of fighting...each method leaving massive destruction. World wide international scientists and computer wizards/geeks pool knowledge. Gigantic humanoid transformer-like fighters, dubbed Jaegers, are created to fight the attacking monsters called Kaijus. Years come and go; the Kaijus keep coming while the united world forces run through numerous versions of Jaegers, that require two pilots and joined mind-control via a neutral bridge to operate. Cutting to a climax if you will; a brooding, washed-up Jaeger pilot, Raleigh Beckett(Charlie Hunnam)and a rookie, female pilot, Mako(Rinko Kikuchi), are a last hope to take a re-fitted, original Jaeger to the Pacific Rim location of the multi-dimensional, siphon like portal and destroy it to save all humanity. Simple,huh? Fantastic enough to hold your attention for over two hours. Kikuchi has the awesome talent and good looks to short circuit a pacemaker. Others in the cast: Idris Elba, Charlie Day, Burn Gorman, Diego Klattenhoff and Ron Perlman. You just don't take in PACIFIC RIM...it sucks YOU in!","

"feritciva","8 August 2013","Let's be honest, lately we've seen so much ridiculously horrible alien invaders movies that even Independence Day is like a golden classic now. Battle L.A., Battleship, last Transformers movie (was it the 9th? 11th? I forgot!), District 9 (yes, it was horrible too) etc..So when I've heard about Pacific Rim I thought ""oh no, not another one"" and ignored it. Then, I saw the ratings and some reviews here on IMDb. OK another confession now, IMDb also let me down lately because people were voting like they've never seen a good movie or good script. Go look at Dark Knight Rising's IMDb rating, for God's sake! (my right eye began to twitch involuntary when I thought of Dark Knight Rising again.. aaarrrgghh) But then one day destiny did the job for me, here I was having nothing to do with spare time and an imax cinema with Pacific Rim. I looked at other movies, Wolverine - check, I've already been to, good movie. Red 2, check - it was great fun. World War Z, unfortunately check, waste of time. Pacific Rim? OK, why not? After 2,5 hours the lights were on again and I was sitting with a big grin on my face apologizing from everyone who worked for this movie. This is really amazing folks. This is old skool fun! This is really better than last 5 years' alien invasion movies all together! This just popped out from 80's with 2010's technology. Do not miss it! And try to catch it on imax 3D! You'll never regret it!","

"Theo Robertson","29 March 2015","I wonder how the pitch meeting for this film went . No let me guess ...""I've a great idea . Earth gets invaded by giant lizards and people controlling giant robots . A bit like Godzilla meets Transformers but instead of getting our ass sued for plagiarism we call the lizards Kaijus and the robots Jaegers . Please sign your cheques to ..."" ""Don't bother wasting our time sonny . Next please"" ""Six horny teenagers are driving along and their car breaks down in a dark forest and ..."" This isn't what actually happened and the unimaginative studio executives green lit the film which is indeed GODZILLA vs TRANSFORMERS . If you've seen the trailers and clips you'll know what you're getting Summer blockbuster spectacle and possibly like me you gave it a very wide berth . Wait a minute though , perhaps Mexican Guillermo Del Toro is conscious of this and has done something that at first hand seems impossible - he's made a Summer FX driven spectacular blockbuster that is genuinely fun With the opening three minutes that could have been a movie in its own he tells the audience everything they need to know including a well thought out reason as to why humanity needs to build giant human powered robots but it's with the human elements he hits the bulls eye . Again being non American he's probably well aware that international audiences get a bit fed up watching hunky square jawed brave Americans saving mankind so he's brought a multinational twist to the story . The head of the military is black? Fair enough but why's he talking with a London accent worthy of Dick Van Dyke himself ? Who cares and we have American actors playing British characters complete with weird accents and no one in this film is capable of doing an Australian accent and it sums up the rest of the characters and the film itself where everything is camp , colourful and there's a constant wink to the audience that's constantly saying "" Look this is absolute B movie nonsense but come on you're enjoying every single silly minute of this aren't you ?"" I know I enjoyed every single silly minute of this B movie nonsense . Put Del Toro in charge of Hollywood blockbusters now","

"billygoat1071","11 July 2013","Pacific Rim takes inspiration from the elements of any material that involves giant creatures and robots. It shows a simple concept about piloted robots, Jaegers, fighting against sea aliens, Kaijus. This idea alone would already make a fantastic blockbuster. The surprise we get is it features more than just endless explosions. There are plenty of innovations to root for which it can almost be a new popular classic. The only less intriguing parts however are the clichÃ©s that are too known in many big sci-fi action movies. Despite of that, it kept the promise of being gigantically awesome. It's not completely groundbreaking, but it's still quite an experience.Aside from the large scale battles, the film amazingly creates an innovating futuristic alternate universe. It tells the origins of the Kaijus and how the Jaegers work, shows what society and the media have become, and throw some satires of the genre. The exploration of the vision is so absorbing, it feels like you went to it as a trip. But what somewhat halts this from being larger than life is when it takes the generic elements of any typical blockbuster, like the hero's motivations, the main robot is somehow an underdog in one scene, there's an arrogant team member, sacrifices, and so on. It's hard to not notice them since they are the central points of the story. The intriguing stuff about the Jaegers and Kaijus still took over the experience. At least it embraces its own fantasy tastes without being ""dark"" and emo like today's blockbuster trend.Charlie Hunnam's performance is fitting to a graphic novel based movie, which is kind of appropriate as his role. In the battle scenes, he gives genuine human emotions as he punches and fall. Idris Elba remarkably brings heart to the picture while being awesome at the same time. Rinko Kikuchi makes her character more than just a partner of Raleigh. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman delightfully serves more energy to the story, while Ron Perlman appears in a short screen time but satisfying enough.Now the real highlight of the picture, the visuals are overall shiny and snazzy. The designs of the creatures and robots are palpably marvelous. As the special effects move these heavy giants, the action did something better than just blowing up stuff. Although explosions and loud noises are not actually flaws(It's about giant robots, c'mon!), but a real good set piece needs a decent and genuine fortitude. In the midst of the noises, you will always get the sense of danger to the Jaegers, mostly because there are human pilots beneath the ravaging machines. It effectively made those sequences electrifying and the monsters terrifying than you would expect.Pacific Rim will have its own fans. It feels like a self-indulged blockbuster that people will end up loving. Besides, this film is said to be Guillermo del Toro's dream come true coming from his childhood. And seeing all that, there's plenty of things to explore and to be intrigued. If only the plot can break some points from the mainstream storytelling, it would have been less predictable and much extraordinary. But physically, it is extraordinary. It's both big and eye candy which is the snazziest merit you will see. Also in the action scenes where it's more into the thrills than the fireworks, because it's all about iron fists hitting on monsters' face. Again, the story may be familiar, but the setting and the action keeps everything looks fresh and amazing.","

"nogodnomasters","29 July 2018","The film opens with a narration. It explains that a portal has opened connecting us to another universe in the Pacific Rim. Through this hole emerges destructive creatures from 60's Japanese films, updated of course. In a missed plot point, conventional means of fighting them seem to be useless, so we construct 100-150 foot tall robots called Jaegers to combat them. Missiles fired from Jaegers are effective, but...okay I tried not to think too hard about it.The Jaegesr are controlled by 2 people, dressed in ""Star Wars"" storm trooper gear, that are in a mind meld that would make Spock green with envy. They are called pilots because Jaeger masters might be a copyright infringement.The film combines elements of ""Independence Day,"" ""Starship Troopes,"" ""Transformers"" and ""Ironman"" and sets them into a stolen Japanese plot. Of course the rule is if you steal a plot from Japan you have to hire someone from Japan to be in the film, hence we have Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori. She will eventually team up with John Rico, eh ah Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam because Casper Van Dien is too old) to fight against the monsters coming at an increasing rate. There is a subplot that includes Ron Perlman and Charlie Day.There are two schools of thought. One is to use the Jaegers to kill the creatures, the other is to build a war to keep out the illegal aliens. When the wall fails to keep out the illegal aliens, the Jaegers can defend the world thanks to ""stand your ground"" principles. Pardon my attempt at political humor.The supporting characters were better written than the main ones.This is an over dramatic, action packed popcorn film. The language is designed to appeal to a teen/young adult audience. Looks good on the big screen.Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb. No sex or nudity.","

"aaronjbong","11 July 2013","""Pacific Rim"" is a highly explosive, exhilarating, exuberant, energetic, and exciting hell of a ride. When I saw the trailers, I knew the action sequences would be massive in scale, but the film just blew me away because the scale was just incredibly enormous. Every action sequence in this film was just mind-blowing. Unlike ""Transformers"", this movie has a real sensible plot. Giant monsters (known as Kaijus) are the extraterrestrial beings that are currently ravaging Earth. However, they don't come from above the atmosphere, instead they come from beneath us. A portal in the bottom of the ocean serves as the method of transport these Kaijus use to reach us. These Kaijus are arriving one by one, and as they do, they increase in size. They're so massive in size (I reckon they're bigger than Godzilla) and the amount of destruction they cause is just indescribable. But the humans don't stand around doing nothing. They build their own monsters, gigantic robots known as Jaegars, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked by a neural bridge. This allows them to synchronize their movements. However, despite these mighty Jaegers, the seemingly bright future for the humans turn dim as they begin to lose the war against the Kaijus. All of this was clearly covered in the prologue, quickly but properly. Now that seems like a basic plot, but I can tell you that there's actually more than that and the story is deeper than it looks from the outside. ""Pacific Rim"" provides sensible explanations for the phenomenons that occurred in the film. Now I'm not a genius or a scientist, but the explanation is logical. The characters. Our protagonist is Raleigh Becket. He's had a bad time after his partner and older brother Yancy died in a battle against a Kaiju before. But he's recruited by Marshal Stacker Pentecost to pilot one of the four remaining Jaegers. His new partner is Mako Mori, a Japanese girl who wants to be a pilot to avenge the death of her family. Becket's and Mori's Jaeger is the American-made Gypsy Heart. The cast behind the characters were great too. Charlie Hunnam was terrific as Raleigh. Idris Elba gave a commanding performance as Stacker. Rinko Kikuchi rocked as Mako Mori. The chemistry between Hunnam and Kikuchi was excellent too. But I have to give special credit to Ron Perlman (who previously played in del Toro's ""Hellboy"" films) as the black marketeer Hannibal Chau who makes a living by dealing with Kaiju organs. He has style and charisma. I also loved Burn Gorman and Charlie Day as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb and Dr. Newton Geizler, respectively. Their chemistry was absolutely perfect and these two were just amazing. The visual effects were undoubtedly incredible. Everything was mind-blowing and the gigantic scale of the action sequences allows you to be fully immersed into the scene. And the sets were extremely magnificent and glorious. I did not feel any sense of boredom when I was watching this film. Even the drama scenes were enjoyable too. The scenes where explanations were uncovered were exciting too and the music is a prominent part of this. Guillermo del Toro also did a great job in his directing because I gradually became supportive of the Jaegers and every time they fought, I rooted for them to win. I became immersed into the movie. Every time a Jaeger was in trouble, I was rooting for them to get back up and fight back again. I wanted them to smash the Kaijus to pieces. ""Pacific Rim"" is just simply awesome. Now, it may not be for everyone, but if you love action, giant monsters, and giant robots, you'll definitely love this. Or if you're just trying to have some fun, watch this. It's got both brains and brawn. Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: ""Pacific Rim"" is an amazing and explosive ride that is plenty of fun to watch, accompanied with dazzling visuals and a coherent plot.","

"BlairMcLovin","11 July 2013","Within the opening 15 or so minutes Charlie Hunnam's voice-over establishes the reality of a future where monsters (the Kaiju) repeatedly invade earth, to stem this humans have created giant robots (Jaegers) to combat them in increasingly badass iterations. This opening does a great job in conveying the scope of a film which is big, not just regular big, but like, Jason Biggs in 1999 bigg. entering the cinema from a world where these events rarely occur is initially a lot to throw at the audience, but it's handled so effectively and without tongue in cheek that it quickly becomes a world I had a blast experiencing. Maybe it was the incredible effects shots of robot related destruction used as a throwaway shots, but what I think really sold the opening sequence and the film as a whole is the enthusiasm Del Toro clearly has for the story he's telling.The cast is essentially a rogues gallery of TV's better dramas playing variations on roles they've nailed in the past (see: Elba, Hunnam and Klattenhoff) and some inspired casting of It's Always Sunny's Charlie Day who, as should be expected provides some effective comedic relief. Added onto this the score comes courtesy of Ramin Djawadi who's masterful use of themes on Game of Thrones is carried over to this film for some great emotional cues and many a rad motif courtesy of Tom Morello on guitar.It's appropriate Del Toro has a Frankenstein adaptation lined up as a follow up project as Pacific Rim can at times can feel stitched together from all the sources of inspiration the film has. This comes from many areas such as Japanese manga, the personalities of the actors from previous films and the imagery of robots destroying buildings which transformers ran into the ground. But Del Toro succeeds time and time again at allowing these disparate elements to fit together believably by way of some very confident filmmaking. I could easily take issue with the oft hammy dialogue and macho relationships but where the film succeeds in other areas and revels in creativity trumps the dissatisfaction one could take from these scenes. I also found Hunnams character a tad lacking in charisma and internal conflict but whatever, it's not the end of the world. Oh wait, yes it is hahahahaÂ The films successes go beyond its imagery and continued invention within battle scenes as the script is very economical when it comes to pacing. The films battle scenes are so engaging and exciting due to clearly established stakes present which left me devoid of the ""action fatigue"" transformers loves to throw my way. And although the Kaiju battles seem to never be in short supply, the film essentially follows the rule of three when it comes to battle sequences and left me oh so satisfied.In conclusion, I give it points for being one of the funner summer blockbusters in recent memory, for being an original property and for its sheer tenacity to exist which all amount to what is just a darn good time at the movies.","

"PWNYCNY","24 July 2013","This is a good movie. The question is: why? The movie is loaded up with special effects, has a lot of cheesy acting, tells a ridiculous story, and in some ways is a rip off of monster movies from the past. Based on that, this movie should qualify as a bomb. Yet it is not a bomb; this movie is good because it is unpretentious. It is what it is and is so without apology. Indeed, this movie glorifies the monster movie genre; it takes it to a higher, more sublime, level. Here the director lets out all the stops and lets the debris settle where it may. The movie conveys a positive message. It is about teamwork and about how humans are able to unite to solve problems. The monsters themselves are not especially surprising. Similar types can be found in many other monster movies. But what is different is how they are treated by the humans and how the humans respond to them. Unlike other monster movies which show humans in mass panic mode, this movie portrays humans as being stalwart and in control. You know they will beat the monsters; it's just a question of how. The monsters are another problem to be solved and the humans do a great job of solving it. This movie is worth watching.","

"swp_1988","10 July 2013","We all carry a great sense of wonder. It seems to hide away as we get older, but was always strong and persistent when we were children. We could sit down and really make something out of nothing physical, or tip our toy-box all over the floor and just go mad. Pacific Rim is Guillermo Del Toro at his most unleashed. He's been given the toys for his sandpit and has gone completely bonkers, but he has also created a sense of wonder from completely nothing.The plot is simple. Kaiju (monsters) from another dimension break through to ours and wage war on the planet and us humans must do what we can to stop them. So we build giant machines called Jaegers. General audiences are doing the worst thing by comparing this to Transformers or Battleship simply because of some simple image traits. Well I'm here to tell you that you're way off and also working comparisons in the wrong league. Del Toro has crafted an insane amalgamation of Sci-Fi, old-school thrills, special effects and brilliantly entertaining set pieces that all meld together in beautiful harmony, with just enough satisfying human moments and arcs that carry a nice balance of emotion and camp. It all blends well with the loopiness of it all. Its Guillermo Del Toro's trademarks turned up to 11, all while going nuts and having fun with his toys.There's just so much to love, that not even some minor pacing problems or a couple of sub-par performances can destroy the experience. Mainly its in the lesser background characters, but for me I'd say that Charlie Hunnam doesn't quite shine in the lead. He's certainly more than commendable, but he just doesn't break out here. Idris Elba steals the spotlight with a look and a bellowed delivery and its amusing to watch and Rinko Kikuchi has such an incredible skill with her mannerism and in her eyes, that's its a shock that she isn't in more films. Ron Perlman comes and goes and works his usual incredible moments.Pacific Rim is triumphant above the rest of the blockbuster herd. It knows what is missing from the norm and just goes crazy with it. Its a big, giant load of awesome fun. Prepare your jaw muscles, because you'll be smiling throughout.(Hint: Stay a couple of minutes into the end credits for an awesome additional scene)","

"SnoopyStyle","27 December 2013","A trans-world rip at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean has allowed monsters, named Kaiju, to come into our world. After tremendous losses, the world got together to build massive robots called Jaegers. However, the monsters keep coming, faster and bigger. Now the Jaegers are stretched to the limit with resources being diverted to building a wall.Director Guillermo del Toro is having a lot of boyhood fun with robots battling monsters. It doesn't get more childhood fun than this. The designs are beautiful and original with both the robots and monsters. There is nothing more youth affirming than playing with these toys. The characters are solid with interesting actors like Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba. Coming into this, I feared the story would be too silly or convoluted. The story makes perfect sense and the action cannot be beat.","

"matthewlintschinger","19 August 2013","Entertainment is not just a story. It is not just drama or social commentary. It is not something that can be measured by terms like ""latest and greatest"" or ""cutting edge"". This movie is not Man of Steel or Star Trek into Darkness where there is a child-like obsession with being ""taken seriously"" by adding grotesque violence or depressing overtones. This is not Transformers 3 or the Hobbit where special effects and action scenes are a cluttered mess of ADD rave parties that try to up the excitement with jumpy editing. THIS IS A SINCERE MOVIE.Sure it has lack luster actors, but they are mixed with some fine ones as well. Yes this has giant robots and that is the main reason to see the film, but they are not just jingling keys in front of us. These action scenes have atmosphere. The fights are exciting because of anticipation and build up. This movie (while very flawed) should be a model example of popcorn entertainment. I came in, saw some good fights, and got a happy ending without bullshit. This was the kind of fun I remember as a kid.This is a movie (strangely enough like John Carter) that should just be enjoy. They may not have had the best plots or most original stories, but they had substance that can honestly be felt. Genuine love for what they are doing in the film and real effort in making us as the audience part of that fun. They can be dumb or dull, but it feels more like a circumstance of a rushed schedule or odd-ball casting. It feels like Hollywood at its best since they just want us to have a good time.I not only hope for a sequel, I hope for loving imitators who don't aspire to pretentious greatness (Rise of the Guardians), don't have something to immaturely prove (Man of Steel), and actually have their own story to tell even if its derivative (Star Trek into Darkness is not only a Rip-off of Wrath of con, but it is practically a sequel that is DEPENDANT on it).This is not the degradation of film, this is the much needed laxative in a world of fast edited adaptations, sequels, and reboots with emo endings.","

"dee.reid","22 July 2013","For ""kaiju-eiga"" (Japanese monster movie) fan-boys, ""Pacific Rim"" has been one of the most eagerly anticipated summer blockbusters for several years now, and for good reason. Due to the passing of legendary special effects artist Ray Harryhausen earlier this year (the film is dedicated to his memory and that of famous Japanese movie director Ishiro Honda - who passed away 20 years ago in 1993), the failure of ""Godzilla"" in 1998, and the reasonable successes of the American found footage/monster flick ""Cloverfield"" in 2008 and South Korea's ""The Host"" in 2006, the monster-on-the-rampage genre has seen some increased relevancy, and legitimacy, in the last decade.As someone who grew up with, and idolized, Godzilla and other famed Japanese movie monsters - Ishiro Honda's ""Gojira"" (1954), Godzilla's dark, gloomy black & white debut, remains the greatest monster movie ever - ""Pacific Rim"" was the first movie I've seen in the movie theater this year, and it was a choice that was well-worth my hard-earned $7.50. I also belong to a Godzilla fan-boy group on Facebook. Upon the release of ""Pacific Rim"" on July 12, 2013, the page ignited with impassioned fan-boy discussions of what could easily be considered the greatest giant monster movie so far this millennium (if ever, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here - ""Gojira"" is still the best this genre has to offer). I'm inclined to agree.I greatly admired J. J. Abrams's take on the monster movie genre with ""Cloverfield,"" and I thought that ""The Host"" was a welcome surprise from one of the last places to pop up on the world cinema market. Now with ""Pacific Rim,"" famed Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's big-budget take on the genre (as well as serving as a delightful homage to his childhood fan-boy obsessions in comic books, Godzilla, Japanese Anime', pop culture, and fantasy) has arrived.Equal parts ""Avatar"" (2009), ""District 9"" (2009), 1998 ""Godzilla,"" Iron Man, ""Top Gun"" (1986), ""Transformers,"" and del Toro's own fervent imagination (together with co-screenwriter Travis Beacham), and featuring an epic score by Ramin Djawadi (which comes close to rivaling the best of the famous Japanese film composer Akira Ifukube), ""Pacific Rim"" begins sometime in the near-future, when mankind is at war with giant, other-worldly sea monsters called ""Kaiju"" (the Japanese word for ""monster"") bent on our destruction. To combat them, we have the Jaegers (the German word for ""hunter""), 250-foot-tall heavily armed, heavily armored giant robots that are piloted by two people who mind-meld to form a single unified consciousness - the better to operate them and fight the Kaiju, we're told.The film's strongest visual appeal comes from the giant monster-robot battles that dominate the film's loudest moments (and pretty much the entire second half of the picture). In today's times, special effects no longer serve to simply enhance movie scenery - as they did in time's past - but essentially to create them. There are some movies in recent years where special effects - namely CGI - are used to create an entire movie and actors seem almost like an after-thought. In recalling the movie, I found it to be a relief that there seems to be a more intricate balance between the battle sequences and the scenes with the flesh & blood human characters.And we get some truly likable, flesh & blood human characters in the form of a jaded former ace Jaeger pilot named Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who is called back into the line of duty to once again combat the Kaiju threat; also on-board is his former chief, the hard-nosed Stacker Pentecoast (Idris Elba), who lends the movie sex appeal and scenery-chewing military command presence; and lastly, there's the beautiful, ambitious Jaeger pilot-trainee Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi).Backing them up, is their loyal, wise-cracking systems administrator Tendo Choi (Clifton Collins, Jr.), and a pair of goofy, bumbling Jaeger research scientists - Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) - who make several fundamental discoveries about the Kaiju that may just turn the tide of the war in favor of humanity. And, it'll be impossible to miss him, but del Toro's regular go-to guy Ron Perlman (best known from del Toro's earlier ""Hellboy"" superhero movies and ""Blade II"") also shows up as a leather-skinned, back-alley Hong Kong black marketer named Hannibal Chau.As a director and screenwriter, del Toro has always given his films rich character and thematic depth, and philosophical complexity (and not to mention a fine sense of humor, which many big-budget blockbusters these days often tend to lack); ""Pacific Rim"" does not rank up there with his most famous picture to date, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (2006), but it's actually much closer to his aforementioned ""Hellboy"" films and ""Blade II"" (2002). It's a blockbuster movie, but one that is not without some degree of humanistic depth and merit. The film's core theme revolves around the benefits of working together - ""two heads are better than one,"" as they say - and this is taken to a somewhat literal degree here, in which empathy (the ability to understand another person's feelings) is seen as a bona-fide superpower in and of itself that is capable of allowing just two people to power towering robots to effectively battle an unspeakable threat to humanity.It is this purely humanistic touch that takes the spectacle away from the many dazzling special effects-driven action sequences that ""Pacific Rim"" has to offer and instead places it on the human characters at the center of it all. This is something that is purely at the center of much of Guillermo del Toro's best work.10/10.","

"horizon2008","21 July 2013","The thing about a movie like this is, we all want to see the big robots fight the big monsters. Simple as that. The downside is, you have to suffer all the boring drama bits between the action to get there.I've never understood why it is so many directors feel they have to have some tedious love interest in action flicks, it just totally takes the edge of the tension. Then we have the really nerdy and half crazy scientist types who, while portrayed as seemingly brilliant in their field, come across as almost insane. Has anyone ever seen a scientist behave like this? I mean in the real world? Nope, me neither, but it seems movieland feels that's how we should see them all. It's bloody irritating if you ask me. And Pacific Rim has its very own who really bugged me while on screen. Please can we have some normal scientists in these kind of movies please? Although given the plots are so outrageous maybe that just wouldn't work so well.Anyway, getting to the action. It's good. It's really good, although sometimes it's a little hard to make out what's going on during the close-up fighting. Among horror fans, CGI is hated, as we love the day's of olde with lashings of fake blood and latex, but without the runaway developments of CGI it would be impossible to make a film like this. I reckon Pacific Rim is the ultimate demonstration of the top end of where we are right now in computer based effects. What you see on screen is truly stunning, moreso the big manmade battle machines than the monsters I must say. I enjoyed the movie a lot. It's maybe a little over-long with those slow drama scenes, but the onslaught of the mega battles certainly makes up for that. Good stuff then, for something so big and hollywoodesque.","

"DareDevilKid","25 July 2013","Rating: 4/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Not since ""Jurassic Park"" have I had the utmost pleasure of witnessing such a great monster sci-fi mash-up. Like ""Jurassic Park"", ""Them"", ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"", and other classics of the genre, ""Pacific Rim"" too intersperses the plot and back-story succinctly well as the action unfolds. The characters and their journey are given adequate footage as the monsters v/s robots action. More importantly, as the action unfolds, every single shot, each and every sequence is beautifully captured like a ballet reaching its crescendo.Unlike most gigantic FX laden pseudo sci-fi blockbusters like the ""Transformers"" franchise and ""Iron Man 3"", this films pays immense detail to certain laws of physics and plain simple logic. The action unfolds in a grand spectacle and straps you in for a roller-coaster ride. But it also pays respect to your senses and enables you to minutely follow each aspect of how the fight scenes are choreographed. Wish all gargantuan CGI driven films were like this.The film stays true to classic monster movies and also to its anime roots. Fans of both, anime and monster movies will be able to detect many subtle references to past classics and popular culture. In the end, ""Pacific Rim"" is summer blockbuster entertainment at its best and you'll be craving for a second viewing once the experience soaks in.","

"jdkraus","1 August 2013","A friend of mine described this feature as being so corny that it is enjoyable. He is not the only one who thinks this. Director and writer Guillermo Del Toro was not trying to accomplish anything inventive or groundbreaking with this movie--like with ""Blade 2"" and the ""Hellboys"" he was going for pure entertainment. In this arena, ""Pacific Rim"" excels. It is jaw-dropping and awe-inspiring to watch on the big screen with deafening surround sound and beautiful visual effects that should steal the golden statue. The plot is simple and basic. Monsters have come to invade from another world and humanity has to defeat them before the planet is obliterated. The monsters are known as Kaiju (Japanese word for monster) and the machines that the humans have built to fight them are called Jaegars (in German means hunter). Combined with a ten minute intro by the main character, which brilliantly sets up the story without being too technical and daunting, followed by a remaining plot that progresses without boredom makes what could have been a dull clichÃ© intriguing. The characters at first glance seem to be the generic types in this type of a movie. A hero who lost his brother to the monsters (Hunnam). A quiet, modest Japanese girl who wants revenge (Kikuchi). An aging badass leader who is the glue that keeps the company going (Idris Elba). A couple of quirky scientists (Day and Gorman). And even a dog and a slimy black market dealer (Perlman). But as the movie charges forward, such common characters are forgivable for all the actors make their performances their own without being overly emotional or wooden. They manage to make the audience laugh and we have the tendency to cheer them on as they kick the Kaijus' asses. All in all, ""Pacific Rim"" marks as a great fun movie, even if it is about man machines beating giant reptiles to a pulp with their bare hands. Visually stunning. Meant for the big screen. Go see it before it goes into the DVD and Blu-Ray shelves at Walmart.","

"JohnWelles","7 August 2013","""Pacific Rim"", directed by Guillermo del Toro, is a science fiction film that takes a long dormant genre, the Japanese Kaiju monster films of the 1950s and 1960s. They featured such creatures as Godzilla and a variety of others, del Toro not so much reinventing it but bringing it right back up to date. George Lucas' special effects company, Industrial Light & Magic, has created a world that is in the near-future but feels like tomorrow, the textures of the both the giant ""jaegers"" and monsters so realistic that even without 3D, you can feel that you can even touch them. The effects are simply put, outstanding and so far the best this year.Yet del Toro, who directed the acclaimed Oscar-winning ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and the pair of ""Hellboy"" films, and his scriptwriter Travis Beacham, know that for the film to be more than merely ""mecha vs. monsters"", real characters need to be created and invested with real emotions. In interviews, del Toro said ""We cannot pretend this is Ibsen"", so the characters like Becket, Pentecost and Mori are strongly defined people who, through the equally powerful performances from Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba and Rinko Kikunchi give us a film where we care what happens and mean the final climactic sacrifices are actually poignant, as opposed to manufactured drama with little thought behind it.Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, who play a pair of bantering scientists along with Ron Perlman, who is a black marketer in Hong Kong dealing in kaiju organs, are vividly sketched supporting characters who provide an antidote to the seriousness of the main plot. The humour isn't cynical or used to self-consciously comment on the film, but instead springs naturally from the characters. For a film with such a potentially risible concept and execution, it's a pleasant surprise to discover it to be so well written.The art direction and design of the mechs and monsters is superb, as is the envisioning of Hong Kong, a strangely beautiful world of iridescent lights of all colours, like a pop art version of ""Blade Runner"". The cinematography of the Oscar winning Guillermo Navarro is excellent too, capturing the nuances of the oily, technical world the film lives in while also bringing out the colours for the maximum dramatic effect. The editing by Peter Amundson and John Gilroy in collaboration with del Toro wisely chooses to go for slower cuts, in particular in the many and frequent action scenes, so as to render them intelligible and to allow the audience not only to understand what is going on but also so that they know the geography of the situation.The major flaw, apart from Ramin Djawadi's blandly generic score, is perhaps the action scenes themselves. Taken individually, each one is shot and edited very well, but by the end, there is a slight, creeping sense of audience fatigue. This is compounded by the fact that the film's most memorable scene is Kikuchi's flashback, which deals with the impact and aftermath of the monsters, rather than a long, extensive battle scene.Despite this, taken as a whole, ""Pacific Rim"" is a whole lot of fun and easily the best summer blockbuster of the year. Oh, and stay through the credits: there is a nice little post-credits scene that deals with the fate of a certain character.","

"TheLittleSongbird","13 June 2016","Wasn't sure whether to check out 'Pacific Rim'. Reviews were mixed, and those who disliked it (some of vehement) were particularly vocal.This said, being someone who has found much to like about some of Guillermo Del Toro's previous films, especially the brilliant 'Pan's Labyrinth' and who cannot go wrong with actors like Idris Elba and Ron Perlman in the cast, I watched it anyway. Admittedly there are flaws here and they are quite large, but at the same time 'Pacific Rim' also does a good deal right.Starting with what 'Pacific Rim' excelled with, it is an incredible-looking film. The cinematography is immaculate, the editing slick, the set/production design audacious and with a suitable amount of grit, but the star visually is the special effects on the robots, which are mind-blowing and some of the best in recent memory. The action and spectacle is exhilarating stuff and keeps one glued to the edge of their seat, they're big and over-the-top but that was what the film was going for and it succeeds wonderfully. The music score fits very well and has several energetic and haunting moments, though occasionally some intrusive ones.Del Toro does a fine job directing in the action and succeeds in maintaining the silly fun that the film was aiming for (being apparently a homage to the old Godzillas). The film does know what it's trying to be, often has some efficient pacing and target audience is never questioned, which puts it above a fair few similar blockbusters. Not all the acting is great, but there are good performances from a commanding and coolly macho Idris Elba, a expressively understated Rinko Kikuchi and an always reliable if underused Ron Perlman.Charlie Hunnam is rather bland though in the lead, while of the failure that is the comedy double act of Charlie Day and Burn Gorman Charlie Day in particular is incredibly irritating and there are some very off Australian accents (especially from Robert Kazinsky, which keeps coming and going, often speaking in his own accent). 'Pacific Rim' also has some cringe-worthy and vomit-inducingly inane dialogue and paper thin stereotypical characterisation where not much is done to develop the characters and make one properly care for them. Unfortunately, while this reviewer is not afraid to admit that she had a fun time watching the film the story does get bogged down in the non-action scenes in derivative macho drama and over-silliness, the main culprit as aforementioned being the unfunny comedy double act, and the pacing sometimes loses tightness.All in all, kind of a mixed view on this one. Fun and very well made, but not immune to flaws. 6/10 Bethany Cox All in all,","

"seaview1","21 July 2013","Director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) has always had a fascination with fantasy and science fiction stories populated with unusual, colorful characters amid macabre settings. Originally set to direct The Hobbit films, he has, instead, switched gears and created a new film populated with mega monsters and super robotic warriors in an exciting, action spectacle, Pacific Rim. What sets this apart from most apocalyptic battles is its well developed characters and relationships. While its subject matter may not be for all tastes, it should satisfy most action and comic fans to the hilt.Set in the not too distant future, a growing threat emerges from an ocean breach in the form of enormous monsters (think Godzilla types) called Kaijus which ravage world cities. To combat these powerful creatures, world leaders construct giant war machines dubbed Jaegers which are controlled from within by a set of mind linked co-pilots. But the threat increases, and the creatures, who have remarkable, adaptive powers, duel with an ever dwindling number of outmatched Jaegers. While mentally linked, the copilots share each other's thoughts and memories. Ace pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) has traumatic memories of loss from an earlier battle and must learn to overcome this while the prospect of a new co-pilot in the form of Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) brings her own horrible past. As relationships are revealed and challenged, the monstrous Kaijus must be met in a last stand not only on land but at its mysterious source beneath the sea.While there is undeniable sexual tension between Becket and Mori, the filmmakers do not settle for clichÃ©d romantic scenes, which a nice change of pace. The film deals primarily with facing and conquering one's own demons. Themes of loyalty, duty and sacrifice crop up. There are super mind melds and a nice dash of samurai mentality in the training and battle scenes, and there are elements of other action films like The Matrix and Top Gun especially towards the end. These Jaegers have some awesome, cool weaponry, and the high tech hardware is detailed and impressive yet well used and realistic. Movies such as The Transformers and the recent super hero films have raised the stakes of massive battle sequences in an urban setting, but Pacific Rim enlarges the playing field even more. And these monsters have tricks up their sleeve that would make even Godzilla envious. Although the scale of the film is breathtaking, del Toro always keeps things grounded in reality and honest emotions. These characters have a camaraderie that evolves throughout the storyline. Just like Peter Jackson in The Lord of the Rings films, del Toro demonstrates an impressive ability to marshal large set pieces while throwing in minute details or intimate moments. These things add to the texture of the story and its players; you begin to care for them. Idris Elba is fast becoming the actor of choice (from his start on TV's The Wire through the recent Prometheus). His role as the leader of the Jaegers, is critical to the storyline, and he even gets to have his own Independence Day/Henry V rallying speech. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman are a riot as rival scientists who bicker while trying to find solutions to the crises. Long time del Toro repertory stalwart Ron Perlman has an amusing supporting role as a black marketeer.Production credits are outstanding on all facets. Special effects are through the roof, and the score by Ramin Djawadi is appropriately heroic and pulsating. Do stay for the initial end credits for an amusing bonus scene.If this is not your cup of tea, it is best avoided. It is true there are perhaps too many climactic battles of these titans (Del Toro even displays a hint of shoe fetish). Yet for those who are game, it is a fun ride and a cut above typical sci-fi fare. For fans and geeks, it is nirvana. If you're going to make a film about giant war machines fighting larger-than-life evil to save the earth and instill the requisite human element, this is a textbook example of how to do it right. Imagine that: a sci-fi blockbuster that moves you! Boy, they are going to sell a lot of toys with this one!","

"deltaforce7","16 July 2013","Alright, so these days it costs $180 millions to make a movie that is dumber than a game of ""action figures"" being played by a couple of 5 year old children with mental development issues.There is this script obviously inspired by a set of ""Mega Monster vs. Mega Robot"" plastic action figure toys. Then, a bunch of similarly plastic actors is thrown into the whole mess. Well, this is it! This awful flick is DUMBER! NOISIER! MORE BOOM AND BANG! MORE FLASHES OF COLOR LIGHTS!Not that the Pacific Rim movie deserves a discussion or anything, but the bigger any creature gets, the easier and slower target it becomes. The tiny, microscopic organisms are truly scary. But any organism bigger than an elephant stops being dangerous. I will not waste my time talking about a possible bone mass and strength that a gigantic creature would require or speculating about a quantity of food needed to supply energy to a walking tower of flesh. I mean, dinosaurs died out on their own, because they were way too big (most of them were pretty big, you know).So, what would stop the military forces from taking down those slow and huge monsters using tactical nuclear missiles? Do not tell me that a 10 or 20 kiloton warhead would not kill any creature of any size by essentially evaporating it (with not too much collateral and fallout). So, what happened to the tactical nukes in this movie? Whoever made Pacific Rim never heard of such weapons? They demonstrated some F-22 fighter planes (no A-10 attack planes were available?) flying at the monsters and shooting CANNONS! Well, then the makers of this movie are dumber than those who volunteered to watch Pacific Rim and then came here to leave the 10-star reviews! WHY NOT hire any military consultans??? Anyway, what is this pathetic obsession with the giant walking robots, transformers and stuff?Go watch this movie and experience your IQ dropping 40-50 points. Honestly, if movies like this one are made AND watched, then we truly live under a social system known as IDIOCRACY or probably IDIOTISM.","

"AlsExGal","28 September 2014","... or do I just have standards? Someone in the comment section said ""Is this the most stupid movie ever or what ...highly advanced alien civilization trying to invade earth using giant creatures that are cloned??? or give birth??? and much more stupid humans using giant robots to wrestle them""... and then he goes on to give some options and ask why it was done this way. I'll tell you why, original poster, because it is one way to get alien invaders, giant cloned creatures, and giant robots all into the same movie. This - and all big budget action pictures made today - are not about American audiences. They are about overseas audiences, where 75% of the money is made. Specifically, China and Russia. Thus you have minimal dialogue, big explosions, buxom scantily clad females, and muscular macho men who look like they came straight out of a porn movie with break-away clothing.How minimal is the dialogue? Well my husband watched this with one earphone on so he could hear the film, and one off so he could listen to me parodying the dialogue MST3K style by what I thought was going on just by the muted overacting. He stopped the film and took off the other headphone after awhile and said - ""to not be hearing anything that's being said you are remarkably spot on"". And this is exactly what the filmmakers are going for - something that you do not need to be an English speaker to follow.I did watch it later with dialogue or else I would not be able to write this review in good faith. I'm giving this a three just based on the work done on the sets. After all, production values wise, this is not an Ed Wood production. I shall now prepare to be pelted by eggs and tomatoes, most of them, I assume, coming from Russia and China.","

There's  just so much to talk about, I don't know where to begin...but let's  just get this out of the way...  PACIFIC RIM IS A 5 OUT OF FREAKIN' 5.  Guillermo Del Toro, you deserve a standing ovation. From an unbiased,  stand-alone movie point of view, this film does an incredible job of  being exciting from beginning to end, while still developing an awesome  back story and character depth.   Charlie Hunnan (of Sons of Anarchy fame) solidifies himself as a good,  respectable action movie star, but Idris Elba CRUSHES his role, and  steals every scene he's in. Solid acting all-around, much better than  what you might expect from an action movie like this.   THE ACTION IS TOP-OF-THE-LINE. What is there to compare this  to...Transformers? Transformers WISHES IT COULD HOLD A CANDLE TO  PACIFIC RIM WHEN IT COMES TO EPIC-CGI-ACTION SEQUENCES. Every hit,  every explosion, every gut-wrenching Kaiju kill is a work of art. A new  gold standard has been set.  VISUALS AND GRAPHICS ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD. THIS MOVIE DESERVES THE  IMAX 3D TREATMENT. THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE PART OF YOUR BLU-RAY  COLLECTION. THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE VIEWED ON 9 BIG-SCREEN TVS  STACKED ON YOUR LIVING ROOM WALL. Do not cheat yourself by simply doing  2D on this one.   OK, now the nerd-out part of this review. If you are a nerd in any way,  shape or form, then this movie is for you. And if you're an anime nerd,  then this is your favorite movie ever. EVER.  The inspirations from and references to Godzilla are obvious, but  you're very likely to notice influences from several different sources.  Anime fan? Then I dare you to not see the nods to Big O, Neon Genesis  Evangelion, Gundam, or even Gurren Lagaan. That female computer voice  sound familiar? Maybe that's because it's the voice actress of GLaDoS,  from the motherf*cking Portal games. Your inner nerd won't know what to  freak out over more.  5 out of 5, gold star, thumbs up, A++, 100%, NOW STOP READING THIS AND  GO SEE IT!!!","

"sdgnz","27 July 2013","This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Sure it has crazy creatures battling it out in the oceans which is just fine with me but so many elements just let the movie down. It could have been so much more.Why did the drivers of the Jaegers need to actually be in the Jaeger at all? and why are the controls linked to massive mechanical devices, surely this would be electronic. And the head is fired onto the Jaeger via some massively complicated lift type procedure? Yet they can clearly just get out the head when needed?It took 8 days of tanks and planes to take down a Kaiji but one shot into the eye from an auzi clearly causes it some distress? ONE SHOT? The oceans are about 4 stories deep, which seems to change or the size of the Jaegers adjusts during the movie.What's with every bit of steel needing to be rusty except for Ron Perlman's shoes? and massive bulkhead doors being used for the living compartments.The acting, sooooo bad.Let's send the helicopters to go and pick-up the two survivors, but lets send 20 helicopters, that makes much more sense, especially since this is a military program that has been shut down so ready access to dozens of helicopters becomes easier.They can build Jaegers with some sort of amazing sword device that comes out of nowhere but forget to tell the drivers? Charlie and the professor, just random cast choices there!It's set in the future, some things are hi-tech others are retro rusty junk, it doesn't make any sense.There's just so much more. How this movie gets a 7.8 is beyond me. Don't waste you life and avoid at all costs.","

"melcher-2001","13 July 2013","I was drawn to this film with a bit of apprehension, based on the trailers and the thought of sitting through one more predictable Hollywood summer sci-fi blockbuster. It was Guillermo del Toro's previous work that got me over the threshold (Cronos, Pan's Labyrinth). What I got was a feast for the eyes and ears that draws from inspiration from virtually every popular international genre, from Hong Kong martial arts movies to Gothic horror and Japanese Anime and then adds the unique sensibilities of a director with a unique vision who knows how to bring it across in a BIG way. He knows how to stretch our credibility beyond the limits and make it work using a great cast of character actors adding to the strong chemistry between his three leads, Hunnam, Elba and Rinko Kikuchi (in a very strong performance). Remember all those Japanese monster pictures where huge beasts come out of the sea and smash up Tokyo? Remember ""Cloverfield?"" (this movie explains that one) Roll all of these up with today's effects and Guillermo del Toro's weird design sensibility and then tell yourself, ""Let's take this one TOTALLY over the top"" and you've got ""Pacific Rim."" As an action flick, from the first shot it never stops or even slows down. The scenes with the little girl in Hong Kong (i think) are particularly chilling and uniquely part of del Toro's signature - (he understands children and terror). This film makes ""The Avengers"" look sedate.Besides being an extremely entertaining, good old fashioned monster flick, ""Pacific Rim"" is a tribute to the strength of international cinema, involving artists and production teams from every part of the globe. I imagine this will be a HUGE international hit.","

"tinjo23","11 July 2013","I was so excited to finally see Pacific Rim. An ambitious idea, carried with big-budget effects, brought to you by master director Guillermo del Toro. I was pumped. I was hoping for brilliance, something to truly give other blockbusters a run for their money. The result, as I had to expect, was not that of a game changing event. Instead, it was more or less, directly in between Greatness and Disappointment. There's a lot to love about Pacific Rim, but where it suffers seems to be mostly through a lack of confidence in it's own premise.Like last years Les Miserables, Rim makes the unfortunate error of trying to fit in 3-4 hours worth of storytelling into just over 2. Which is unfortunate considering Pacific Rim's all round story is it's strongest element. Though taken from many sources, (and by no means, anything that original) it shapes a very well-throughout premise with detail and conviction. In it's execution of this however, is where the film stumbles. Mainly, the plot feels rushed. Condensing years of devastation and development, into one short montage (the first five minutes of the film covers the entire ark which Pacific Rim is built on: the first encounters of the Kaiju, the initial attempts to stop them and finally, the culmination of the Jaguar program) which contains enough story to fill an entire other movie. The intro then concludes with the untimely destruction of one of, what seemed to be, the human race's final salvation. From there is where the movie actually begins. Now while that's an interesting (somewhat ballsy) approach, this structure causes Rim to feel much smaller in scope than what it actually is. This story is HUGE as a concept and it should have translated that way. Unfortunately what is shown is both giant in scale and unjustly short. The film is set over a small amount of time, considering the attacks have been going on for years and though it covers many key events in the Kaiju war, it never really feels like you've been delivered the full picture.Now, on the positive side, if you focus your attention to what is on display, Pacific Rim excels. It flows with both confidence and conviction. Expecting a lot from the maker of Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 2, del Toro delivers with a lot of what made him great (even if you're mostly getting del Toro, the action director). The design of both Jeagar and Kaiju are brutal and majestic. The world in which Rim exists is one where any previous del Toro film could fit in with comfortably. Beautiful design. As well as that, being this is del Toro's first real entry into mega blockbuster territory (Hellboy 2 was big, but nothing close to this) there was initial concerns that maybe he would be out of his depths in bringing the all-out-brawls to the big screen. Luckily, he delivers there too.The Jaguar vs. Kaiju assaults are stellar, even if they're not the defining assault on your senses you were hoping for. When the standoffs begin, you are returned to your childhood, reminded of why you loved seeing things go bomb in the first place. It's big, it's exciting, it's unpredictable (well, some what) and it's just so must fun. Delivered, also, with a sense of peril for the characters, which is arguably the most important thing when creating great action. Which, for that, requires a group of characters to which you need to feel like giving a damn about.Though things have been said about the people of Rim, I found them to be well-rounded and developed. Though not reaching the arks of previous big-screen franchises (The Avengers, The Dark Knight), everyone is given enough to go with, to at least earn the right for us to care about them. The standout being Mako Mori played by Rinko Kikuchi who holds the stand-out scene of the movie, when she first steps foot inside the cockpit and co-pilots the Gypsy Danger... While on the other side of the hemisphere, Charlie Hunnam, taking leading position, brings the usual tough guy, stands-for-everything-right solider, with a delicacy that makes it feel more realistic than movie realistic. Supporting casts deliver also, with the always great Idris Elba doing well with a small role, while Charlie Day is much less annoying than what you may have previously anticipated and is convincing as the fumbling, genius scientist. And of course the always fun to watch Ron Perlman as shady, black market dealer Hannibal Chau. If you take Pacific Rim as a great action/adventure story you will find much to appreciate in it's delivery. Though, were it to have the self-confidence to deliver it's premise with more conviction and pacing, it could have been the best action film of the year. For what is on display however, there is very little to hate. Guillermo del Toro has done an exceptional job at bringing this mammoth concept to the big screen and delivering in, close to the way I had hoped. In the end, what you're left with is a great, thrilling experience that confirms that big robots fighting big monsters is actually a great idea for a movie.","

"strong-122-478885","15 June 2014","Because Pacific Rim only had the insufficient clout of its pathetic PG-13 rating, all that this ""Transformers"" rip-off movie amounted to was just director Guillermo del Toro's infantile concept of a 13-year-old boy's wet-dream.I honestly swear that after the 2nd of what seemed like an endless stream of mind-numbing battle scenes, I had developed a serious case of brain-freeze. It's true.Predictable beyond belief, Pacific Rim was a mindless mess that held absolutely no surprises, whatsoever. The most damaging aspect of this film's story was that it clearly took itself way too seriously for its own good.As far as I'm concerned this film's story was just another variation on that old, stale theme of little boys who want bigger toys.Pacific Rim may have been a colossal $190 million production, but, to me, the overall return on its dollar value amounted to no more than one percent of that sum as far as its entertainment-factor stood.When it came to all of the cookie-cutter characters who prevailed in Pacific Rim, I really resented the emphasis that was placed on a bunch of cocky, self-centered jocks who were the ones intended to save the day. And the quirky repulsiveness of research scientists, Gottlieb & Newt, actually made me cringe every time these 2 despicable twits made an appearance on screen.At an overlong 2 hours and 10 minutes, Pacific Rim could've easily been edited down to 90 minutes and, believe me, in the long run, it wouldn't have made even the slightest difference to the final outcome of its truly nonsensical story.","

"Michael_Elliott","12 July 2013","Pacific Rim (2013) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Guillermo del Toro's latest is a grand throwback to the days when Godzilla and other large monsters stalked the screens. Set in the future, the Earth comes under attack by giant sea monsters so they create giant robots controlled by two pilots so that they can be destroyed. It doesn't take long for the monsters to recapture the upper hand and as time on Earth is running out the humans must come up with a new plan of attack. PACIFIC RIM isn't a masterpiece but it's about as good as a film like this can get. While there are a couple flaws to be found along the way, there's still no way to deny that this here is pure entertainment from start to finish. Obviously del Toro knows his genre so fans will see all sorts of winks to earlier movies but the director takes it to the next level and really delivers something that is a lot of fun and full of wonderful action. I'm one who usually speaks against CGI not because of the technique but because so many directors don't know how to properly use it. That's certainly not the case here because the monsters, the robots and the broken down and destroyed cities all look real. This here is very important because it allows one to really connect with everything that's going on on the screen. Another major plus here is that the action scenes are full of wonderful imagination. The battle sequences are usually long, very destructive and oh so much fun and this includes a rather amazing sequence at the end that's underwater. The performances are also quite good with Charlie Hunnam, Diego Klattenhoff and especially Idris Elba all fitting their roles nicely. Ron Perlman also has a nice supporting bit. As I said, I think there were a couple flaws with one being the running time, which I felt was a bit too long as ten or fifteen-minutes off would have helped things. There were also a few too many shots that were extremely close to the action to the point where you can't get the full view of all the destruction going on. Still, PACIFIC RIM is a great throwback to the early monster films and it's fun from the word go.","

"Field78","9 August 2013","Let me start this review by voicing my genuine surprise: why in the world has this movie been so well received? I know that *I* liked it, but I am not afraid to admit that I also liked the Transformers movies, the first Alien vs. Predator, The Grudge, and (here goes) the Star Wars prequels. I can't shake the feeling that if they had called this movie 'Transformers 4', nobody would have noticed the difference. As always, critics would have universally panned it for its over-reliance on big, ear-deafening action scenes, and the majority of moviegoers would have blasted it on every review site, yet somehow earning it over a 100 million dollar in box office anyway. I can only guess that the name 'Guillermo del Toro', creator of such visual treats as Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy, made people let go of their Michael Bay-evoked preconceptions, and enjoy it for the fun it surely delivers. Just like the addition of 'Directed by Quentin Tarantino' can change something from ""excessively dialogue-ridden dud"" to ""wonderfully inspired B-movie homage"".It is funny how many people praised the gigantic CGI-battles in this movie, where they would normally balk at such spectacles as looking fake, excessively drawn-out and so fast it is impossible to follow. Although the 3D didn't make it more comprehensible for me, it did make for some awesome sequences. Nothing we haven't seen before, though: if you know Transformers, Cloverfield, Godzilla and Independence Day, you can pretty much see where they assembled it from. 'Original', as overly stated in some reviews, is therefore not my word of choice.But, let's be fair: the influence of del Toro does manifest itself on a few occasions. More care seems to have been taken for some of the main characters than is usual in a multi-million dollar blockbuster. Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi get some nice background and motivation for getting inside a big robot and beating the hell out of a group of monsters. But that's about as developed as the characters get. If you've ever seen a recent blockbuster disaster movie, the rest can be easily classified: the loud-mouthed annoying bully who gets to redeem himself; the black man who gets to sacrifice himself (fortunately, he was already terminally ill); the anonymous cannon fodder, and so on.I love a good bit of comic relief, but the two 'funny scientists' in the movie made me cringe worse than John Malkovich, Ken Yeong and John Turturro did combined in Transformers 3. Fortunately, there's Ron Perlman, del Toro's secret weapon, to show that you don't need to overact hysterically in order to be funny (watch out for the scene during the credits!) The addition that a Yaeger must be operated by two symbiotically-linked people is a particularly nice touch. So, with such a spark of inspiration, you'd wonder why del Toro would make do with a screenplay that has holes large enough to accommodate the entire Yaeger battalion. I almost found myself yelling such phrases as ""why the hell didn't you use that sword three battles ago, saving precious lives and dollars?!"" and ""wow, a Kaiju with an EMP, what a convenient plot device just when the story calls for some drama!"" And how can two escape pods get through that Breach without a Kaiju attached to them? I am eagerly awaiting the ""How it should have ended"" video for this most blatant disregard for internal logic since they built a second Death Star with another obvious design flaw. What I won't deny is that Pacific Rim is good fun. In fact, if it was del Toro's intention to make an homage to B-monster movies complete with all its genre flaws and conventions, he has succeeded gloriously. Halfway, I simply shut down my brain and enjoyed, and afterwards, I had a good laugh with the other moviegoers over the many silly things we witnessed. All in all, this is not the presumed masterpiece it is generally taken for, but a typical summer movie I enjoyed for its sheer spectacle and goofiness; I simply did not expect the main audience to embrace it so easily.","

"johnnymacbest","27 July 2013","One of the best films I've seen this year. A unique blend of Japanese mecha and kaiju that pays homage to those films, Pacific Rim is a film that not only dazzles the senses, but it's also a human story at heart and that's the most important part of any film that has the fate of the world hanging in the balance with epic battles at the forefront. I found this film MUCH BETTER than the Transformers films. Though those films had epic action scenes, the big difference is that you can ACTUALLY see the action; no quick-style-MTV-ADD-riddled editing. The action flows organically along with the story, which is both exciting, fresh, and well-acted. Some of the characters were underdeveloped, but the leads are impressive with great performances throughout.Pacific Rim is one of those films that simply make you say, WOW!!! A really fun time at the movies and a nice change of pace from the gritty blockbusters in theaters now. I hope they get a sequel going because I'm really excited to see what their gonna come up with next.","

"krisnadexter","22 February 2022","Watching this movie revives the kid in me. When I really enjoy watching Ultraman, Power Rangers, Kamen Rider Series etc. This movie takes it to a whole other level. It's grandiose!!!I get why people don't give this movie high rating. Because the story is quite simple and straight forward. Giant monsters are attacking earth. Now we build giant robots to fight against them. With some drama sprinkled around the mighty action.While the writing is questionable, the action is the best. You wont bother for some medium level acting, plotholes, or underdeveloped character if you saw the fight here. The monsters are truly massive. The way they move and sound are terrifying. The robots (or the Jaeger in the movie) fight impressively. And to be honest, The Cancelling Apocalypse speech is one of the best speech I've ever heard in movie.This movie is something you should see in big screen and good sound system. Truly amazing.","

"kosmasp","31 August 2013","I was surprised that this movie didn't do well at the Box Office. Not only because it is done by Del Toro, but mainly because it is really good. And it seems people like it generally too (see rating here on IMDb, currently ranking at 7.6). So why didn't it perform? Tough to say, but seems like people didn't want to watch it at that time, so maybe the release date was off.You can't tell with those things though, so I'm pretty sure this will do much better once it hits the video stores/markets and sells/rents like crazy. The movie deserves that. And not because it is a great movie, but because it is very entertaining. Predictable and filled with clichÃ©s, Idris Elbas performance alone is worth the money! Sit back, relax and enjoy the show","

But this is what kids now spend their allowance on??Too many things to comment on, but among them are: how can only 8 helicopters lift one of these robots, when they weigh 2500 tons? Why don't the kaiju's attack en masse, rather than just one or two at a time? Why can't the robots be controlled remotely, rather than risking the lives of 'pilots'? Why not simply shoot a missile (using all those helicopters) down the kaiju's throat when it inevitably opens up to make a loud roar?","

"dcobbimdb","16 November 2013","When I see a movie I want to be entertained, that's it. Obviously it depends upon the material and type of movie, but lets get down to it, when you're going to see a good ol action flick, you just want to be entertained, see some good explosions and cool stuff and the goal is won.Now this movie? I've seen a lot of negative reviews and such and I'm struggling to find out where all the negativity stems from. Yes there are no famous characters in this flick, but it had a good story, good timing, awesome special effects and a great ending. BOOM!!! For the naysayers who say ""It's shallow"", or whatever, frak them... This movie is great and I think they are just defending something else that didn't quite make it. I didn't see this in the theaters and wish I had given it's monstrosity far as ""big picture appeal"" and it makes sense given the material. If you're at all in to Sci-Fi flicks, robots, aliens or any one of the three you'll probably love this like I did. Giving it 10 / 10 which I rarely do, somewhat because of the negativity stream, which again I simply do not understand, but this movie is a solid movie for what it is...See it on as big of screen and with the best of sound you have available!","

The best part is in middle of film having emotional feelings and don't want to spoil it. it is a true cinematic experience especially in 3d .and to watch it in home TV screens will be disgrace to this movie.Hope the Sequel or Warner Bros next projects show much more improvement.really anxious to watch movies like these in future","

"Rickting","30 November 2014","Robots hit monsters. Am I meant to care? Guillermo del Toro's latest project involves humans controlling enormous robots and beating up Godzilla style monsters emerging from the ocean. It's very satisfying that this didn't actually do that well in America, because this is just total formula. We don't need movies like this. We've seen it all before. This action garbage has silver linings here and there. Visually, it's interesting and has plenty of awesome imagery. It's got a strong colour palette. Del Toro's direction is merely acceptable, but there is a sense of wonder in the movie, and the CGI genuinely looks great. In terms of style and visuals, the movie is quite strong and not everything can be deep and meaningful. Many will enjoy this, especially if they see it on a big screen. Pacific Rim frequently feels like a loving tribute to its genre and for some it will be a dream come true. At least it's a bit lighter and less serious than some other blockbusters these days. For some this could be a good antidote to Man Of Steel.I saw this on the small screen so maybe I'm biased. The thing which lets PR down is that it's not just robots hitting monsters. There is an hour between the first and second big robot battles and the film has the cheek to try and emotionally engage us with these pathetic, one dimensional characters. Seriously? The film may look great, but it's so cartoony and flat (While pretending it isn't flat by shoving loads of meaningless backstory down our throats) it's could have been some awful 2 hour cartoon on CBBC. The acting is pretty bad and even Idris Elba isn't that good. The movie just isn't original and since it's actually pretty boring much of the time (I don't care about what happened to the female protagonist when she was a kid!). Del Toro, who also made Pan's Labyrinth, another very overpraised film, is clearly popular because he's a bit different. Difference in modern films is a great things but there's only so long I can look at creatures, dark fantasy and loads of boring weirdness before I give up and watch Godzilla instead.4/10","

"land-840-861366","27 November 2013","Unlike some, I had no problem with the high concept of the piece: Transformers vs Godzilla. It had a lot of potential. And when the movie concentrates on what we are all here to see (giant creatures and robots beating on each others with oil tankers and smashing through skyscrapers) it is very successful. But when things get quiet... less so. Too much time spent on ""Top Gun"" like fighter pilot shenanigans. Not enough nuance in the characterizations. An ultra linear plot with few attempts to confound expectations. The acting isn't bad - and isn't required to be great in this sort of film - but it is nothing special either. Sort of universally ""meh"". Good for a Blu Ray rental.","

"Ric-7","30 July 2013","I will keep this short: I was so surprised. I went expecting a cut above the usual action movie, but I was amazed at how terrific this was. The screen play seems to be a collection of virtually every war movie and monster movie clichÃ© imaginable--all of which is obviously intended. It's like an intelligent and witty Transformers film, if you can imagine. The film does not try to be trendy and it avoids witty dialog, TG. The stock characters are given stock lines to say, and they do it perfectly. For example, the eve-of-battle speech.At first I was wondering if the director knew that the film was just one clichÃ©, in-joke or film reference after another. There was no doubt that he knew, after I saw the ""Coolant Low"" warning.The 3-D and IMAX were distracting. When (not if) I see it again, it will be in 2-D, which is at least one dimension more than most summer action films lately.","

"Jeremy_Urquhart","18 July 2013","I was giving up on the idea of ever looking forward to another big Hollywood summer movie ever again, but then Pacific Rim comes along with its charmingly simple plot, incredible special effects, an almost perfect tone, 3D that didn't destroy my eyes or make everything look dark and blurry, and, most importantly of all, a sense of fun. I felt happy and alive coming out of the theatre, and for once I felt as though not a cent had been wasted on my ridiculously expensive movie ticket. This is one you should all go and check out. Need more reasons to do so? Okay, here we go...Guillermo Del Toro. This guy knows how to make a movie. Pan's Labyrinth is an absolutely amazing film, and one of my all time favourites. Hellboy 1 was decent in my opinion, but the sequel I thought was really good. Pacific Rim I like a little more than the Hellboy films, but it's definitely not quite up there with Pan's Labyrinth. It lacks the emotion and the artistry of that film, but it's still a great movie, just in a different way. This movie is visually astonishing in almost every regard, and I think Del Toro himself can largely be thanked for that. The action scenes feature CGI so good you won't even feel like complaining about it, and are constructed in a coherent, satisfying manner. There's no irritating shaky-cam here, and thankfully the movie doesn't skimp on the violence either- no humans die graphic deaths of course, but a number of giant monsters get absolutely pummelled and ripped to shreds by the robots, and it's satisfying as hell to see this happen.Keeps the plot simple. There's no overly convoluted villain motivations, no absurd and annoying twists in the story, and no characters that are too complicated for their own good. This movie features giant monsters that want to take over Earth, and this causes the humans to build giant, controllable robots to fight the monsters. That's your plot. There are characters, and while they're almost all archetypal, the movie's aware of this, and somehow this makes it okay. We get enough character development to at least care for these people. This movie uses very traditional, standard characters in a way that's somehow not bothersome. The actors are all serviceable too, with Idris Elba probably coming the closest to standing out. So the dialogue, characters, and acting are all, for the most part, merely serviceable, but they really don't need to be anything more in this movie. The characters remain consistent, and aren't irritating (not even the comic relief scientist characters), and for me that was all they needed to be in a film like this.Crazy scale: The monsters and robots in this movie are absolutely gigantic, and this makes the fight scenes awe-inspiring. These are creatures that are literally the size of sky-scrapers, and there's something crazily entertaining about seeing such huge things do battle together. There's a real weight to the fight scenes as well- the booming sound and convincing CGI really makes you feel every single punch. It's all very forceful, intense, visceral, and convincing. And yeah, as mentioned before, the sheer scale of the movie never stops being impressive. You know these things are big when one robot wields a cargo ship and uses it as a melee weapon.The movie is actually fun: Not all movies have to be fun and entertaining. Hell, a lot of my favourite movies aren't particularly fun to watch (Requiem for a Dream anyone?), yet they might be really engaging at both an emotional and intellectual level, or they may provoke strong physical reactions do to the way they're constructed.. Big Hollywood blockbusters, however, should be fun. They shouldn't all try to be so ""deep"" and ""thought-provoking."" Big action scenes and personal character drama just don't really mix too well- maybe Christopher Nolan can pull it off, but he's the exception in this case. Leave the deep stuff to the independent and foreign film-makers. Big movies like Pacific Rim should just be a blast to watch, and, thankfully, Pacific Rim is an absolute blast to watch. It never stops being entertaining- I was giggling in glee throughout almost the entire film, and I left the theatre feeling almost euphoric. Yeah, I had a great time. And even better, the movie feels like it was made by people who were having fun as well. It's nice to watch a movie and get the sense that the people who worked on it enjoyed doing so. Maybe in reality they didn't, but it certainly doesn't feel like that based solely on just watching the movie they ended up making.So should you see this one? Yes. Definitely yes. Especially if you've come out of more than one big blockbuster film this year feeling like you haven't really enjoyed yourself. Pacific Rim is explosive, silly, and completely over-the-top, but the film-makers were aware of this, and as a result just had fun with the whole thing; you find yourself laughing with the film rather than at the film. It's a gleeful, somewhat tongue-in-cheek film that just wants to entertain its audience.According to the ever reliable Wikipedia, Del Toro envisioned Pacific Rim as an earnest, colourful adventure story, with an ""incredibly airy and light feel"", in contrast to the ""super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie"". If this was indeed the case, he couldn't have succeeded more.","

"griffolyon12","12 July 2013","As a kid growing up, a lot of the times during the Summer I would get bored with no one else around to hang out with. I mean, what else does a film obsessed kid do when he's bored in the Summer? Well, he makes a movie of course. However, what type of movies? There were no other kids around in my neighborhood to use as actors, so I made monster movies. Some of the times these movies starred our cat, but seeing as how living creatures were more difficult to work with, most of my monster movies starred a marionette creature or stuffed animals, with action figures playing the human roles. There were no scripts, just my imagination literally making everything up as I went along with our Hi-8 video camera in tow. All of this to say, I've always loved monster movies, and Pacific Rim may just be one of the best, if not the most original monster movies ever made.What makes Pacific Rim so original is that it mashes up two Japanese film genres, those of the giant monster and the giant robot, and creates a movie that is unlike anything that Western audiences have ever seen before. Pitting giant robots versus giant monsters was a genius idea that I wish I had come up with, and screenwriter Travis Beacham deserves huge kudos for coming up with the idea. The thing is though, this film wouldn't be worth watching if it didn't manage to have more going for it than just giant robots and giant monsters. Beacham and director Guillermo Del Toro go beyond that simple idea and actually have created likable characters and an involving story to go along with the awesome spectacle, and that's why Pacific Rim should be considered one of the best monster movies ever made.If you've ever seen any Godzilla movie or episode of Japanese animation (i.e. anime) featuring giant robots, then you will recognize all of the character types that exist in this movie. Pacific Rim is really like anime brought to life in live action, and if this movie can achieve such believable results, then can a live action Mobile Suit Gundam movie be far behind? One can only hope, but for right now, as a fan of anime and Japanese entertainment, Pacific Rim manages to introduce American audiences to all of the Japanese film and anime tropes that many of the kids in my generation have been in love with for our entire lives. However, I don't want anyone reading this who has never seen any anime or previous monster movies to think that this movie is not for them.Pacific Rim is really a movie for anyone who just loves a good time at the movies. It's fun, action packed, and is emotionally involving. Unlike so many Summer blockbusters that take themselves too seriously, Pacific Rim manages to balance the humor with the seriousness to create a lighthearted adventure film that still carries weight and consequence through the character's actions, but you're having a blast while the world is literally on the brink of destruction. Guillermo Del Toro treats this film as if it's like a propaganda film from the WWII days, where he's idolizing the pilots of these giant robots, trying to inspire humanity with hope and optimism to actually rise up and meet the monsters rather than getting crushed under their feet. Of course, I'll reiterate this point, had the characters not have worked, neither would have this movie. The characters and their relationships with one another are what gives this movie dramatic heft when it most matters, to where when we reach the action, it's not just mayhem for the sake of mayhem, it actually means something.In case you haven't noticed, I loved Pacific Rim. Few movies are this imaginative and this much fun, and that's the main thing to take away from this movie. From a design standpoint, this is one of the more meticulously crafted made up worlds I've seen in recent years, and that is a testament to Del Toro's gifted cinematic eye. The action is stand up and cheer awesome, thanks to amazing FX work from Industrial Light and Magic. As for the characters, none of them would work if the actors playing them weren't so likable, from Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, and Charlie Day, to the emotionally vulnerable performance from Rinko Kikuchi, they're the ones that actually make us care about the story. Bottom line, this isn't another Summer blockbuster trying to play off of post-9/11 fears and anxieties, it's literally a movie about the goodness of humanity and the power of the human spirit to work together when it's most needed, and who doesn't want to see that?I give Pacific Rim a 9 out of 10!","

"Sleepin_Dragon","2 August 2018","Having been told I had to go and see the new one I thought I'd better catch up on the original, to know what is going on at least. Having watched it that clarity isn't exactly clear, as I didn't know what was going on. If I'm honest I didn't care much, as plot wasn't exactly the focus, it certainly was action packed, didn't drag, and very much started off as it continued.It's of course intensely over the top, I expected the man made robots to be high fiving and woop wooing as they took down the monsters, what do you expect?Some fun performances, some dodgy ones, I'll let you decide on which is which. Luther himself looked totally out of place, in a role he obviously did for the cash, Elba did nothing here to enhance his acting credibility, but his charisma is obvious.Like I say it's a pile of pants, it's uber trashy, but somehow it's an exciting sci fi romp. 6/10","

"jhpstrydom","29 November 2013","Before watching PACIFIC RIM I noticed it had a lot of critics really hammered down on it and truth be told it really wasn't that bad. Then again I stopped listening to critics a long time ago. Although many would agree it could be somewhat overblown with special effects but it did have a decent plot. The acting wasn't the best but also not the worst. All the effects were very nicely done and the fight sequences were very engaging partly because the film established what was at stake before them.All in all, PACIFIC RIM isn't as bad as critics say it is in fact I think they might have been too harsh. The best way to see PACIFIC RIM is probably without expecting to much and to judge for yourself if you like it or not. For me it was good and better than expected and I would recommend it as a better alternative to a lot of other films out there.","

"foreverknight47","1 September 2013","As Marvin the Paranoid Android might say ""I saw it. It was AWFUL"".Nothing about this mess hangs together. These huge monsters rise so the obvious thing to do is construct giant robots to go Mano-a-Mano with them? Not drop a nuke on them? Come on.When that starts to fail you build a huge wall that looks fab at the beginning of the film but then is never mentioned again, aside from the fact no wall would stop a monster climbing it? They're 250 feet tall!What we have here is a 10 year old boy with ADHD crashing his Godzilla model and his Transformers together for TWO FREAKING HOURS! Crash! Crash! Crash! Take that, Godzilla! CRASH! Wham! Etc.There is not a single clichÃ©-free relationship in this film and, if the robots are made of steel, the characters are made of cardboard. In fact. the Jaegers have more personality than the actors, which isn't saying much, and the whole experience is like a huge sugar and popcorn rush in a kiddies matinÃ©e.I can't believe this cynical pile of Kaiju excrement came from the director of PAN'S LABYRINTH or the HELLBOY films.","

I was under the impression it was going to be a lot of CGI robots and monsters bashing each other, which I really have no interest in. There is still some of that, but director Guillermo Del Toro made sure that things went a bit deeper than that, with some decent human characters.Really, the casting is to be praised. Del Toro regular Ron Perlman plays one of his best characters yet, and the choice of Charlie Day as a scientist was brilliant. I wasn't sure if he'd be the right sort of person for the story, but he was beyond perfect... that Charlie humor we love, with just a twinge of madness.","

"alucard_castlevania86","12 July 2013","Awesome film. Definitely in my top 5 favorite movies of the year. The story as usual was very predictable but it was the awesome action and stunning visual graphics that really made this film work. Mr. Del Toro also does a great job in keeping this movie as family friendlyThe Jaegers however were one of my main concerns. There were not many involved there and it too much was focused on the 'Gipsy Danger' Storywise although simple and straight forward, there might some things in the story that are kind of hard to understand but again this is the kind of movie where action is more important. However, I think people will quickly get bored with this movie after a whileThe acting form Charlie Hunnam, Idris Alba, Rinko Kikiuchi as well as the rest of the cast was pretty solid and it was great to see Ron Perlman in another Del Toro film without his Hellboy costume this time. My 1 and only complain would be there were no Pacific Rim merchandise like popcorn boxes or drinks since it would have been an awesome addition to my current collection. Oh well, can't have it all my way Overall for Pacific Rim was an enjoyable ride and a must see film especially to all of you Mech fans out there","

"themissingpatient","31 October 2013","We are told, through a horribly done voice-over, that monsters, known as Kaiju, rose from the sea. To fight them the world used all of it's natural resources to build giant robots, known as Jaegers. These robots need two pilots who are, what is called, drift compatible. After losing his twin brother and co-pilot, the narrator and main character must prepare to get back into battle before the war is lost.This is one of the most terribly written screenplays, with absolute pathetic attempts at acting, to ever be put to the big screen. This makes Transformers: Dark Of The Moon seem like an epic masterpiece. This is storytelling at it's laziest. For director Guillermo del Toro, this is embarrassing! This is the guy who directed Cronos, The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth. Even having his name attached to such horrible horror films as Don't Be Afraid of the Dark and Mama, he did not direct the films, so we assumed he still rocked as a director. In his defense, he did not write the screenplay.Pacific Rim, with it's big special effects and gimmicks, will be a favorite amongst males under the age of 14 until the next big monster movie is released.","

All there is, is a big pile of CGI and a script that looks like it was written by a four year old.There is LOTS of cgi. Its not very good CGI and it completely fails to disguise the fact that the movie is idiotic and lazy, with nothing to offer anyone except the completely undiscerning viewer. The film even has much of the action taking place in poorly lit environments to attempt to describe the lameness of the effects.

"XweAponX","31 January 2014","I Love Guillermo Del Toro. the man has a twisted imagination, he makes some very incredibly scary Monsters. From Mimic to Hellboy II and Pan's Labyrinth, he's been scaring the Bejeezus out of us for over a decade. And we keep coming back for more.He even had a small hand in the creation of Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" - And in a way I am glad that Guillermo did not direct that, as he said that making Pan's Labyrinth almost killed him, I think The Hobbit would have been too much for him.But Pacific Rim was not - And he did it, Del Toro did a GOOD JOB on Pacific Rim.I think what people do not realize is how much of himself Guillermo Del Toro puts into his movies. A Lot of work, and a Lot of Love.So when I first heard of this movie a few years ago, I was not sure I understood what it was to be about - And I was correct, you cannot easily quantify what kind of Movie Pacific Rim is. Is it a Monster Movie? Yes. Is it a movie about Giant Monsters? Yes. Is it like Robot Jox? YES.So what we get is a cross between Robot Jox and Robotech - Men Piloting Huge Mechanical Robots, which are Man's Only Tools to fight an enemy which puts man on the scale of an Insect under these enemies' Boots- Er, Claws, Er, Appendages.And so we get to see the level of destruction from the first frame of this film, and not only the use of Huge Robots, but we are told about ""The Drift"" - Two Minds merged together through the Machine, two men working as one, Is this a Love Story? In all ways, this is a Love story between Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) and Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam). But it is also a love story between Raleigh and his late brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) - And also between Mako and her Surrogate Father Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba). And between the Father/Son Team of Herc Hansen (Max Martini) and Chuck Hansen (Robert Kazinsky) - And finally even love between the oddest of odd couples ever: Doctors Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and ""Gottleib"" (Burn Gorman).Why? Because all of these people have shared ""The Drift"" in some form or another.""The Drift"" is not only a technical solution which allows two Pilots to Merge into basically a single Brain, Left and Right hemispheres, for Piloting a Jaeger - It's also a Gimmick created by Guillermo Del Toro to help us understand the relationships between these people.And this gimmick works better for that than strictly as a means for two Pilots to drive a Jaeger.Through this Gimmick, we understand Raleigh's loss of Yancy. We understand the antagonism of the two ""Scientists"" Gottlieb and Geiszler, antagonism peppered with healthy respect. We understand Pentecost's protectiveness over Mako, as we see through her eyes how she perceived her Savior Pentecost when she sees him for the first time as a little girl holding one red shoe.It is Pentecost's Final Words to Mako which has a bittersweet ring to it: ""You can Always Find me, In the drift"".And when he says this, we KNOW, that he is not going to be dead, that he will always be there in Mako's Mind each time she relives that moment where she sees her Knight in Shining Armor arise from the Cockpit of a Jaeger.It is not just the digital imagery used to portray men fighting huge monsters, Digital Imagery which succeeds rather than fails on all kinds of levels - But it is the Imagery Guillermo has created- This WORLD he created and has given to us, to either live in, and enjoy with him, or to not bother- This fantastic Future Landscape which holds enough Future Shock to kill 1,000 Alvin Toffler's - THIS is what has been given to us with these images- And the way the Digital Images are blended with the practical Film effects, so we do not know where one ends and the other begins.In fact, one documentary I had read from, describes that the Kaijus were designed as if they were to be like the suits worn by Men in old Godzilla Movies- And in fact the way the Kaijus Move are very much like ""Men in Suits"" - Only that I have heard Guillermo talking about creating large monsters in other films, particularly in Hellboy - that he animated the ""Sammael"" daemons so that the movements were more like Animal Movements- He did MUCH the same here with the Kaiju Movements. But I am glad I bothered to watch this film - It has taken me a whole month to think about how I would write this review. It is because of the deep Humanity which this story shows us, love and respect, that I choose to respect it's director for.Because on top of all of these deep Human and Spiritual aspects of this story, Guillermo has given us a nonstop event filled with action, and when the Pilots get into their Jaegers, we get into the cockpit alongside them. And when Raleigh falls into the Rift with the carcass of the first Category-Five Kaiju, we fall down that rabbit hole with them, and when we see the Leader of the Invading Aliens, and the FEAR in his three or four Eyes, we can REALLY see that fear, and this makes that moment much more satisfying for us as viewers and participators in the story.Guillermo Del Toro is much different than other directors of today. Even here we can see his earlier efforts as influences - And one thing I know that Guillermo always carries around is his Notebook.Thank you Guillermo, and I'm still waiting for Hellboy Three!","

"jfgibson73","13 November 2013","I didn't dislike this movie; giant robots against giant monsters is a fun idea that isn't like anything else being done right now. But the dialog needed to be smarter. I think there is more going on with the characters than I picked up from one viewing--I gotta believe Del Toro put in some layers you have to dig for. But on the surface, it comes off like some of the sillier action movies of the early 80's. Some notes for the sequel: 1. Hire a writer that speaks the language the film gets made in; 2. Get someone in there that understands color design--maybe you could sell some toys if everything wasn't all the same shade of blue-gray; 3. Don't bother having the giant robots throw the giant monsters when they're fighting in water. It doesn't hurt. Show more damage. It's cool when body parts break off. Kthnx, j.g.","

"ssallazzar","14 July 2013","I don't know what other movie people saw, but I for one I'm not impressed by some special effects anymore . Got to see this movie with some friends and based on the reviews I saw on this website we thought it would be fun .The movie started OKs first 20 min they build it up nice , then could have skipped the next hour, utterly pointless , the story predictable, full of clichÃ© lines and just a waste of time, and I don't know what was wrong with the girl playing the ""love interest"" but when she was attempting to cry or give some longing look i started laughing and when they tried to make a funny scene you could see it miles away and i wanted to cry how awful the script was. And Charlie, I like him in SoA but he didn't have to go to that much trouble to play Jax in this movie as well .Well the action scenes we're OK I suppose if your into big things.. and even those had their ""genius"" moments like the sword and its ""analogical"" ...moment , granted If the intention was to ridicule and make me laugh at the absurdity of its logic then it did its job.By the time this movie was nearing the end , I was at least hoping the director of the movie could have the decency to just kill them off, instead i got to see Jax fondling that annoying 14 year old (yea ... i know the actress is like 30+ but that doesn't change the fact that in the movie she looks and acts like 14-15).In conclusion if this what entertains people in this day , then by all means, let the monsters loose , at least we get a good show ...","

"oecobius","30 March 2014","Pacific Rim is an exercise in unoriginality. By the end, I desperately hoped that the filmmakers had intended some cynical meta-theme about the poor state of Hollywood films today, but I gave up hope upon reading the pretentious boasts by Del Toro and his cronies who apparently took this boring popcorn flick dead seriously.The plot is paper thin and not very interesting, mainly because the film is too scared to go anywhere remotely clever or deep with its characters, message or general story. Del Toro has said the message is meant to be the simple ""we all should work together."" Even though this statement is cheesy and borderline meaningless, it could theoretically work with enough wit & creativity. Instead, all the characters are annoying stereotypes, and the film's ""message"" is conveyed in the laziest way possible. Most of the so-called ""character arcs"" are basically ""2 characters fight like whiny teens, eventually 1 of them does something helpful or useful, the other guy immediately pulls a 180 and decides they're friends."" I couldn't stand the 1-dimensional, boring characters. Even the central protagonist we spend the most time with never amounts to anything more than an annoyingly smug, whitebread hero whose ""generic action hero"" screaming voice will have you rolling your eyes throughout the 2nd half of the film. The female lead is so flat and bland that she constantly waffles between the extremes of an ""impressive talented spunky chick"" stereotype or an ""unreliable weak woman"" stereotype. Whatever the case, the filmmakers clearly thought audiences were too stupid to understand any characters who act like nuanced, 3-dimensional human beings. The lack of any worthwhile story, message or characters is a huge insult to the audience up-front.Without a decent story or characters, what else is there? The special effects are widely praised, but every time the monsters or robots were on screen, I was acutely aware I was watching a special effect. The big CGI fights are trite and predictable with no distinct personality; they're the kind of thing Hollywood has done countless times before and will bore you to tears if you're older than 12. It feels as if the effects crew made a generic CGI effects showcase and the rest of the film was written around those hackneyed action scenes!Even the soundtrack is typical & unoriginal. Most of the time you don't notice it there, but in the ""dramatic"" moments you might notice the incredibly cheesy and corny ""scary"" or ""triumphant"" cues, again completely bland and generic.There are so many elements that serve NO purpose in this movie other than to be as derivative and unoriginal as possible. For instance, the pilots feel pain when their robot gets hit. Why? This adds nothing to the plot or message, but Evangelion did it so Pacific Rim needs to steal the idea. The computer voice is distractingly Glados from the Portal video games. Why? There's no clever reason or hidden meaning; it just adds to the vibe that this film is a patchwork of borrowed ideas for one meaningless mishmash. You could no doubt write a shot-by-shot analysis of all the influences and sources this flick rips off, and I'm sure that all the original sources this film steals from would be way more entertaining and worth your while than this bloated pastiche.I won't even bother touching on the glaring plot holes and inconsistencies. The internet already has a LOT of material about the ludicrous flaws that pepper the film's already flimsy script. Personally I could forgive the countless illogical concepts surrounding the plot if it were a story worth telling, but Pacific Rim never even comes close.If you want a film with any respect for its audience, skip Pacific Rim. This film seeks only to make easy cash by giving people the same things they've seen before, except without any cleverness or depth that might make them interesting.","

"benegesserit20","6 August 2013","To sum this movie up in a few sentences, I can state the following things:The basic idea is really great. The story built on this great idea is decent but mediocre at best. The dialogues are pretty much ridiculous. The plot is bleeding from several wounds. I won't give a detailed list of them for a reason that can be described in six letters: IMAX 3DBecause boy, despite all of its flaws, the thing is as gorgeous as it can get! Beautiful, jaw-dropping, mind-blowing cool, extremely enjoyable.I probably wouldn't have liked it watching it on DVD or without 3D because when only the story remains, it's quite week. But with 3D it made me sit for two hours like a little kid, eyes sparkling.The conclusion is: lean back, put your 3D glasses on and have fun!","

"callanvass","24 December 2013","I've grown tired of summer blockbusters. I love action movies but with all the Transformer movies, comic book adaptations, among others things, it gets a bit much after a while. Pacific Rim is typically overlong but I can't deny how enjoyable it is. The middle is a bit slow at times. I thought it got a bit too talky at times, and my interest began to wane. I did love the final 40/50 minutes. The final 40/50 minutes is absolutely packed with non-stop carnage and destruction. It's loaded with CGI; don't get me wrong, it just didn't bother me. The production design is extremely impressive, and it's amazing visually. The destruction on the cities, the robots, the monsters all looked fantastic. My only problem as I explained above is that when you aren't being amazed by all of that stuff, it does tend to be a little mundane at certain points, but it has a lot more good than bad. The performances can be a little bland at times. Charlie Hunnam isn't the most exciting lead. He's OK at best. I never really got into his emotional plight. Since the movie is over two hours long, he didn't have nearly enough charisma to maintain my interest. Thankfully, the fantastic action tends to bail him out a lot of the time, but I wasn't all that impressed by him. Idris Elba is excellent as per usual. He's by far the most interesting character in this movie. His gruff, yet caring character was a blast to watch. Rinko Kikuchi is rather uninteresting as Mako. She has moments where she does good work. I just think she seemed a little uncomfortable during some of the meatier moments. Charlie Day is alternately funny and annoying as a scientist. Final Thoughts: Aside from the mediocre performances, the rather boring middle section, I thought this was well above average for a blockbuster movie. It sets out to entertain the masses. It does that extremely well. Considering I had low expectations going in, I was pleasantly surprised. It's a little overlong but if you kick your brain to the curb, sit back, relax, and enjoy the abundance of destruction7.6/10","

"D4V1D2411","26 January 2022","This is what all action movies should aspire to be. From the first 5 minutes of the movie you can understand and comprehend the world the movie presents and inmediatly caughts your attention and never lets you go. The story is very simple but the actors, especially the supporting cast, are giving everything they got to the point I can actually remembera lot of them after months without watching the movie. The fight scenes are the highlights of the film, it has only a few, like 3 I think, but these fights are some of the best out there, making you feel excited at all time. The CGI hasn't aged a bit and even stands strong despite being almost a decade old and even looks better than a lot of movies today. This movie is really a banger from minute 1 to the end and I really wish, Guillermo had directed the sequel.","

I really think it's worth watching.","

It was almost magical. I had to keep reminding myself about the bad things in real life, but then a new robot vs monster battle happened and all the sudden that didn't matter any more. Total escapism done with excellent design attention and detail. Thank you GDT. You have to be an artist and a science fiction geek to appreciate this.

"dp-brightful","9 August 2013","This was everything that a summer action film should be. Stunning graphics, a unique story line, solid plot, solid acting (though this was likely the weak point) and a very well paced movie. I found myself in sheer awe of many of the CGI scenes. They were really, really well done. Stunning in fact.This movie could have actually been a 9 or 10 with better acting and tweaks to the script. That said, this was an absolutely entertaining film that is sure to be added to my personal video library. It will be a great ""demo Blu Ray"" for any home theater enthusiast.BTW, Idris Elba was the stand out of the actors. He did an excellent job. A couple of the others were also solid, but no one rose t Idris' level. Had they hired better actors, this could have been even better.","

"Junreviews","30 July 2013","I rarely write a review by solely narrowing down significant elements that make the movie so special and stand out. But, as ""Pacific Rim"" which is subliminally forced to put in an unexpected competition for reviving childhood memories of those who grew up watching Godzilla or Transformer, when it is merely made to give us an entire new perspective about ""How to defeat Monsters if they really happen to attack earth."" So here it goes, it rocks harder than all the present monstrous movies because 1. There are detailed and logical explanations for the origin of the monsters that let you not only experience immersive and inconceivable scenes but comprehend the story without being perplexed by sloppy settings.2. Massive details on robots aka Jaegers unleashes the magnificence of their luster, mechanical textures, and operational systems that were created by stunning Visual effects and efforts of stunts.3. Again, there are tremendous details on monsters aka Kaiju that not only it looks realistic but possesses jagged skin with frightening body structure that can easily threatens even a giant 250-feet tall robot.4. The movements and actions during the battles are wonderfully depicted without shifting too fast which often results us in confusion for ""Who hits who? or How does it that happen?"" You can vividly enjoy spectacular motions that occur in both city and ocean environments along with dynamic camera angles. 5. Every character play the role with vehement passions. I agree with some of the lines and expressions being quite shallow and cheesy. However, if compared to emotional relationships and conflicts between characters that this film offers, the acting part can be forgiven as no other counterparts have as much scientific explanations and a compelling story as this one. It is so mega from the intro to the end.","

"pfgpowell-1","10 January 2014","After the intriguing Pan's Labyrinth, we were, perhaps, entitled to expect something with a little more brains from Guillermo del Toro. Well, Pacific Rim sadly isn't it. It isn't bad as blockbusters go (and I should admit I, for one, am usually underwhelmed by blockbusters, even ones which are better than this), but it falls down in areas where a film should be strong whatever genre it is and whatever demographic it serves (in the case of Pacific Rim I suspect that is 11-year-old boys).The characters struggle even to be two-dimensional, the 'plot' and it's explanation is a tad too simplistic even for a blockbuster, the dialogue is horribly predictable and the 'fight' scenes all go on just a little too long. In a way it's as though del Toro got a Build Your Own Blockbuster kit for Christmas and put it all together without really consulting the manual. I, for one, wanted to know more about the Kaju, the monsters from deep who are destroying the world. What were they? Where did they come from? Did they agree with Obamacare or did they (rather more probably given how fierce and unremitting they were to destroy all before them) incline more to the Tea Party? That kind of thing.Then there were the jaegers, the monstrously large robots humankind had developed to kill them: how come, for example, they didn't leak when under water? How were they powered? How come, what with all the technology we had at our disposal to design and build them in the first place, the best they can resort to when destroying a kaju is a heavy bout of fisticuffs and knocking six bells out of their kaju opponent? The problem with Pacific Rim is that del Toro comes up with some neat ideas, but then explores the wrong parts of them.Being a sci-fi offering, it is reasonably easy to buy into the notion that each jaeger has to be operated by two folk in tandem who have to 'share' their brains and memories. Hogwash, yes, but what they hell. But apart from telling us that that's the deal, del Toro doesn't bother developing the notion, which might well have offered fertile ground for invention. Where Pacific Rim does score is in special effects: they are very well done, though - back to griping mode - once you have seen one city obliterated by a kaju stomping through it, the wonder of it all does tend to fade rather quickly.I can't think director del Toro had much to do with bringing about the special effects other than writing his brief ('I want monsters that look like reptilian dinosaurs, but which emit an eery blue light from their throats. By Friday. Oh, and they must be Republican supporters or the young shavers watching this film just won't be persuaded') so whoever operated the PCs for the CGI and designed it all should get a cheer or two. But a film needs more than just neat CGI.The characters: the grizzled, dedicated leader who gives his life for mankind (Idris Elba), the pretty female aide who demonstrates she's as good as any boy (Rinko Kikuchi), Our Hero (Charlie Hunnam), the Oz father and son team (Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky), the obligatory faux comedy double-act (Burn Gornam and Charlie Day) and a - very underused - criminal mastermind (Ron Perlman) have about as much life about them as your average stock comic book protagonist, but the actors say the corny lines they are given, always find their marks and generally don't disgrace themselves, even if none is a contender for this year's Oscars. All, I'm sure, would cope with more demanding material without any bother at all.So there you have it. If you like hamburgers, this most certainly looks the part of a hamburger and then some. If you actually want it to taste of hamburger, save Pacific Rim for another day. At the time of writing IMDb users have given this an average 7.4/10. Don't be fooled. I've seen a lot better, despite the CGI.","

"DubhDoo","11 August 2013","At first glance, 'Pacific Rim' may seem like Guillermo Del Toro selling out â it's his first blockbuster with a budget shy of $200 million, featuring giant robot battles. However, this film is no sell-out; it is clearly a Guillermo Del Toro movie, maybe not as much as 'Pan's Labyrinth' or 'Hellboy' were, but a Guillermo Del Toro movie nonetheless. It is possibly his most personal â he said one of the reasons he made was ""to reconnect with his inner eleven year old"", being inspired by all the Kaiju movies he marvelled as a child.The film opens with a narration by the protagonist, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) chronicling how giant monsters (Kaijus) emerged from a portal in the Pacific Ocean and began to destroy cities. In response, mankind developed giant robots (called Jaegers) piloted by two people to destroy them. Now, with the threat worse then ever, Jaeger commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) calls Raleigh back into action so that they can ""cancel the apocalypse"".'Pacific Rim' might not be as deep or nuanced as some of Del Toro's previous work, but as a giant monster movie it's faultless. You want giant robots hitting giant monsters? You got it. The action sequences here are some of, if not the best, the Mexican filmmaker has directed, they're easy to follow, beautifully staged, exciting and most importantly, great fun to watch. When hero Jaeger, Gypsy Danger, pummelled a Kaiju with a large ship, I couldn't help but smile. And that's one of the best things about the movie â it is pure fun from start to finish, making a nice change from the dark, brooding blockbusters that are around today. It has a light tone with some silly humour (courtesy of the zany scientist duo) and a lovely cameo from Del Toro regular Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau (continuing the film's line of brilliantly-named characters).Sure, you could criticise the film for having one-dimensional characters, clunky dialogue and a thin plot, but when said film is so exuberantly fun, these things don't matter one bit. I was always engaged with the characters, rooting for them as they battled the Kaiju, despite the fact that they weren't exactly original creations. This is undoubtedly helped by the fact that performances are solid all-around, particularly Idris Elba who makes the often cheesy 'call-to-arms-speech' rousing. As pure entertainment, this is one of the best films of the year so far, it's a Kaiju movie that also looks and feels like a live- action anime film. Robots vs. monsters? 'Pacific Rim' does what it says on the tin and frankly, that's enough.","

"americanentertainmentrep","22 July 2013","(WARNING: THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS, BUT I DO THIS SO YOU WILL NOT GO SEE THIS FILM. âJIM)My companion and I played a game before we went to see ""Pacific Rim."" The object was to guess the clichÃ© from past similar ""the world is being destroyed by monsters"" films and how many rip-offs from other similar films. I believe we scored an A+. We weren't five minutes into this piece of expensive garbage when we heard; ""Don't get cocky, kid!"" I got a point for predicting that. This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen: bad acting, a bad plot, and lots of stupid stuff.The plot, if you can call it that, has us (planet Earth) being attacked by giant Godzilla-like creatures, who come through a fissure in the floor of the Pacific Ocean. To fight them off, we (the people of Earth) put aside our hateful ways toward each other and build giant 30-story- tall robots that require two people to perform a computerized mind meld to run. (""My thoughts to your thoughts, my bad script to your bad script...."") The machines fight the monsters, blah, blah, blah. We start to win, then the tide turns and the monsters start to win, until the one rebel pilot returns to finish the job.Aside from the monsters looking like Godzilla, other rip-offs include: machines that look like Rosie from the Jetson's mated with a Rockem' Sockem' Robot; the required nerd scientists trying to save the planet; a bad guy who collects dead monster parts; and a young Asian girl who wants revenge after her parents were killed when the monster attacked Tokyo. There is a crazy terminally ill general, slime from Nickelodeon dripping from the alien monsters, and parasites that were leftovers from Chekov's ear in ""Wrath of Khan."" Had enough? So have I! The only good part of this movie is that it was so bad I can give it the most awful rating I have: NO DYCE out of Fordyce. Don't bother and run away as fast as you can to another movie.CREDIT CHECK:There is a scene during the credits, but after the guy comes out of the monster, run from the theater and go right to church and pray to whatever deity you believe in and pray","

It goes from great truly impressive moments to incredibly dull filler. And the reason why the filler is so dull? It's because of the terrible writing and acting of the characters. The characters were not one dimensional, they were zero dimensional solely consisting of shouting and bravado. You'd think someone would inject a bit of personality into this but no! The ones that try are just annoying as hell. Watch this for the effects only, I recommend watching in 3D and with heavy use of the 10 second skip forward button.","

"OttoVonB","23 July 2013","Do you remember what it was like to experience wonder, as a child, at the flickering images on the screen. You didn't know that's what they were back then, or that the odd plot contrivance was just that and could mean the world (internet trolling didn't exist yet...). It was imperfect, but honest, immersive fun.This is the virtue of the nostalgic underdog film. A film that smells an untapped niche and goes on a joyful rampage through it. I think it's fair to say the original Indiana Jones did just that, revive childhood memories to create a roller-coaster devoid of cynicism. Gremlins did it. More recently, District 9 did it too.The Summer of 2013 gave us many examples of modern cinema at its worst: the cynical exploitation of childhood memories, evident in one sub-par reboot/remake after another. Action cinema as a whole has been aching from an emphasis on noise and scale rather than emotion and choreography (not just of action, but design and movement, both within and before the camera). It helps to have the new film of an earnest, geeky master to look forward to.Enter Guillermo Del Toro. Enter Pacific Rim. And here, hidden under a confused marketing campaign, is what we've been waiting for. A film that balances respectful nostalgia with irreverence (something Transformers and Man of Steel did all wrong in their respective extremes), a film that makes you remember what it was like to be a kid again. Rather than washed-out, fast-cut chaos, we get a neon-colored ballet of destruction through locations and between creatures and robots that scream the love of their creators in every frame.It's a silly film brilliantly made, and just when you wonder whether it isn't throwing certain tropes of its genre at you too literally - whether it be certain sub-stellar performances, mainly from leading man Charlie Hunman, a often predictable plot, etc. - it surprises you with a moment of sheer beauty. It makes you remember what it was like to be amazed, and it makes you hope. That the Kaiju genre is back for good. That people continue shoveling money at Guillermo Del Toro. That his Hellboy III and Mountains of Madness get made. That we see more of the great Idris Elba and Rinko Kikuchi, not to mention Mana Ashida (showcased here in a phenomenal flashback scene).A solid 9, no question about it.","

"sonicfan5715","1 August 2013","For those who may think this is a Transformers ripoff only because of giant robots, let me tell you that this film is far better than any of Michael Bay's crap lately. The first Transformers film was the only remotely good one, but even this film tops that. Guillermo del Toro's films have always been a favorite of mine (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy 2, and so on), and I trusted that with his hand behind this giant robot vs giant monster plot, that it would be good. 2 hours later, I was taken completely back.Pacific Rim is simply, wait for it, AWESOME. The effects and animation on the Jaegers and Kaiju are phenomenal, and the fight scenes are some of the best giant creature fights you've ever seen. You can actually tell what's happening, and see every devastating blow these beast lay out on each other. And the acting is rather good too, thank God we didn't have to put up with a Lebouf performance, and Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, and Rinko Kikuchi deliver excellently as the three main leads. The story, though I don't want to give anything away, is told very well, and is easy to keep up with (unlike a clusterf*** like Transformers 2) and actually manages to tug at a few heartstrings, especially during a very well done and unsettling scene with a young girl in hong Kong in a flash back.Point is, go see this movie. Belay any negative comments you've heard about it. If everyone gave this a chance, there's something in this movie that they would all enjoy from any aspect of it. Amazing effects and fight scenes, good solid acting and characters, fun story, all rolled into one to make (until part 2 of the Hobbit) my favorite film so far this year.9/10 Pacific Rim","

"chrysoberylz","11 July 2013","*9 / 10 This first thing that came into my mind when I watched the trailer is that this movie is like Mobile Suit Gundam. Yeah, that anime. Unless that the robot is controlled by two pilots. The robots here are called ""Jaeger"". Then the monsters. Godzilla's friends? Ultraman's new nemesis? They call the monsters ""Kaiju"".I have great expectation in this movie. Guillermo del Toro is a director with lots of experience and I don't think that this movie will go wrong or mocked by the audience. Not only as director, he also wrote the screenplay! We know that Guillermo del Toro is not just a director, he is also a writer, sometimes as producer, too. We all know that his Hellboy movies are awesome so this Pacific Rim should be entertaining.The movie's prologue told us about the Kaiju attack all around the world. Then the human race built giant robots to fight the Kaiju to save the world. Then the main characters were introduced one by one. Their past, their characters, and their craziness. The storyline is set in perfect proportion and perfect order. No character's story is too short or too long. We know that Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) is the main character but everyone got their screen time equally.And, uh, a bit applause for the budget. This awesome movie's budget is ""only"" US $180,000,000! I don't believe that, actually. The special effect is awesome. This is what I call ""Sci-Fi magic""! Awesome shot, and the scene when Gypsy Danger sliced the Kaiju's wings above the Earth's atmosphere was so stunning. I cannot erase that scene from my mind. My gosh that scene was really awesome, and more stunning than any scene in James Cameron's Avatar (2009). That. Scene.Many said that this movie is quite similar as Transformers. Nope. It's not same at all. Transformers are basically aliens and these Jaegers were artificially made by humans, and had pilots. The concept is like playing Wii or Kinect games, like a simulator. The pilots controlled the Jaegers by moving around and also lots of buttons that I don't understand.The drama thing in here is also good. The sad moment when Stacker (Idris Elba) said goodbye to Mako (Rinko Kikuchi), also Herc (Max Martini) and Chuck Hansen (Robert Kazinsky)'s last encounter. Those scenes almost bring me to tears. The only hilarious character in this movie is Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman), and Dr. Newton (Charlie Day), maybe. Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) is another extra point to this movie. He's smart but, like typical smart people in movies; he is also stubborn but in the end he could accept another people's opinion.To conclude all of the things above, this movie is really worth watched. This is not just a gigantic robots movie. The storyline, the action, the special effects, the concept and the execution are balanced one to another. Pacific Rim is the black horse in summer movies so far.","

"jahanzeb-farooq","7 August 2013","Totally loved it. An awesome film with STUNNING visuals. Seeing those giant robots walking in the sea alone is worth ticket's price. Del Toro's passion and perfection speaks for itself. Not in a single place you find the CGI or visuals lacking. CGI is so damn perfect which isn't a small feat given that it's a film about giant robots fighting giant monsters. And man do these robots look beautiful and awesome? Like a piece of art. And they are done so perfectly, each and every movement, every little detail, has been given attention. These giant robots really put all what we have seen in Transformers to shame. The action scenes are jaw-dropping and are so brilliantly choreographed, without ever going over the top. It's a pity that this film couldn't do well on box office while every other crap coming out every day makes tons and tons of money. I sincerely hope Del Toro gets to make a sequel.","

"fawn_jane","2 August 2013","I loved watching this movie in 3D in the theater! This movie made me feel like a kid again, I was absorbed and entranced by the stunning, colorful action and visuals. It's the kind of movie that gives you something to daydream about. I loved watching and idea of these giant robot Mechs. Gives you that I-love-science-and-technology feeling.The entire movie has this quality I have never seen before, wherein the feel of it was bleak and gritty, but at the same time it was very colorful and futuristic and fantastic.These days in action movies often the action sequences are hard to follow because the director employs too many cuts and blurs, I assume to make it seem more exciting. But here I never had the thought, as I often do in other action movies, ""When is this action scene going to end... yawn... what is even going on?""I took off one star though because the movie isn't perfect. For instance, the main character is extremely forgettable, I could not even tell him apart from this other more minor character in the movie that looks similar. And then there was Elba's character and performance, there was something off about it. It's hard to put into words, the delivery of his lines was unconvincing at times: flat or the timing was off.I enjoyed the female lead. She's a gentle soft-spoken Japanese woman, and the movie does not apologize or overcompensate for it. Her character isn't the generic female lead who sneers at Mr. reckless rebellious protagonist at first and then gets won over and falls in love with him. Instead the male and female leads develop a hearty platonic friendship based on mutual understanding and shared experience.The movie had a rainbow of colorful characters, like the goofy scientists, the bleach-blonde rockstar-looking russians you see in the background, Ron Perlmen's character, they were all welcome comic relief to whole serious aliens-are-trying-to-wipeout-all-of-humanity situation.The movie is well done, but there is no denying it is completely formulaic. I instantly saw so many parallels between this movies and for example, Independence Day. The film is very much classic Hollywood, three-act, Joseph Campbell's-Hero's Journey stuff.And the whole premise of the movie doesn't make sense. If aliens were attacking earth, why would you build two-legged humanoid mechs to punch them and shoot at them at close range? Makes zero sense from an engineering standpoint. But all that is forgivable because after all... MECHS! But still worth pointing out... there are other things in the movie like that but I won't get into it.The special effects in the movie are amazing, and the director knew what he was doing with them. There were so many points in the movie where I was just in awe of how beautiful and well-put-together the action and special effects were. Moments where I appreciated watching something that felt absolutely PERFECT.If you are in the mood for a colorful action movie, run to the theaters now! I could see someone not liking it though if they need something deep or logical, this movie is a fun formulaic action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.","

"Red_Identity","3 October 2013","I didn't have any expectations going into this and also didn't have much knowledge about it aside from Del Toro being the director. In a short description- it was excellent! A ton of fun, great characters, amazing visual effects, a story that doesn't fall under clichÃ©s. That's basically it in a nutshell, and the actual story stands-out from all of these seemingly formulaic and predictable blockbusters. I was hesitant about Charlie Hunman (although I remember him from Undeclared, much skinnier back then though) but he was a pretty great leading man and I have high hopes for his future. Del Toro nailed it with this, and hope he continues to give us more mainstream-fare.","

"0w0","6 May 2020","Why on earth would you go from being a top-tier pilot for the military, to being a construction worker? That just makes no sense... I know that they did it so that the character that Charlie Hunnam plays would seem like an 'everyman's man', but it simply doesn't make sense.Another thing that doesn't make sense: Why are all the Jaegers (robots) melee? That makes very little sense in reality... why engage with melee Kaiju (monsters) in melee? Why not just build Jaegers that have a crap tonne of missiles and lazer weapons, and blast the Kaiju into another dimension from far away? I know the movie would be drastically different if that were the case, but it would also be much cooler imo, because everyone knows big guns are better than big swords. I just think it's a huge plot hole.But other than the gaping plot-holes that this movie has, the movie is a 2hr trip filled with good CGI and a tonne of sci-fi and action fans will love it. For once though, I'd like to see the main actor+actress NOT end up kissing... it's a completely played-out trope that needs to be put on ice for a few years, honestly.","

"view_and_review","26 February 2018","With Pacific Rim Uprising about to be released I felt compelled to watch its predecessor if I'm going to watch the Uprising. Pacific Rim reminds me a lot of Robotech, a cartoon I used to watch a bit as a kid. At its core, Pacific Rim is an alien invasion movie not too unlike Independence Day. Earth is being serially attacked by these humongous creatures from another dimension coined Kaiju (which is Japanese for Monster). The world forces pooled their resources to create machinery to combat these Kaiju and they coined these mega machines Jaegers (German for giant). The Jaegers, operated by human pilots, dutifully protect the planet until the Kaiju become too much to handle. That's when they need real heroes.If it weren't for the action this movie would be a total waste because the story and the dialog is extremely unimaginative. The script and the acting even is sophomoric and has no real depth. Fortunately they had extra cool robots to take our attention away from the story. But even the action got to be overdone. It became destruction porn. Large cities being easily ripped apart by giant aliens and their pursuers--that gets old. How many movies with mega-beings or super-beings are going to lay waste to cities? I can only stand to see so many buildings destroyed before it all looks the same.The robots were nice, the creatures were nice but everything else was mediocre at best; the characters, the drama, the acting. This could've been a short film and been more effective.","

"jmoneyjohal","19 November 2013","Pacific Rim is Transformers on steroids, meets Godzillas father who is far more superior. The film has Action that has never before seen its MINBLOWING!!! The film is a visual mastery... The film is a slow and clichÃ©d in parts, but this film is pure cinematic entertainment so you forget the few hiccups. The films story is about how how monster called kiagges come from the bottom of the ocean and are destroying the world. Humans than create jaggars, robot machines to combat the monsters. Overall it a must watch for all who love action and sci fi films!!! Also i recommend you watch the film in 3D because the film is way more appealing when you feel like you are in the battle ;)","

I mean, I was previously informed Pacific Rim was original, and I was like: whaaat?Granted I don't believe this movie was made to be original. It was simply, and boy was it simple, made to dazzle with great visuals and giant robots vs. giant aliens. Literally, there is nothing else of substance to this movie. The acting was subpar, the dialogue atrocious and the comedic touches wereÂwell, never funny. Hell, I even love Charlie Day from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, but he was so hard to watch here.Don't get me wrong, there were a few clever ideas here and the visuals and special effects were literally, huh, out of this world, but I don't see or appreciate movies that are based on one single attribute. And with such lush FX and CGI â which I normally don't like, but here was great thanks to one of the best and creative directors, Guillermo del Toro, the movie did carry me and was incredibly better than some of the movies it stole from, such as Battleship or any of the Transformers disasters.Here's where I usually give the synopsis, and believe me, I'll be as brief as they were, despite the over two hour runtime: Since aliens coming from outer space is sooo passÃ©, these aliens decided to come up from the ocean and they're huge. Seeing that they're virtually indestructible with our current weapons, Earthlings decide to build Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots of equal size. While forced, emotionless drama and little to mostly meaningless background takes some of the screen time, the bulk of the film is fights between the good guy/bad guy giants.If I were a kid, damn I probably would've loved this; I craved Godzilla, and the like, big monster movies. Back then, I didn't care so much about drama, originality or depth, but as I got older and have seen thousands of different movies than I had as a child (see above for an incredibly short, albeit relevant taste,) I grew tired of the same ole stuff. It's not like I lost in touch with my younger self, but children need a lot less to impress them than educated adults.And after this, plus the major disappointments with Battleship, Avatar and even 1998's Godzilla, I still have faith 2014's Godzilla won't let me down. I believe it will fulfill my childhood desires, but also have some depth, real characters and more than a hint of a story. Is that too much to ask when a director is given nearly $200 million dollars that he spends more than $200 dollars on the script?* * * Final thoughts: In my first paragraph, I picked some of the most relevant movies that I've seen that I believe this mimicked or flat-out stole from. For even more big monster movies I might have missed, check out the Wikipedia page for Movie Monsters.","

"FlashCallahan","14 June 2014","When we looked up, we should have looked down, would have been a better tag line for this movie.It's basically monsters versus robots, Del Toros's Power Rangers if you would, and that is the fundamental plot of the film, and unfortunately, it has very little to offer, other than wonderful effects.It plays very much like a video game, the monsters get bigger and more difficult to destroy, whilst in-between these fights, we are 'treated' to cut scenes of the people in the machine, having problems and trying to get on with each other.And this is the big problem with the film, lack of character development. Hunnam (?spelling), is the tortured soul who is lured back into action by Elba, who has never been more wooden than this.Add an angry Jock, his dad, a love interest with a paternal connection to Elba, two comedy scientists, Ron Perlman in his obligatory cameo, and a bulldog, you get a very dull movie.The creatures are awe-inspiring to begin with, but they soon become tiresome, just like the Transformers did.It's easily Del Toro's lowest point, and one of the biggest disappointments of 2013.When you see it, you will understand why it tanked, for a movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters from the sea, it's bloomin' boring.See Robot Jox instead, at least it's funny.","

"jeffrey-utley","24 July 2013","'Pacific Rim' looked to me like a mindless action movie in the trailer. I thought I was going to the theater to seeing two hours and eleven minutes of giant robots piloted by humans fighting giant aliens. Just about the first hour of this movie makes it more than a mindless action movie. This movie focused on the backgrounds of characters for a while and used character development to make us care about them more. That worked for some of the characters.The acting in this movie as about average. Some of the performances were better than others. Some aspects of actors' performances were better than others. Charlie Hunnam was more of a lower quality performance. In some parts of the movie, I wasn't convinced he was really Raleigh Becket (his character in the movie), because he wouldn't say some of the dialog with feeling. It was like he was just reading lines some of the time. He had a bit of a British accent in the movie, but it seemed like it was only in affect in a small number of scenes in the movie. I don't think that anyone has a British accent in only a few parts of their life, so that makes it a bad thing. That bring up another performance: Idris Elba's. He had a better British accent than Hunnam, but it still only seemed to be in affect some of the time. Also, his acting performance was good, but he wasn't able to put enough stress on words at times. When Stacker Pentecost (his character) was supposed to put deep feeling into his words, Idris Elba wouldn't be able to put enough feeling into the words. Other than those things, his performance was fine, though. Rinko Kikuchi, who played Mako Mori, had the best performance out of the all of the actors I can think of. She didn't have any accent problems, she was able to put enough stress on words, and I was convinced she was Mako Mori. Her performance was good.I couldn't find any problems with the writing in this movie. I didn't look for any problems in the writing, but it seemed realistic. In some parts, it seemed it little far fetched, though.The CGI in this movie was great. It really didn't seem like nothing was there. All of the images blended in with the aspects of the scene. When there was almost nothing but CGI, it seemed like they (the images) were real. The only time I would really tell if there was CGI (if I didn't already know) if it was compared to an actual image.Now, for the things I went to the movie to see: the action sequences. The action sequences were just CGI's fighting each other. I thought the sequences were great. They were very exciting and exhilarating. The sequences also didn't happen as much as I thought they would, but more would've been less, I think. It might have been like 'Man of Steel', where the action took a long time to get old. Here, the sequences never got old and they stayed exciting. The action was even better than I thought it was going to be in this movie. There's a clear reason for almost everything which causes less thinking during the scenes. Several points to the film for the acting sequences and events.About the first forty five minutes of this movie after the title came up were character background and development. It did introduce characters and tell their purpose in the story, too. It was interesting at first, but it got old after a while. There was some drama, but it was just slow. I don't know why this movie wanted to be slow in the beginning. Some action movies have been slow in the beginning, but it just didn't work in this one. For the mood of this movie, the logical thing wouldn't be to be slow in the beginning. Being like this almost only takes points away from the movie. Knowing so much about the characters did imply different tones of the movie later on when things would reflect on the character's past. The slowness of the beginning of the movie didn't only consist of character background buildup. Only about half of it consisted of that.'Pacific Rim' has great images and scenery, barely-below-average acting, average writing, amazing acting sequences, very deep characters, and is well done, but has some bad performances and some boring parts. It was very exciting, had explainable events and aspects, and had a good story. I very much recommend this movie and might buy this movie on DVD when it comes out. My 8/10 rating means 'Pacific Rim' is really good.","

"Critomaton","11 August 2013","Pacific Rim is a fun movie that's worth seeing in the theater. Its only real flaw is that it leaves you with the feeling that with just a little more effort it could have been a lot more fun.The special effects are very good, but the film spends more time focusing on the robots than the monsters - I wish the director would have adjusted that balance slightly. The battles are exciting, but it's not a good sign when the penultimate fight is way more thrilling than the final battle. The final monster battle is so muddled that it's hard to tell which monsters, if any, are taking damage, dealing damage, being defeated, etc.The character underdevelopment in this movie is so conspicuous as to appear deliberate. In fact, it's a good thing Charlie Hunnam already has several seasons of Sons of Anarchy under his belt to prove his acting chops - I doubt if his performance in Pacific Rim will have his agent's phone ringing off the hook. Idris Elba does a fine job trying to channel drill instructors R. Lee Ermey, Lou Gossett, Jr., and Michael Ironside. But it's a bit of a letdown when we find out that the big, mysterious secret he's protecting is that he is a father figure to Jax Teller's cute Japanese co-pilot. Although I must admit that good dad/bad son is an interesting alternative to good cop/bad cop, that whole dynamic with the Australian Jaeger pilots was still played out in a very clichÃ©d and unbelievable way. I would have preferred a little less focus on them and a little more dialog from the other Jaeger pilots. The most well developed characters are also the two most obnoxious: the eccentric scientists. Charlie Day is the Bobcat Goldthwaite for our time, but at least with Bobcat you knew his mannerisms were just schtick. With Charlie Day you're never sure, and that's twice as annoying. I guess the other guy is the Crispin Glover for our time - I have no idea what to think about that. In the end, a monster movie should be about monsters. There are a few well done snippets of monster fights in the daylight, but the majority of the confrontations take place at night, or during the rain, or underwater, or some combination of the three. For all the realism, it's still often hard to figure out exactly what is going on.Ironically, even with all the millions of dollars spent on incredibly convincing robot and monster effects, the connection between the Jaeger pilots and their machine looks like a cheap vacuum cleaner hose. That kept making me laugh and taking me out of the moment.Still, there are just enough plot twists thrown in to keep things interesting - from the black market in Kaiju parts to the risk/reward of ""drifting"" with the Kaiju. At over two hours, this is quite a long movie, but to its credit it doesn't really drag too much. Iron Man 1, 2, and 3 all dragged out their ""time between big action sequences"" as much, if not more, than Pacific Rim.I'm hoping I'll like this movie even more after a second viewing, just like I did with Hellboy II: The Golden Army. But as with H2:TGA, I can wait for it to come out on cable TV.I can't remember whether Pacific Rim set itself up for a sequel or not, but I had enough fun watching it that I'd pay to see one.","

"thinker1691","25 November 2013","Guillermo Del Toro directed this futuristic story by Travis Beacham and created a futurist setting where Mankind is faced with total annihilation. Attacking from within a Time-energy portal, a series of Gigantic and colossal monsters set about to destroy the world's populations and absorb it's natural resources. To stop them, the world's humans do what they have never ever done before, they unite. Crafting colossal Robots the humans enclose two mentally linked pilots (Charlie Hunnam and Diego Klattenhoff) to combat their adversaries in the deep oceanic trenches of the Pacific Ocean. Idris Elba plays the General in charge of Operations and Ron Perlman plays the scavenger parts dealer. The movie is one gigantic world wide conflict with titanic battles and super powerful beings and there is no shortage of super struggles. The Humans are hard pressed to fight the incredible monsters, while the creatures are Ratcheting up their plan of world conquest. If one were to select a slight criticism of the movie I would ask why 90% of the movie is filmed in the dark. It is difficult to study all the fantastic art work which went into the filming and the story itself is hobbled by inconclusive ends which remain unresolved. Still what there is of it has the audience mesmerized with gigantic battles which absorbed every bit of interest in the theater. This movie is one for the Classics and one would not be surprised if it generates a sequel. Easily recommended. ****","

"jaredkjacoby","10 May 2020","Kaiju emerge from underground and bring humanity on the brink of extinction. Jaegers are the machines created to combat these monsters. Jaegers are Kaiju-sized robots controlled by two pilots who share a strong bond. One Jaeger pilot loses his brother in a fight with a Jaeger and when he is down on his luck, his former commanding officer recruits him again to battle against the Kaiju in Hong Kong to prevent the apocalypse, or in this case, cancel the apocalypse.I have a bit of an interesting history with Pacific Rim. I saw it when I first came out and I thought it was the coolest movie ever and I defended it against anyone who called a dumb popcorn flick. It is the film that got me into watching more movies. To kick off the summer, I wanted to watch this movie to see how well it holds up... there will be some spoilers ahead.Pacific Rim is an outstanding blockbuster film that delivers everything you could ask for. The characters are wonderful and extremely likable. Raleigh Becket is a charismatic and likable lead who starts out as this energetic and cocky guy who changes into a stoic soldier after he sees his own brother get eaten by a Kaiju. It makes since why he is not the most cheerful person in the world. There are many protagonists in action films that either get on my nerves, that are the chosen one or have the same story, but Raleigh is just a normal person who suffered a tragedy in a battle with a Kaiju and was recruited by Stacker after finding himself down on his luck. He has nothing to lose after finding himself on construction. Speaking of Stacker, this character is one of the most badass in a blockbuster film. He knows how to take charge and he shows passion on not just the Jaegers, but to save the world and protect those he loves. Also, he has the coolest dialogue in the film. Finally, he his character has a great sacrifice. When I saw the movie the first few times, I was a little upset that he died, but now, I see that he got sick, and he wanted to die in a Jaeger. Mako is my favorite character in this film though. She is just an awesome character who is passionate about becoming a Jaeger pilot. At first, she seems to be beating Raleigh in training so it is confusing on why Stacker would not let her be one... until they test it out. This movie does a terrific job showing her weaknesses that she needs to overcome and why Stacker did not let her become a pilot for so long. It shows that while Mako is a badass character who can stand on her own, she is not perfect. The supporting cast is excellent as well. The scientists are comic reliefs, but they are useful for the plot and they are funnier than not. Even the character who is kind of antagonistic towards Raleigh and Mako ends up being respectable by the end of the film. Ron Perlman's character is honestly the weak point when it comes to the characters, but he is still really fun in his role. The characters are just great and even if they are not the deepest, they still get strong development and they all contribute to the plot to stop the Kaiju. The performances are terrific from everyone in this cast with the standouts being Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Charlie Day and Rinko Kikuchi.But what about the story? It is engaging from start to finish. It is about creatures underground coming to attack the world and how humanity decided to fight back with Jaegers. It even has some themes within the story. Deep down, this is a film about how humanity being down and out having to fight back with every last bit of strength they got. It is a movie that is about teamwork because almost every character in this movie contributes to the goal of stopping the Kaiju from making humanity extinct. In that, the film is very uplifting and even inspiring. Not inspiring in that it makes you want to write movies, but in that it will help you value teamwork more than ever before. The world building is fantastic with showing how Kaiju first attacked and how Jaegers work. They also show why the bond between the two pilots as well as their emotional state is important. The tone is perfect in this film. It has a couple moments of cheesiness, but it takes itself seriously for the most part and it works. The stakes are high and it feels like an actual apocalypse, not just any sort of fun action-packed adventure. Also, there are character moments that are done beautifully without needing exposition dumps. When Mako first enters the Jaeger and her memories cloud her mind, it shows her backstory beautifully with beautiful visual storytelling. There is no dialogue, everything you need to know about Mako's fears and even her relationship with Stacker are shown beautifully in those very emotional scenes with her as a child. It scenes like these that help make the characters so much more likable and by the time the battles role around, you root for them to win. I disagree with people who say that this movie lacks substance with its story, because I think it is definitely there. The story is engaging, even when the humans are the focus.But of course, I cannot talk about Pacific Rim without talking about the action scenes and visuals. They still look incredible! They have not aged a day and there are films that have much bigger budgets than this does that do not look nearly as good. The Jaegers look realistic and they are huge and scale. Not only that, but they feel big with their movement. They have weight. It feels about as realistic as it can get with a movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters. The Kaiju designs terrific as well as they mostly have unique designs and they are absolutely terrifying. I love that there are different categories to classify them. The CGI is perfect for both the Jaegers and the Kaiju. Honestly, I thought the Jaegers looked real when I first saw them. The set designs are grand and the scale is huge. The cinematography is breathtaking regardless of whether the focus is on the battle scenes or the training scenes. You can tell how much love Director Guillermo del Toro put into this film with his direction. He had so much passion for this film and it shows every second of the runtime. The action scenes are where this film truly shines. There is not a set piece in this film that is boring or badly shot in this film. The set pieces are pure fun and they let you see the impact that every punch makes and the destruction that comes as a result looks insane. They are beautifully shot and it is easy to tell what is happening. One of the best things about the action though is how rough the Jaegers have it. They get destroyed by the Kaiju often they do not have it easy at all. It makes it very satisfying to see how they win. The Hong Kong set piece is quite possibly my favorite action scene of all time. The scale of the giants, the neon colors with the rain, the Kaiju popping up out of nowhere from a building for a surprise attack, the Kaiju flying Gipsy Danger high in the sky, the destruction of the city and the constant back and forth between the Jaeger and the Kaiju. It is freaking brilliant and it is never dull for even a second. The climax is also under appreciated. It is visually stunning and colorful, the stakes are raised, the odds keep getting stacked for the heroes and it is an emotional ride. It is just a feast for the eyes. On a technical and production level, Pacific Rim has some of the best visuals and action scenes of any blockbuster film period. Also, the musical score by Ramin Djawadi is one of the best scores I have heard in an action movie. The main theme in this film is just amazing!Although this film is amazing, I do have a couple of minor issues. There are a couple of lines of dialogue that are kind of cringeworthy, particularly some of the humor. Like I said, Ron Perlman's character is the only character that I am not crazy about. However, his end credit scene is hilarious. Finally, I wish we got to see a little bit more from the other Jaegers. Other than that, I have no big problems with this movie.Every time I watch Pacific Rim, I adore it more and more. I know this review may indicate bias, but I genuinely think that this one of the best blockbuster films of the last decade. It is pure blissful fun from start to finish. I think it is a bit underrated even. I cannot recommend it enough and when you watch, make sure you watch on your biggest TV! This was one of my favorite films when I first saw it and it stays as one of my favorite films.The sequel on the other hand...","

"moejoedajoejoe","9 December 2021","This is my favorite ""Giant monster"" movie. It has a good cast including an exceptional performance from Idris Elba. This is action cheese at its absolute finest. The movie is also chock full of nerd in-jokes. The best way to watch this is to just relax and let yourself have fun. Break out the popcorn, have a few drinks, and completely disregard the sequel.","

"tinovalkki","4 August 2013","Pacific Rim takes summer block buster movie to it's new level. After a short and vigorous beginning the movie grows bigger than ever seen digital effect rumble. With the length of over two hours the movie is simply eye candy. Guillermo Del Toro holds the story just enough interesting that you can handle all that effect rumble. When all the Transformer movies are just empty digital effect after digital effect Guillermo Del Toro's apocalyptic world is just enough interesting to keep it watchable. Too bad that the story here is so cheesy and it has told so many times in so many different ways. But anyway this turbo loaded effect rumble is quite beautiful to watch. Many times you can see almost see a raindrop to fall from the neck metallic monster. 3D looks great even it hasn't use in every way it could have used. Movie is typical popcorn movie but the trouble here is that it can be too much to most of the viewers. You have to be geek enough to like it. For me there is no trouble to like it and it really is worth of movie ticket price. This movie is a digi-geeks wet daydream, but if you want a good story instead of effect rumble you better to avoid this movie.***1/2","

"basilisksamuk","25 May 2014","It took two sessions for me to watch this drivel. I fell asleep about half way through and had to see part two the following day.As far as I can make out this is about giant sea monsters vs transformers. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman play the gravediggers from Hamlet, badly. The two stars of Sons of Anarchy prove that they can't act their way out of a paper bag.Meanwhile Idris Elba puts in an embarrassingly bad performance ( Imagine the key speech from Gladiator written and delivered by Worzel Gummidge.) Action has been replaced by acres of CGI that might satisfy an eight year old but will fail to impress sentient beings evolved beyond the level of igneous rocks.The only redeeming feature of this film is that it is, at least, better than the pretentious and unoriginal nonsense that was Pan's Labyrinth.","

"travisvincent","4 October 2013","Pacific Rim is one of those movies that doesn't come along often. A big, loud, monster movie. PR borrows heavily from the Godzilla movies. Monsters and giant robots duke it out. The plot is simple enough to work: An underwater 'tunnel' has created a link from the bottom of the ocean to another dimension, that dimension is full of monsters who want to conquer earth because why not? the monsters have apparently done this before throughout the Galaxy so to them it's like riding a bike. The world however, decides to fight back, so they build these giant iron man robots (i mean seriously, they look just like Iron Man)anyway, so these giant robots now have to kill these monsters and destroy the tunnel. In between these events you have some impressive battle scenes. Some battle/fights scene take place off the coast of China, Three-mile island, another one takes place in downtown Tokyo (which is so amazing, i rewound that part of the film to watch again) in the middle of the film is a 20-30 min fight sequence that is just action cgi porn. It was amazing. The special effects are spot on and very realistic. Pacific Rim is now one of my all time favorite movies right up there with Jurassic Park, Cloverfield and War of The Worlds.","

"GrassCrown","2 August 2013","Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim was one of my most anticipated movies this summer. And boy did the movie deliver. I was grinning like an idiot for most of the movie. The movie is just so much damn fun and it had some of the most terrific fight sequences that I've ever seen. It also had great pacing, I wasn't bored at any point in the movie. The set up in the beginning is pretty much perfect as del Toro presents the Kaijus and how the world reacted to them. After that it's just almost non-stop action. Guillermo del Toro has really crafted a believable and expansive world that is full of detail. The visual look of the film was beautiful and full of color. You can just feel the joy and passion that del Toro had for the film through the screen. The art direction and the CGI effects in this movie are really impeccable. Guillermo Navarro also did a great job with the cinematography. The camera was always right where it should've been.The practical sets inside the robots were absolutely fantastic. If they'd done those in CGI, the movie would've definitely lost something substantial. I loved how it looked and how you got a great perspective into what it would be like to be inside of that robot. The practical sets that were used throughout the movie with the CGI really grounded the experience. The CGI Jaegers and Kaijus were done terrifically and they had a tremendous sense of weight to them. There was also enough differences between the Kaijus to keep the action interesting and the battles different. Every Jaeger also had a distinct theme to it and they were really well conceived. The sound design in this movie was also great and it really added to the intensity of the film. The great epic score by Ramin Djawadi really pumped me up during the fights. Despite the movie being a big spectacle it actually had good enough characters that I actually cared and rooted for them. I didn't like the scientists though, they were a bit too eccentric and over the top for my taste. Ron Perlman was funny though because he's just awesome as a person. I thought Charlie Hunnam made for a likable hero and Rinko Kikuchi does a great job as Mako. Idris Elba really nails his role as the tough commander with a heart. The drifting sequences were visually interesting and they were used well in conveying the backgrounds of the characters. The plot is what it is but it fits a spectacle movie like this pretty much perfectly. Approach this film with the right expectations and you'll have an enjoyable time. You have to see this in the cinema while it's still there, it really adds to the experience. It's an extremely enjoyable and fun pop corn flick, my favorite of the summer blockbusters so far.","

"filmaholic33","11 July 2013","I have been following this movie for a while now. Largely because of the two main actors Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba and I have to say I was not disappointed at all. Watched it in 3D (I have always strayed away from 3D before because I just didn't think it was worth spending the extra cash) but this time I do not regret my choice at all. It was a visual feast.Action was on point. The story flowed well (this is a blockbuster after all, we aren't going to compare it to an art house film). For me the actors embraced their roles very well and the visuals were magnificent (thank god once again for the 3D). Everything just felt right!Being familiar with Guillermo's past work I would say this is his best yet. His imagination is wicked. So if you are looking for great entertainment and a little something to wow you, this is the movie for you. Bravo. Two thumbs up.","

"ksj870","22 July 2013","Pacific Rim is the latest would-be blockbuster with anger issues. Once again, we have a movie that seems determined to show as much urban destruction as possible. This time, the combatants aren't opposing armies or even superheroes and super villains, but giant troll-like monsters and the equally mammoth robots designed to fight them off.Director Guillermo del Toro tries hard to distinguish his film from similar movies (Transformers, Avengers, etc) by not only the scale of the actionâwhich is incredibleâbut moreover by devoting a lot of screen time to the characters behind all the on screen mayhem. The script delves rather deeply into the psyches of our principal heroes, Raleigh and Mako (played by Charlie Hunnam and Riko Kikuchi), a pair of pilots who operate the aforementioned giant robots, and this is a wise move: when their war machine goes toe-to-toe with a ravenous behemoth, we know there's actually someone of flesh and blood inside all that metal. This increases not only viewer empathy but suspense as well. And Raleigh and Mako are genuinely interesting characters. Raleigh is a has-been veteran who may have lost the will to fight, while the winsome rookie Mako simmers with pent-up rage and fear beneath her calm, prim facade.Though both Hunnam and Kikuchi, as well as the extensive supporting cast (which includes Ron Perlman as a shady businessman who sells monster parts on the black market), are excellent in their roles, the standout performance goes to Idris Elba as the enigmatic Stacker Pentecost. Pentecost is the commander of the world's small army of robotic defenders, a man of iron discipline and penetrating insight who will do anything to defeat the monsters that have crawled up from the ocean's depths. Elba has always been a fine actor, but this is his best showing to date.Pacific Rim's biggest flaws are a slow middle portion and the fact that the story doesn't do as much with some of its main characters as it could. The script really lets us get to know these men and women as believable individuals, but then loses them in the mechanics of the plot. At 132 minutes, Pacific Rim couldn't have been any longer for theatrical release, but I'd be curious if a future Director's Cut DVD might flesh out some of the subplots that are left dangling in the movie as it now stands.Pacific Rim isn't far from being a really excellent action film, marred only by the above weaknesses. Those points do hold the film back from true greatness, but it's still a highly entertaining thrill-ride. Where else can you see a giant robot bludgeon a lumbering ogre into submission with a boat?","

"OleFr-Skj","14 August 2013","In 2013, humanity comes under attack by giant alien behemoths known as ""Kaiju"", emerging from a portal deep beneath the pacific ocean, costing millions of lives. After the world pools its resources together, the Jaeger program is created as a defense against the Kaiju. The ""Jaegers"" are powerful mech warriors, each piloted by a crew of two pilots, who have their minds connected to function as one with the Jaeger.Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), is one such pilot. Who lands in a slump after losing his older brother to a Kaiju. Several years later, with the Jaegers' efficiency and numbers diminishing and the Kaiju advancing, Raleigh is brought in to pilot his old mech, Gypsy Danger, as part of a last-ditch effort to end the war once and for all.I went into Pacific Rim having very little prior knowledge of the film. I didn't recognize a single actor, nor had I ever seen any of del Toro's movies before. All I expected to see was giant robots punching sea monsters, hopefully with enough intelligence and conviction to warrant my investment. And while the movie did indeed deliver precisely that, the way it went about it turned out to be a delightful surprise.What I'm specifically talking about is the setting and story. From the trailers I expected the movie to chronicle the origins of the Jaeger program and humanity's stand against the Kaiju. Instead we get a quite smaller scope, with only four Jaegers appearing throughout the film (two of which get very little screen time). To be quite frank, I was actually expecting an army of Jaegers.I actually liked this more compressed setting. Because even though it's still huge, it's also different, but in a good way. The smaller scope allows more room for character and, dare I say it, humanity to come into the film, and Guillermo del Toro does not let any of it go to waste.Like I said earlier, I was seriously bummed that half of the Jaegers were destroyed so quickly. They both looked really cool, and then they were just there for about ten minutes. For example: the three-armed red Jaeger, Crimson Typhoon, was defeated embarrassingly quickly, and it was by far the coolest looking one, too.I also had a few issues with the pacing. The movie opens with a long- winded narrative which, while it does clearly spell out for you what's happened and what the stakes are, I can't help but feel like there was an entire extra movie that was simply tucked away in there, for little to no reason.I also noticed was that there were a few instances where the CGI effects got a little overblown, especially during the film's climax. Luckily, these moments were few and far between.Finally, I found the ending to be a little bit too cheesy for my taste. It's not a huge problem, it just bugged me a littleBut with that said, there's just so much to love about Pacific Rim. Probably one of my favorite things was that a lot of the generic action blockbuster tropes show up in the movie, only to be either resolved quickly or taken in an unexpected direction. My personal favorite example is the rivalry between Raleigh and Chuck (one of Striker's pilots). They run afoul of each other because Chuck sees Raleigh as a has-been, and doesn't want him dragging everyone else down, Raleigh in turn is ticked off by Chuck's acting like a spoiled child and in general just being a massive dick. It's a typical machismo rivalry and I was expecting to hate Chuck up until the climax where he'd ""redeem"" himself. Not here. The rivalry is quickly resolved when Gypsy saves Striker from a double Kaiju assault, proving that Raleigh's still got it. Over and done with, bravo.The cast is all-around very competent, and receive enough character for us to actually root for them and wish for their victory. There is a genuine sense of danger when the Jaegers engage the Kaiju, and I did actually fear for their lives on multiple occasions. Again; bravo.The action scenes are absolutely superb, both well choreographed and visually stunning. They manage to convey a sense of fun that is sorely lacking in entertainment nowadays.The Kaiju are extraordinarily terrifying, I was actually a bit frightened by them, which I was also very impressed by. This adds to the element of danger and risk for the characters.In the end, Pacific Rim is big, exciting, thrilling and ultimately just plain fun.","

"listofnames","19 July 2013","OK, so yes its a special effects extravaganza involving giant robots (called jaeger) fighting giant monster aliens (called kaiju) from another dimension. Which sounds a little worrying especially when the trailers make it look like a longer mighty morphing power rangers episode. It had so much potential to be awful. Guillermo Del Toro (science fiction/fantasy/horror storyteller extraordinaire) of course was not going to let that happen. It turns out to be very entertaining and fun. One important thing to mention to anyone not in the know is that this film is heavily indebted to the many Japanese films and TV series which tackle a similar giant robot/mecha suited subject. I think perhaps (not that I'm an expert) most notably the TV and film series Neon Genesis Evangelion. I imagine this is the sort of thing that inspired and influenced this film. Which of course is a great thing given how flipping good the first two film recaps have been. If you haven't seen any of this please go seek it out. Therefore it is a nice touch that one of the main characters in Pacific Rim is a Japanese women. Most of the action is set in Hong Kong but unfortunately, while there is a Chinese Jaeger team and also a Russian team, both have very little screen time or speaking parts. Apart from the main team in the story - Mako and Raleigh, the team with the 2nd most focus is given to the rather bland father and son (Australian? - the accents were hard to define) team. I found myself not caring too much about them to be honest. Felt more for the Chinese and Russians who had much less characterisation. Perhaps the film producers felt that they needed to have a larger white male presence in the film to reflect the films probable viewing demographic. Which I'm sorry to say is just dull, lazy and boring. I'm sure this sort of consideration is necessary for any big expensive film to be given the green light but its sort of disappointing all the same. The first few minutes of this film manage to do something quite impressive. In this very short time they manage to give a very accurate and believable summary of the first 7 years of the kaiju/human/jaegar war. 7 whole years told exceptionally skillfully in a couple of few minutes. This sets up the film beautifully. Yes i said believable! How did they manage to make it seem realistic that huge monsters could rampage around major cities a la Godzilla? Plus the fact that said monsters originate from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the pacfic ocean? I don't know either but they did. The human interest stories are of course what make any film and the relationship between Mako and Stacker (Idris Elba's stern military leader) is quite compelling. A scene involving Mako's initial encounter with a Kaiju and then Stacker as a child is really quite poignant. The child actor plays the part so realistically (all strained breathing and crys) that you wonder if she thought it was actually happening. Of course there's a whole lot of fun stuff too. Did i mention the giant robots fighting giant alien monsters? Well, its done well, you can actually follow what's happening and the there is invention and creativity in the fights. The special effects are of course top notch. Charlie Day's scientist character is a good laugh throughout the film. The 'drifting' concept (2 humans must share the 'neural load' of piloting a Jaegar and drifting is kind of like a mind meld where they share each other's minds and therefore memories) is used to good effect. All in all this is as fun and intelligent a film can be considering its plot :) So go see!","

"SugarandIce","9 December 2013","I went into this film expecting a big, stupid monster vs mecha movie. I had no desire to see it as the trailers had failed to impress me. The very first scene however, took my breathe away. It had been so long since a film totally immersed me in its world. I felt a chill down my spine as the jeager and kaijus first took screen. The CGI is outstanding and undoubtedly deserves the Oscar for it.The action? My God, the action. Transformers, take notes. If you want to make a tense, exciting battle scene, actually show what's going on and make the enemy actually dangerous. These Kaiju meant business so every skirmish was a heart pounding experience for me. The fact that the CGI was so convincing only enhanced this.Let me get this out of the way. I do not think this film is as stupid or badly acted as many other people do. In fact, I quite liked the leads, especially Mako. I felt this film did a good job developing their characters and building their friendship. The story is of course not spectacular. I'm not saying the acting is stellar either, but it's by no means bad. But this movie has heart. It has heart in its characters, it has heart in its theme about teamwork, and it has heart in its battles. There are few films I can give such praise to.","

"hkauteur","27 July 2013","As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.The fights are the main attraction. You either go along with that premise or not, there's no two ways about it. In reality, it's probably more resourceful to bomb these giant monsters or shoot them with a very big cannon, instead of making giant robots to punch them to death. But where's the fun in that? Suffice to say, the fights are a tense visceral experience and the scale of everything delivers an epic sense of awe. They do everything to up the ante and surprise the audience. Special moves are only used in climatic moments and there's just something about a giant robot using a boat as a bat that's just hilarious and jaw-dropping. These fights run very dangerously to the cinematic equivalent of watching somebody play a video game. That's why I like the drifting mind meld concept, because it solves that problem by it properly adding both physical and emotional conflict to the pilots controlling the Jaegers as well. It focuses to how well these pilots are controlling the Jaegers as opposed to how the Jaegers are fighting the Kaijus.The fights are shot somewhat tightly but for a very good reason. Shooting the fights close holds the tension and injects the sense of jeopardy and stake into every exchange in the fight choreography. I imagine if the fights were covered entirely in long wide shots, it would lose that sense of scale and the fights would look silly. That said, I had no problem following what's going on because emotionally it felt right to be watching them that way. And personally, it was doubly fun that the film was set in Hong Kong.There's been a common complaint that the characters lacked development, I disagree. Basically these people all have baggage and they have to band together as a team or fall apart. The film spends time building arcs for its ensemble cast, and it's sufficient to justify the epic robot monster fights. That's it, so I don't understand that complaint. Adding neat little quirks or oddball idiosyncrasies to these characters would have been overkill.The dialogue is one of the film's weaker portions. However, depending on how well each actor was able to milk the lines, I was still able to have fun with it. I couldn't stop cackling at Charlie Day's fast-paced high-pitched deliveries, who rises above being ""Dr. Exposition"" and balances the film with comic relief. Day's exchange with the rival math-based scientist played by Burn Gorman is essentially a cartoon-level quarrel equivalent to Daffy Duck arguing with Bugs Bunny. The math Gorman's scientist applies is is grade-school at best. Ron Perlman facetiously entertains in flying colors as the Kaiju body parts black marketer Hannibal Chau, the most asshole character name ever created. Idris Elba also adds significant weight as the team leader. So for me, the side characters take the cake from the Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi storyline, which was played very straight for story purposes.Guillermo del Toro is aware of current big-budget blockbuster tropes and differentiates himself from those trends in Pacific Rim. There are no homage or geek references to distract or alienate the audience. Rinko Kikuchi's Mako character is not sexualized or filmed through a salivating male gaze; she is a real human character with a story and treated as such. The film doesn't play like a military recruitment advertisement nor has any blatant nationalistic or jingoistic intentions. Perhaps one of my favorite things about Pacific Rim is it tonally divorces itself from post-9/11 sentimentality. The world has its own distinct fictional reality, where destruction is not linked by evoking imagery, memories or emotions from September 11th. Civilians evacuate from buildings, hide in shelters and the streets are clear for the Jaegers to bash the Kaijus. Most importantly, del Toro never dwells heavily on despair or hopelessness and the audience can enjoy the city-wide destruction guilt-free. All those things counted together, Pacific Rim is truly a breath of fresh air amidst current blockbuster aesthetics and a film made with the most earnest intentions.Without an A-list star, a love story or a recognizable established franchise (i.e. Godzilla or Transformers) , it's not hard to see why Pacific Rim didn't score at the box office. As Snakes On A Plane proved at its theatrical release, the geek fan base doesn't represent much of the core population. The geeks merely are just the most vocal. Perhaps other parts of the demographic are alienated just by the material itself, despite that del Toro is aiming to entertain everybody. If there's one underdog movie people should give a chance to this summer, let it be Pacific Rim. It's a passionate earnest film made by a director that loves the material and wants to deliver good clean fun with a positive message for everybody. His attention to every little detail exudes his excitement for the material; that passion rubbed off on me and elevated my enjoyment. It's the most fun I've had watching a movie this summer.

"petra_ste","20 July 2013","Pretty much the textbook definition of ""fun summer movie"", Pacific Rim takes a Lovecraftian scenario with giant Cthulhu-like monsters (""kaiju"") popping out of a portal in the middle of the ocean and mankind building giant robots to face them.Visuals are striking, with humongous reptilian creatures rising from the waves under a pouring rain and spectacular battles in cities laid to waste.The most interesting gimmick is how Mechs (""Jaegers"") require two pilots to work, and they need to share a neural connection: the better their mutual understanding, the more effective the robot. A promising plot point which could have been explored more.The script is serviceable. It moves fast and introduces some basic relationships and conflicts, like the broken hero who lost a loved one (Charlie Hunnam), the rookie with a personal vendetta against the monsters (cute Rinko Kikuchi), the stoic gravel-voiced leader (Idris Elba), the arrogant rival like Iceman in Top Gun - who, incidentally, is quite indistinguishable from the protagonist: if you cast two blonde guys with similar faces, age, height and build, and even put space suits on them, at least give one a moustache or something. Minor characters like the Russian and Chinese pilots are so sketchily drawn they come across as caricatures.Del Toro has reportedly been struggling for years to adapt Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness. Pacific Rim evokes Lovecraftian imagery, but is essentially an attempt to take the sting out of it (more palatable to a mass audience!) by adding heroic characters, romance and an optimistic tone.From a director of Del Toro's caliber I was expecting something more special and personal, but a competent, entertaining blockbuster is already a cause of minor celebration in these days.6,5/10","

"heisenberg1925","11 July 2013","Pacific Rim is the most ambitious project undertaken by Guillermo del Toro at this point in his career. I'm a huge fan of his work. Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy films are among my personal favorites. Anime fanatics who are familiar with Neon Genesis Evangelion will be quick to notice the striking resemblance to some of the ""mecha"" (giant robots) featured in the movie, but the similarity ends there. Although the majority of big-budgeted Hollywood movies that have been released over the years were derived from comic books, classic cartoons or novels with a solid fan base, this film is a cut above the rest. Del Toro took a risk and created his own version of ""Transformers"" far relieved from Michael Bay's commercial-like robots and in all honesty,he just might give him a run for his money. In a not-so-distant future where giant beasts or ""Kaiju"" wreak havoc in major cities across the globe, our only fighting chance of defeating these creatures is through the Jaeger Program. The giant robots aptly called ""Jaeger"" are driven by two pilots where it's controlled simultaneously by melding their minds through a neural bridge. I'm not going into further detail but they completely redefined what ""drifting"" means. Other countries have joined the Jaeger Program including China, Russia and Japan but Australia's Striker Eureka and USA's Gypsy Danger were given more screen time. The intense battle scenes between the Jaegers and several types of Kaiju are almost surreal. I don't even know why they have to reboot ""Godzilla"" when this film just showed us several versions of his ilk. There was one particular scene when the Kaiju decided to take off with his bat-inspired wings and Gypsy Danger have no other choice but to shift into Voltron-mode wielding an enormous sword while suspended in outer space ( I guess they're trying to pay tribute to the classic Japanese anime).Charlie Hunnam was the perfect choice to play Raleigh Becket, a Jaeger pilot with a rebellious streak and the film's main protagonist. Becket's new co-pilot Mako Mori portrayed by Rinko Kikuchi played her part well despite her English sounding more like Japanese. However, she compensated for it with her remarkable Kendo fighting skills. Idris Elba who played Stacker Pentecost,leader of the Jaeger program delivered his part exceptionally well and steals every scene he's in. Even ""Hellboy"" star Ron Perlman had a small role as Hannibal Chau, a black market dealer for everything Kaiju-related. The remaining cast did what was expected from their respective roles. There's so much visual feast in this movie to revel in for fans of the genre and for the average moviegoer looking for a more satisfying cinematic experience. After watching a plethora of blockbuster movies in IMAX 3D, I have to say Pacific Rim is a standalone film that will captivate you from start to finish.","

"mhorg2018","19 February 2018","I'm really surprised that Del Toro created this garbage. Average story, monsters that looked like they were stolen (oh sorry, 'homaged') from the 1960's Gamera movies (especially the Knife nosed monsters), the only good thing I can say about this is it was slightly better than the last fifteen Transformers movies - all of which seemed to be the same movie. (That's sarcasm kids). A waste of a good cast, spouting platitudes that have been said in too many other movies. The 'action' scenes mostly at night or in the rain, were dull and unimaginative. Finally the final scene was a rip off of Independence Day. If I never see this again, it will be too soon.","

"ironhorse_iv","18 July 2013","It's a great summer blockbuster movie! This was a fun ride. Director Guillermo Del Toro did a great job. It's outshine the Transformers series way up! I don't think the movie was ripping off a lot of Japanese Kaiju movies like 1954's Gojira and others, but making tribute to them. I saw a lot of plot references from other Japanese mecha works such as 1979's Mobile Suit Gundam, 1995's Neon Genesis Evangelion, 1989's Gunhead. I do also see a lot of references from American films such as 1989's Robot Jox, and 1993's Power Rangers as well. I like to see Mechas and Kaiju monster fighting against each other, so this movie was a treat. It's 100% badass. The film was very good in terms of visual effects. It had some good CGI effects. The movie starts out in 2020s (Honestly, they should have move the date up more) with an invasion of alien monstrous creatures call Kaiju, started rising from the Pacific Ocean from a portal from a different dimension wreaking havoc on humanity. To combat the giant Kaijus, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But more and more Kaijus continue to enter the portal, more than the Jaegers could be build and pilots could be train. On the verge of defeat, the only hope for mankind is a last ditch attempt to seal the portal once and for all. I do have to say, I love the acting in this film. Nobody really kept it down. I love Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket, the washed up former pilot who has to team up with an untested trainee Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) to control the Jaeger robot Gypsy Danger. I think Mako Mori is a very strong female character that hold up her own in the film and girls can look up to. It's nice seeing a strong Japanese character portray like this, then the dumb eye candy that follows the main character around. The person that made the film was Idris Elba as Marshall Stacker Pentecost. He's so commanding in the role. I do have to say that the other characters were walking stereotypes. Charles Day as the over the top scientist, Ron Perlman as the black market kaiju organ dealer gangster Hannibal Chau, and Robert Kazinsky as the hot shot Top Gun's 'Iceman"" type pilot that is there just to be a jerk. While there is abundant ClichÃ©s and stereotypical characters. There was a pretty good emotional scene in the middle of the film that I love. Mako's flashback of her as a kid and the absence of other people emphasizes the terror she felt being all alone and chased by a kaiju. That little girl that portray a young Mako did an amazing job and I really felt for her, and the way she was holding on to her shoe was a highly powerful representation of her shock and fear, she was clasping to it for comfort and in that situation at that age. I do like how the film fits how the characters got to know each other by drifting. The mind meld drifting was still somewhat unclear. Using one right and another person left hemisphere to make one brain is confusing. I felt it was trying too hard to be 2010's Inception with this. Would repeat handshakes fill in the gaps that they apparently had? If they were wholly in each others' minds, do they really need to talk to each other? When the scientist drifted with the nearly dead brain piece how did the kaiju track him down? Why couldn't the kaiju just terraform the planet themselves and they kill the dinosaurs? It pose more questions than answers. The science in this doesn't make any sense at all, but after all it's a Sci-fiction movie, it doesn't have too. Honestly there were some things they could have cut such as the whole wall discussion and the side adventures of the scientist. It was stupid. They could have fit more time with the Jaegers. I was bit disappointed with the other Jaegers screen time. The action is amazing. I wish more daytime fights scenes with the monsters and more use of the sword. At less, give these Jaegers guns so they have more fighting chance. I can barely see what is going on with the night scenes. I think it's worth checking out in the theater. You will miss a lot if you don't go there. Just don't see it in 3D. 3D was annoying as it's hard to see due to 3D rain and snow. Everything was so dark, which hurts watching it in 3D. Everything happens at night for some reason, or underwater, or underwater at night, so it's hard to tell what's going on with in those scenes with the glasses on. Watching it on D-Box Simulators is interesting, but gimmicky. Very entertaining. The division of the film I think that cinema is moving towards a remarkable development and a very good overall story of the film is not original but exciting for the viewer. The Japanese have been making movies like this for years. Just without the fantastic CGI effects. So check out Pacific Rim!","

"terryfarrell","25 November 2013","After all the hype it was a complete let down. It was a mash of all the manned-robot movies or games that you have ever seen. The monsters were boring (thankfully they didn't really feature that much) and the robots were just robots. The plot tried to explain the reason for the monsters appearance: totally unimaginative.It was CGI in the extreme. The robots were bigger and more powerful, the backgrounds were unrealistic. Everything was so overdone and unreal.The story line was positively infantile. Before quarter way through I felt sorry for the actors who were trying so hard to overcome this pathetic script. I don't know why I watched to the end. Maybe I thought there had to be something more to the plot. Mistake.Bigger doesn't mean better and this movie proves it. The three points awarded are for those suffering actors.","

The mankind builds the ultimate machines known as Jaegers, huge robots neurally controlled by two compatible pilots that have their minds interlocked. Years after, Kaijus become more powerful and a scientist discovers that they are part of an alien plan to destroy mankind first and exhaust the planet after.

The plot is entirely predictable but there is a poor development of characters and even the introduction is too rushed for a 131 minutes running time movie. I was absolutely disappointed with Guillermo del Toro, a man that directed masterpieces like ""El espinazo del diablo"" or ""El laberinto del fauno"" making a detour in his brilliant career to Michael Bay's style with a shallow blockbuster like this. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""CÃ­rculo de Fogo"" (""Circle of Fire"")","

"TheConnoisseurReviews","12 July 2013","""Pacific Rim"" is a spectacle for the eyes and ears. I mean this movie is a visual treat from well detailed robot and monster designs to high over the top, but well choreographed action sequences and massive collateral damage. The world that Guillermo del Toro creates is imaginative and his character designs are mesmerizing and complex. The sound design and the sheer force of the films score captivates you into a ride of sight and sound that pleases all your senses. From the metal grinding noise of the robots to the fleshy and almost beast like cry the monsters make, this film has you feeling like you are right there in the middle of the action.While the movie is mostly is a visual treat, it doesn't forget about its characters and there humanity. The film isn't all bells and whistles, it really does have some really nice character moments in its script, which are about overcoming fear, moving on and trust. These moments make us care for the events that are unfolding. However, the script isn't all serious business, it knows when to have fun. Some of these moments can be a bit too campy though and some of the emotional moments feel forced. The film sometimes even becomes contrived, mainly towards the end. However, director Guillermo del Toro balances things pretty well.The actors in this film do a pretty good job, but the only real standout is Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost.This character is sort of the leader of the resistance and Elba commands attention every second on screen. Charlie Hunnam is pretty good as Raleigh Becket, a Jaeger pilot, who left the resistance after a traumatic incident. I wish they showed more of his inner battle, it would have invested us into the story more. Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori is really hit or miss. The scenes where she is more reserved are good, but when she tries to emote, it can be awkward at times. The rest of the cast is pretty solid and the supporting cast is pretty good, especially Charlie Day, who brings some of the lighter moments to the film.Overall ""Pacific Rim"" as a giant robot versus giant monster movie is pretty awesome. The visuals, sound, and well directed action are all top-notch. They provide a treat for the eyes like never before. Even the 3D is spectacular, the best I've seen since ""Avatar,"" it really absorbs you into del Toro's imaginative world. The story, mainly the human element, is a bit weaker as it can feel contrived at times. It keeps us involved, but never takes us to the next level of emotional satisfaction. I give it 4/5, a blockbuster with some of the coolest and most imaginative action that I have seen this year.","

"Targe","14 September 2013","I knew we were in serious trouble when it took 2/3 of the movie for the giant robot pilots to realize equipping their rock-em sock-em robots with swords might be helpful against giant monsters made of meat and bone...This movie is obviously a Japanese comic converted to an American movie. How strange then that there is one and only one Japanese character in the movie, a ridiculous scientist/robot pilot slash giggling schoolgirl because she has a crush on the lead character.There have been countless movies now about giant robots, and for some reason the robots in this franchise show up with nearly no weaponry, save for a plasma cannon on their hand that they strangely always save for the final blows, when they could be using it blow pieces off the charging rhinocerous like beasts on their first charge.Another bizarre item is the robots are flown around by fleets of Chinook helicopters, which would never work in real life and even CGI'd looks completely fake and unrealistic. Most of the robots are nuclear powered, why not give them jets so they can fly themselves in?? The strange lack of equipment on these behemoth robots only get's stranger when we learn that some models come with a giant rocket on the elbow to assist in punching. *GROAN*.... perhaps just give the thing a flamethrower on it's arm??? Toppers have to go to the science team duo. Hello, Pacific Rim? It's Big Bang Theory, THEY WANT THEIR CHARACTERS BACK!!! The movie so obviously rips off Leonard and Sheldon from BBT, that at times you would swear it really is Leonard. The guy dresses like him, acts like him, and talks like him! The British Snob Sheldon character thankfully was not a spitting image of Sheldon, but darn close in mannerisms.The movie staggers from one giant plot hole to the next, with acting that is horrific to behold.","

We know that special effects exist and they can pretty much do anything these days â so, big deal. (I didn't even think they were that special to be honest)I was squirming in my seat, anxious â waiting for it to end (it wasn't a quick death either, I can tell you).This is a B-movie in 2 years. We'll be poking it with a stick and laughing at it. In summary â run for the hills.","

"Pingo-2","16 October 2013","It still surprises me that one can get $190M USD to make superior action and wonderful CGI in a 131 minute movie - but leave out character development and serious and realistic sounding dialog. The ""scientists"" sounds like mice (are probably supposed to be funny) and the characters are, well... kinda boring.Too many HOORAH's and applauding scenes for me - not really sure why they're there anyway, it just makes a pretty stupid film more dorky.That said - the action sequences are beautiful and cool. The ""aliens"" are nice, though nothing you haven't seen before. Conveniantly, they have flashlights in their mouths too! It's sad that there are almost no Huge Robot-movies that can handle this theme with respect and make something serious. All Giant Robot movies doesn't have to be for kids. GANHEDDO (1989) is probably one of the only darker live-action giant robot films ever made.Pacific Rim is nothing but CGI animations battling it out for total destruction. There's no suspense, no build ups, no real movie here. But as a CGI show-reel, this is amazing.To be honest - the live action parts can be fast-forwarded (except for the Mako flashback scene, which is good - especially since it lacks dialog).I give it a 6 out of 10 anyway, because the director is a hero, Rinko Kikuchi did a great job - and I simply LOVE Giant Robots!","

"sohansurag","24 December 2013","Guillermo Del Toro has, first and foremost, been a visual director. Be it Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy or Hellboy 2 his level of visual flair is unsurpassed. More than that as evident from Pan's Labyrinth, he's also equally skillful in storytelling. Believe me Pan's Labyrinth is as twisted a simple fairytale can get. But he's had his fair share of hit and misses as well *cough* Don't be Afraid of the Dark *cough*. You know he's a good director when Peter Jackson himself chose Guilermo for directing The Hobbit trilogy. Unfortunately The Hobbit landed back in the hands of its own foster father than a step-dad. Its been 5 years since Guilermo's directed a movie. People thought he'd make a comeback with Hellboy but what came a surprise was Pacific Rim. First Look at its previews made me think ""oh yea, another Transformers clone"" but I was direly wrong. Pacific Rim is more than Michael Bay's Transformers, more than just an homage to Robots Vs Monsters movies as well.Pacific Rim is a nothing but glorified Power Rangers for adults movie, but it nevertheless entertain you. Basically its human-built giant robots, Jaegars, against giant alien monsters, Kaiju. What ensures is a huge huge robot on monster action with some drama sprinkled over the top. Pacific Rim, as soon as it starts puts you in the thick of action and clocking in at 132 minutes there was never a boring sequence. The writing was exactly what you'd expect in this genre. The lines were forced and at times very very clichÃ©d but admit it you were neither in for performances or a plotÂyou were in for giant monsters vs giant robots and u get served pretty damn well and hot. The Drift was an interesting mechanic that serves as the backbone for the movie. Was a bit let down when other Jaegars didn't get enough screen-time as Gypsy Danger. Would have died to see the Russian one go a bit more. Most of the Kaiju encounters takes place at night and watching the movie in 3D felt a bit tedious as it was super dark I would have loved it if there was at least one head to head Kaiju fight in broad daylight. Then again the fight sequences were insanely detailed much much more than Transformers where we could only see blurs and metal scraps. Here in Pacific Rim each punch, each blow the Kaiju and Jaegers delivered was felt with equal force.Pacific Rim doesn't have a star-studded cast and it doesn't need one when the the plot is focused on Jaegars and Kaijus. Idris Elba had always stood out be it whatever roles he was in. He plays Stacker Pentecost and his sheer flamboyance does an amazing job here as well. I was particularly impressed with his ""Do not let my calm demeanour fool you, ranger!"" line. Rinko Kikuchi, as Mako Mari was good. I'd loved her in The Brothers Bloom where she delivered a solid performance without uttering a word. Her backstory here was touching, have to give kudos to the kid who played little Mako as well. It struck to me as vaguely similar to the Kim Phuc photo during the Viatnamese War. Comic relief by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman were good, it sometimes felt as cheesy but it was integral in this genre of movies. Guilermo's favorite Ron Perlman does a short role by name Hannibal Chau serving some chuckles. I was disappointed with the inadequate performance from the lead, Charlie Hunnam. Of course I've heard people saying his resemblance with Tron Legacy's Sam Flynn but thats just where the resemblances end. I just couldn't buy into his performance.Of course the real stars of Pacific Rim were the Jaegars and Kaiju and both were exquisitely detailed. Guillermo was never a stranger to monster designs, evident from some of the Hellboy and Pan Labyrinth monsters designed by himself.The Kaiju felt like intimidating hulking beasts of pure destruction and chaos and most of them modeled on monsterized versions of a shark, a gorilla etc. Loved them.Ramin Djawadi's score is pure spellbinding. I need not give an example more than Game of Throne's booming score. He does his magic again here with Pacific Rim. His score with the awesome visuals is enough to induce goosebumps. It leaves us in awe and beckons to be heard again and again. Tracks like 'Pacific Rim' and 'Gipsy Danger' is pure awesomeness.Pacific Rim is undoubtedly flawed in writing, performances and plot but it what it lacks there, it makes up with style, action and thrills. Pacific Rim isn't even close to Guillermo's Pan's Labyrinth or Hellboy in terms of storytelling but it excites you and it does give you an adrenaline rush watching the action packed fights and its more than any fanboy could ask for. Summer movies cant get any BIGGER than this. Go watch it at the movies now!","

"neil-476","19 July 2013","Giant monsters are rising from below the sea, and huge robots driven by pairs of human pilots are constructed in order to fight them. This film - a straightforward blend of Godzilla, Cloverfield, Transformers and Independence Day, with a cheerful disregard for anything approximating the laws of physics - contained a number of elements which made me wrinkle my brow quizzically, and much which I liked a lot. It didn't have anything I outright disliked.So what made me grimace? One, I thought Idris Elba's character was very badly conceived: an individual in that situation would never blow so hot and cold. Two, the caucasian young men heroes were interchangeable: I couldn't tell one from another. They looked the same and acted the same. Three, in this digital age, I didn't find the vast mechanical linkages in the Jaegers credible - surely there would be some digital body suit? Four, the comedy relief scientists were incredibly annoying.On the other hand, I very much liked the way this film started as if it were the second in a series, with a recap of the origin movie given as a brief voice-over at the start. I liked Rinko Kikuchi's quiet intensity as Mako, and I loved her flashback sequence with the phenomenal young Mana Ashida as young Mako. And, as successor to the Japanese Godzilla movies of the 50s and 60s wherein men in rubber costumes had slo-mo punch-ups in model cities, the movie has spectacular visual effects in which the giant action is completely credible. The whole thing is done with incredible slickness and modest likability. So get out the popcorn, put on the 3D specs, and enjoy 2 hours of giant monsters and robots beating the bejeebers out of each other. And you don't need to get your brain involved in the slightest!","

"Scene13","31 July 2013","I didn't know what to expect with this film. I thought it was likely to be a chain of high quality and highly explosive combat scenes linked together by a weak plot. Having thoroughly enjoyed some of Guillermo del Toro previous works (Pans Labrynth, Cronos and Devils Backbone) and knowing of his love for and skill in ""designing?"" Monsters and Insect type characters, I was intrigued to see what he would offer in Pacific Rim. I was not disappointed!The Good Points1) Plot: This film had a strong and believable plot line as long as you can get your head around a portal between dimensions, luckily i can. Kaiju pass through a portal between two dimensions and attack Earth. The world unites and design epic transformer like Robots (Jaeger) to fight the Monsters. Some f**king genius has the idea of building a big wall(...idiot) and pull funding from Jaeger projects. Wall fails, the heavily diminished Jaeger project is all that's left to save humanity. whats not to like?2) Visuals: Overall the graphics in this film were great. Realistic.3) Robots (Jaeger): The Jaeger were awesome. It was great to see that there were many models of Jaeger and it was developed over time. This helped make them realistic and believable. The Mind Drift control system was clever as well. I thought it was a very original idea.4) Monsters (Kaiju): I think Guillermo del Toro must have been like a kid in a candy store designing the Kaiju. each one was different. Some adapted for water, Land and even the Air. They had different attacking capabilities, brute force, teeth, spitting acid just to name a view. 5) Humorous Scientists and let's not forget the Dodgy Dealer: Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) a biologist studying the Kaiju. H must have been the only scientist ever to study the Kaiju as he seemed to only be finding out things that were fairly obvious to investigate. It seemed unlikely that he was the first scientist in however long the Kaiju had been attacking the earth to compare two Kaiju DNA samples. Even though perhaps the scientist was a bit slow at finding scientific breakthroughs he did have a good rivalry with Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) a physicist. There rivalry was amusing and was full of light hearted banter i enjoyed the scenes with these characters in. The Black Market ""dodgy dealer"" Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman) also provided some light hearted entertainment in the mix of all this devastation. I really liked these three characters possible more than the main characters of the film.The Bad Points1) Character Development: I don't need to know the in depth back story of all the characters to route for them to save the world. The back story of the characters was not what this film was about. It felt like the film was trying to force the characters back story down my throat. Probably as a result of undertaking a highly ambitious task of telling this story in 131minutes that the character development seemed weak, rushed and it may have been better if they had just left it out. 2) Love: All i can say is at least it didn't end on a kiss.... i was so convinced it was going too! This is one film where i didn't think they needed to right in the ""love"" it would have been just as good if Rayleigh (Charlie Hunnam) and Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) were just partners/friends.and if I'mm being really picky:3) Saving the boat!Really? what about all the demolition caused when there on land!: So in the opening scenes a Kaiju appears and and the Raleigh and his brother Yancy to ""soldiers"" are sent out in the ocean in there Jaeger to exterminate it. They are given strict instructions of what to do and this included leaving a ship of ten fisherman in the water near the fight. They do not listen and help the fisherman out of the way with there Jaeger before attacking the Kaiju. At first i thought "" How considerate and nice to help them out"". Later on in the film there are lots of highly destructive fights on the land and none of the Jaegers, try to assist any stranded people within the buildings and vehicles... this just made the first scene an unrealistic plot device, they would never have risked a in demand and highly expensive Jaeger to save such a few people especially with the added risk it would cause.Pacific Rim is what happens when Maximus Prime and Godzilla have a fun night in the sack! It's awesome, It's epic, It's explosive and yet still realistic. Flowed at a fast pace throughout and thankfully then ending didn't feel rushed! Watch it see what you think!","

"slicedbread117","22 December 2013","Giant robots versus giant alien sea monsters. What more could a geek ask for? Pacific Rim looked exciting right from the first trailer, aiming to unleash the action nerd in all of us. While there are some fumbles along the way, Pacific Rim succeeds in bringing larger-than-life action to the big screen.One of the first things you notice about Pacific Rim is the outstanding CGI. The visuals are at a top tier quality, some of the best I've ever seen in film. The fictional Kaiju race of aliens are brought to life along with their formidable foes, the human built Jaegers, through eye- popping CGI that really helps set the tone for what this movie is all about: gigantic action. Pacific Rim does not falter in delivering some of the biggest action scenes in recent time. The battles between the Jaegers and Kaiju just keep getting bigger, badder, and more epic as the movie goes on. The sheer scale of these monster battles is large enough to put even a movie like Transformers to shame. Mastermind Guillermo del Torro is in the directors chair for this film, and his vision to create a large-scale, CGI glorified action film is executed very well. The action sequences are gargantuan, and are highly entertaining to say the least.Where Pacific Rim thrives most is on the battlefield, focusing all of its attention on the clashes between the Jaegers and Kaiju. Where the movie falters is during the non-action scenes where it tries to tell an engaging story with characters you care about. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of action in this film, but too often does the movie stray away from the epic battles and tries to tell a smaller story inside this massive conflict, and it at times slows the movie down, nearly to a screeching halt. The plot is pretty straightforward, and while it has its short comings and clichÃ©s, it's good enough to be entertaining and at the same time not complete non-sense. Again, this is an action heavy movie, and when Pacific Rim gets too far away from that, it starts to show some of its weaknesses.The cast does an OK job, with the better performances coming from Idris Elba and Charlie Hunnam as Stacker Pentecost and Raleigh Becket respectively. Charlie Day, one of my personal favorite actors, and best known for his work on It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, provides comedic relief but doesn't quite fit the bill for this movie and his character seemed almost annoying at times. Rinko Kikuchi plays Mako Mori, and her performance was far and away the worst of any of the cast members, showing almost no emotion in her acting. Overall the cast was mediocre only adding a more human element to the sort of monster vs. monster theme.It won't keep you emotionally attached, it won't get you deep into its story, and it won't make you care for the small stories outside of the action. But what Pacific Rim will do, is provide exhilarating action sequences supplemented by stunning CGI and keep you largely entertained by the super-sized battles that only get bigger and better as the movie progresses. 8/10","

"EvilMissQB","29 July 2013","Before going to see Pacific Rim I had read quite a few mixed reviews. I really was sort of ambivalent about going to see it, even though I am quite fond of big action and monsters.We opted to see it in IMAX 3D, which got a thumbs down from me (3D films should be filmed in 3D to really pull it off. Conversions are just weird in my opinion) but others in my group thought it really enhanced the action so use your own discretion.After sitting through the movie, I have to ask... ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE??"" I can't for the life of me figure out how folks could have issues with the movie. I thought it was a brilliant homage to the Godzilla movies of yore with a healthy dash of the fun of Anime robots but beautifully filmed and well acted by everyone involved. This is precisely what a summer popcorn movie is supposed to be. Just all kinds of exciting.The action might be too much for the under 10 kiddos. I don't recall any excessive use of language or inappropriate sexual situations.","

Producers need to spend more money on the WRITING of a movie than the Computer graphics. In the 1980's movies were better because it was all in the writing, and there wasn't much computer editing. The writing was more important than the Acting, also.If there's a movie you don't like, it's mainly because of bad writing, I don't care how much computer graphics is spent on it, it will be lousy, like this movie!!","

"Turfseer","5 December 2013","'Pacific Rim', noted director Guillermo Del Toro's attempt to update the old Japanese Godzilla monster genre, can best be described as a colossal waste of money. The setting is a decade from now. The monsters, called Kaiijus, have escaped from an inter-dimensional rift on the ocean floor and wreak havoc all over earth. In response, mankind have developed Jaegers, giant humanoid contraptions, piloted by two humans, who work in tandem via a mind meld of sorts. We're introduced to Raleigh Becket, a former Jaeger pilot who lost his brother while they were battling one of the Kaiijus a few years before. Becket is called out of retirement as the commander of the Jaegers, Stacker Pentecost, believes he's the best for the job.Right off the bat, the plot makes little sense. The Jaeger program is discontinued as the giant machines are no match for the overpowering Kaiijus. Instead, the powers that be decide to construct giant walls to protect earth's population from the monsters. The only problem is that the walls are completely flimsy and collapse after the first Kaiiju attack. Why then did they believe the walls would work at all? Despite the order to discontinue the Jaeger program, Pentecost seeks to throw one last 'Hail Mary' by dropping a thermonuclear bomb into the rift, cutting off the Kaiiju's portal to earth. Instead of simply showing one big monster battle after another, most of Act II involves finding a new partner for Becket. He ends up with Mako Mori, a Japanese director of a Jaeger refurbishment project, who also happens to be Pentecost's adopted daughter. Mori wants to team up with Becket, but her over protective parent, Pentecost, is against it. Mori almost blows her chance when memories of a Kaiiju killing her parents interferes with the mind meld with Becket, causing the Jaeger they're testing, to go berserk. If this isn't enough, there's also a sub-plot concerning two scientists, one of whom, Geiszler, establishes a mental link with the Kaiiju brain. He goes to Hong Kong where he meets up with Chau, played by an over the top Ron Perlman, who is a black market dealer in Kaiiju body parts. Keiszler figures out that the good guys can only gain access to the portal if the Kaiiju recognize their own DNA.No need to rehash the rest of the plot. It's pretty obvious that the good guys manage to drop the bomb into the portal and cut off the Kaiiju access. Of course there's a whole bunch of boring Monster-Humanoid battle scenes before that, probably most enjoyed by aficionados of violent video games.Pacific Rim didn't do that well at the box office here in the US but cleaned up overseas. Casting pretty Japanese Rinko Kakuchi as the co-star was a brilliant casting move, which undoubtedly had a lot to do with the film's success in the Asian market. In the end, Pacific Rim is a pointless attempt to update the Godzilla genre. The action sequences are repetitious and the human drama is stilted and predictable. The only thing I enjoyed in the entire film is when Ron Perlman cuts himself out of the baby Kaiiju, during the post-credit sequence. That at least WAS amusing!","

"jackdice","13 July 2013","A movie that could have been great if not for the obvious flaws that drag it down. Let me break it down by sections:Story, Screenplay & Dialogues: A very promising premise that promises much more than if actually offers on screen. A razor straight story line that does not deviate from the obvious and every scene follows a predictable path. Offers no surprises, thrills, twists or turns. A scrappy screenplay only serves to drag the pace, especially in action sequences...where you are itching for the mega fights only to be let down. The director tries Chris Nolan / Inception'esque trip down memory lanes, only to falter without generating any emotion from the audience. Absolutely horrendous dialogue. Completely uninspiring. Scenes where a single look should have conveyed the emotion powerfully has been diluted with meaningless words. More worse as the viewer can even predict what is going to be said!Action & Animation: Very good, but could have been much much better. More slo-mo sequences wherein you can have a classic view of the behemoths colliding are missing trying to generate pace, but does not reach its mark. Most sequences happen in night/underwater adding to a jumbled rumble feel.Characters: Tame and insipid. lack of character development leaves the viewers emotionally detached and not able to 'connect' with any of the characters. Notable exceptions are Elba and Pellman. Both the lead characters are eminently forgettable and do not make a impact. Director should have watched Independence day or MiB to understand the importance of character development. A leaf out of Real Steel would have lifted this to greatness.Overall: Still a good movie. Watchable once with minimal repeat value. The Jaegers are awesome and just for that I rate this 7/10.","

"brutorres","9 May 2020","The best film I've seen about giants robots.
The fights, violence, sounds and feeling about the weight of the Jaegers it's incredible, Del Toro is an hell of director!
I've loved the fact that the film it's not just about giants robots and monsters but even the plot it's great!Another thing incredible about the film it's the CGI, this movie seems from 2030, it's insane!It takes some inspirations in Evangelion, so if you love the anime you must see it.","

"pec_on_me","16 July 2013","Just saw Pacific Rim last Saturday and my verdict disappointed. Here's why first of all we know the kaijus don't attack earth very frequently and biggest kaiju which is say category 5 is like 40 storeys tall the world has enough weapons be it artillery or bombers to destroy a whole city block easy.So killing each kaiju every time they show up should be a piece of cake(Its like we just gave up). Remember Godzilla(Same Size)..the military killed it like in a day..Second. Its just another fight in the city and building collapsing. Third the only so called epic battle scene was the one in Hong Kong where Gypsy Danger hit one of the kaiju with an oil tanker, but that lasted like 40 secs. Three. I thought the Russian and the Chinese robots will show off some killer fight sequence but they all died the moment the step their feet in the sea(whats up with that). Fourthly Edris Elba's character. I thought he had enough war experience that the movie had something installed for the end so that he has a glorious death as a symbol of resilience but meh...nothing there too...there was hardly any fight and he self detonated even before a real fight began...Finally why do they always fight during the night I couldn't even make make whats what..between..monsters...the metal and the city ruins..So on in all.. This was a big disappointment... whats next since the monsters are gone..do we all live in peace???","

"hthbrr2","13 October 2013","WARNING spoilers!Wtf? Really? But seriously though, how was this movie made? I mean was it based on some well liked series of books, comic books, TV series, anything? From the looks of it no.They just made it up, and boy does it show. The plot makes 0 sense. The acting is TERRIBLE and the ending is confusing.Really the whole story make no sense. Why these monsters are here, why they are called certain things, why the suits are different, etc. The only stable thing was this supposed relationship between The main male character and the main female character.But that went no where. As with all other things in this movie it fizzled out. When she first saw him, she was all blushing and such. And he would give a grin or two. But the last scene they did not even kiss as you would expect. Yes, it would have been clichÃ©. And they did show some control for not going for that 'We're alive let's kiss' thing. But in a movie that follows every OTHER clichÃ© (there is only 1 man 4 the job, opposites attract, we gotta work 2gether, etc.) why not do the one that ppl actually ENJOY!?I suppose that would mess with the girls story and sort of reduce her to a physical object. But it does that ANYWAYS with the whole 'don't let her fight cuz she's a girl' thing! I was really let down there was not even a kiss. I mean don't build up a romance and then lead it to friendship. Really they hugged at the end? Why was she all checking his ripped body out earlier in the movie? What were those googly eyes she had for him when she first met him? Why did he keep sticking up for here even though he KNEW she was not ready? They liked each other. The no kiss ending was sad. Either she is the sad puppy dog. Or he just does not see her in that way. Or perhaps they left this to be explored in the *shudders* sequel.Which leads me to my main point how in the hell was this big-budget Hollywood movie even made? How? WHO approved it? WHO? Some guy had a random idea and they just said yes? WHAT? So many great movie ideas out there and they chose THIS!? Sad that a movie devoid of all good qualities gets made. Bad acting? Check. Non-sense making plot? Check. Nothing gets paid off? Check. I mean really I would go into detail about how many things make no sense in this move but many b4 me have already done that. Basically this movie is a half-@$$ed effort of mashing several movies into 1. Action/CGI/Comedy/Romance/Mystery/SciFic/Drama. But just like in cooking when you throw too many ingredients into a dish it is no longer delicious but confusing as all the elements struggle for your attention. It tries to be everything and ends up as nothing due to general laziness on Hollywood's part for not demanding better quality movies. I only watched this in desperation to see a new movie. I guess when it's the only game in town ppl see it. How sad.","

"carantula2010","16 April 2014","I'm not sure how i finished this movie. But i did, and i want my life time back. I had fun in the first 10 minutes or so, but after that just downhill.Its a awful movie. Boring and stupid.There's this character: Mako. She wants to be a Jaeger pilot (or maybe not, she is so strange that is hard to tell). Then the movie goes like this:Mako: I want to be a pilot. Pentecost: No, you cannot. You taking things too personally. Mako: OK. But can i be a pilot? Pentecost: No. Mako: Please. Pentecost: No. Mako: Please. Pentecost: No way, bi...h! Shut your mouth. (So, a little later) Pentecost: You can be a pilot, i was just kidding. Give me some sugar, girl.Well, the dialogs wasn't exactly like i described, but wasn't so different either. Believe me, good part of the movie is about Mako wanting to be a pilot (or maybe not) and Pentecost keeping her from it. And then allowing her to be a pilot out of the blue.Interesting aspect of Pentecost explanation about why Mako shouldn't be a pilot was that she had personal reasons and that would be a problem. Like this aliens are destroying the entire planet, but Mako was the only one with personal issues with that? Strange, right? At that point everyone there should have personal issues with the Kaijus, its just common sense.There a lot of problemas with every character. And the acting isn't very good as well. The plot was terrible, not even worth to mention.I was expecting to witness great effects. Well, they're great. But dumb. The Kaijus weren't very convincing, too fast, too flashy, too boring. I started to miss the little Japanese girls inside rubber costumes (way better and more fun to see). So, the movie is full of flaws. Its boring. Has more defects than i could list. Sorry my bad English. Its not my main idiom, but i love it.","

"jihun-lee0526","16 July 2013","I went into the theater expecting to see a cartoon for adults and that is exactly what I paid for.Guillermo Del Toro is an extremely talented director, producer and above all an extraordinary artist. Pan's Labyrinth gave justice to his talents and ""The Strain trilogy"" exemplifies his talents as a creator and innovator of interesting mind-grabbing stories/plots.However, Pacific Rim was a horrible movie not only because it lacked substance (a clear plot, climax, resolution), but because it proved to audiences everywhere that Hollywood no longer requires decent actors and plot-lines to create a blockbuster movie.The only intricacies and attention to detail that could be found in this movie was in the CG design of the so called Jaegers (Robots). Yet, the movie served to ignore the basic human sense of sight when most of the movie took place in a dark setting. It was a metaphor of how the movie itself was a black hole of cash and talent with all the darkness sucking and robbing people of their investments and experiences.An episode of Beast Wars that I watched as a young child had more substance and gave more satisfaction to its audience than this movie. Pacific Rim is a destruction to the art of cinematography in that its business model lies in providing the awe-factor, shocking the audience into believing the movie is great with bling. Expensive jewelry doesn't make a woman more beautiful, it just proves that she has the money to afford it, and that is exactly what Pacific Rim accomplished.The movie is just a failure of epic proportions and the fact that it rates a 7.9 on IMDb just proves that we, the collective audience, have just stopped caring. Movies no longer provide us with mind-blowing catharsis, they are now just a means of blowing off steam.","

"vaultoverseer_15","18 April 2018","Guillermo Del Toro is one of my favourite directors of all time, and for good reason. His films always feel so imaginative, his world building and designs so impressive. He knows how to build everything to create his own vision. Pacific Rim sounds like a stupid concept at first, and while the movie is dumb, it knows how seriously to take itself. Unlike the transformers movies which need to convince the audience that the movie is dark and gritty, this movie has fun, with vibrant colours and fun characters. These characters are not original or very unique but their fun tropes, like Star Wars characters. In fact, I am surprised so many dislike these characters but then love Star Wars. It's probably due to the development of these characters, but I think everyone is fleshed out as much as they need to be. People consider this a modern Star Wars, and I would have to agree with it. It uses other sources and cliches mixed together to create its unique universe like Star Wars does. This universe doesn't sound so unique, I mean tecchnically theres just giant robots and kaijus now, but all the details Del Toro puts into the universe elevates this world. Guillermo Del Toro of course knows how to deal with special effects, but I was anticipating ths movie due to budget, as Del Toro doesn't typically get a big blockbuster budget, even in the Hellboy movies. This movie looks beautiful, with a wide variety of locations. Again, this is so colourful compared to most blockbusters. This colour makes the film interesting to look at. The inside of the Jaegers, the different Kaijus and the look of the Shatterdome, Hong Kong and the rift are beautiful, I haven't talked about the action, mostly because surpisingly there isn't a lot in the film, which is what I love. In fact, there are only 3 fights in the movie, the first one not really even counting as a fight, more as an introduction. The 2nd set piece, which I will not spoil to anyone, is by far the highlight of the film. One thing that sets this movie apart from others is the action itself. The Jaegers aren't fast Michael Bay robots, they are slow, and so are they Kaijus. This, combined with the water that is always in these action scenes as rain or waves, gives this feeling of impact by seeing the robots slowly smash water particles rather than zoom across the screen just to look cool. This feeling of scale is just awesome, established in each shot, always making sure the Jaegers feel huge.Pacific Rim is a movie unlike so many blockbusters these days which try to give off this fake seriousness that the movie doesn't need. I wish more movies were like this, and more directors were as talented as Guillermo Del Toro.","

"ilikeimdb","7 January 2014","The similarities between Pacific Rim and Sharknado go far beyond their lithe, telegenic screenplays and nuanced character-driven plots. Practically Shakespearean in their world-views and intricate family dynamics, both movies will keep you on the edge of your seat as plot twists have you guessing right up until the end on the big ""who done it"" question. Oh certainly, first-rate special effects added to well-crafted acting with so many layers of emotional depth you'd think its respective sea creatures were pipe-lined straight from Citizen Kane, or perhaps The Godfather, or maybe a bit of both. Really, who's to say which picture will garner the most Golden Globes or Academy Awards this year. My bet's on ILM's splendorous work in Pacific Rim although I've got to say Sharknado's sharks really projected tremendous amounts of fear-inducing horror that weren't quite the equal of the more anime-inflected denizens of Pacific Rim. I suggest you see both films in a double feature and decide for yourself.","

"3xHCCH","11 July 2013","I was so ready not to like ""Pacific Rim"". It seemed just like another one of those ""giant robot movies that are just all noise and nothing else. Fortunately though, it was a good thing that it was the only movie beginning when I got to the mall this morning. This is so much better than the ""Transformers"" clone I was afraid it would be.""Pacific Rim"" takes place in the year 2020 (not really in the very far future, isn't it?) and the world is under attack from gigantic monsters coming from ocean depths called Kaiju. As the tag line tells us, ""to fight the monsters, we created monsters of our own."" These are in the form of so-called giant mechanical fighting soldiers called Jaegers, controlled by the skills of human controllers. The human team dedicated to fighting these destructive creatures are based in Hong Kong. The soldiers were all hot-headed and macho heroic types, led by Stacker (Idris Elba). The scientists were portrayed as nerdy and caricature-ish comic relief, led by Dr. Newton (Charlie Day). The central character is Raleigh Becket, who previously retired from the Jaegers when his brother and partner died in battle. He was portrayed by Charlie Hunnam, who was not too familiar to me, just another generic blonde Hollywood hunk. The face could have been interchangeable with any of the other Caucasian fighters in there. The lead female character is Mako Mori, an aspiring Jaeger fighter, with a painful past. She is portrayed by Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi, who we should remember was nominated for Best Supporting Actress back in 2006 for her role in ""Babel"". Here, she appeared to be confused on how to properly portray her role, so she did not come across too strongly as her character should have beenDespite these casting and characterization flaws though, the movie as a whole still turned out very well. Director Guillermo del Toro faced such a challenge to execute a script that dangerously flirted with disaster, deriving obvious comparisons with, not only ""Transformers,"" but also ""Godzilla"", ""Real Steel"", ""Armageddon"". He succeeded to create within this borrowed material enough heart to make audiences root for the good guys and care if they save the day or not. When I was watching as the movie went along, it did matter too much anymore that the acting was not too good, or that the scenes looked familiar, or that the lines get corny. The movie was actually engrossing and entertaining. The special effects were of epic proportions. The whole thing worked as a whole, and that is what matters in the end.","

"Drewgarden","19 July 2013","I thought to myself ""giant monsters beaming themselves into the pacific, fighting giant robots, what could be wrong with that?"" And the answer is, quite a bit...quite....a....bit.I'll start with what del Toro has done well here, he's created some incredible sets, I mean these sets are enormous, and he's used CGI to make these hangers and workshops every bit as jaw dropping as you'd hope if the world had really pooled its resources in such a way. If only your favorite nerd sci fi TV show had this budget. There are some great scenes, great stills. And for the effort here, and for the balls to make such a movie, I'm giving this a pass. 5 out of 10.From about the 2 minute mark, or very early on at least, the movie pretty much tells you what kind of movie you are are about to watch, for the next 2.4 hours of your life. Firstly it's a movie with no real people in it. The authorities in this world must be incredibly stupid for a start, who are wanting to abandon the fighting machine project in favor of building sea walls. After 25 seconds of this movie we know that his insane, and that here we are dealing with a 12 year old world in which the authorities are pretty much no smarter than your stupid parents. The good guys, the warriors, are unfortunately no smarter, despite all the cool things they've surrounded them selves with, and have the emotional intelligence of wookies. These characters are so clichÃ©d and predictable you want to slap them all every time you see them. A movie like Starship Troopers is Hamlet compared to this screenplay.Beyond this, the only remotely interesting thing is watching the fight scenes and the monsters trash the cities. But I venture that despite the huge budget thrown at it, even this does not deliver. To make the monsters continually more scary del Toro relies more and mo on CGI throughout, and so they become less and less real. For all their size and fury, they are far far far less scary than the monster from Cloverrfield, to pick a random monster comparison. And the fight scenes, really start to get boring, and the end is merciful indeed.All in all, the question is ""how can a 170 million dollar budget result in something so unsatisfactory?"". This movie is terribly out of proportion, a movie from the mind of a child, and the budget of Apple, it isn't good, it's not art, it's barely entertainment.","

"phantom-20","22 July 2013","Just got back from seeing ""Pacific Rim"" and my worst fears about this movie have come to fruition! I was disappointed and underwhelmed! I wanted to like it, I really did and I really tried, but in the end I thought it was an O.K. movie that should have been and could have been great. While a cool concept and story, I thought the script was incredibly derivative and saw everything and every clichÃ© coming a mile away. To me, the films biggest sins though are: THE MONSTERS â I thought the designs were bland, unimaginative, uninteresting and unmemorable. Can't remember what they looked like after I left the theater. THE ACTION â Every piece of action in this movie was shot and edited horribly! Horrendous stuffÂUnforgivable! More weasel on acid cam, more editing by a meth addict on speed, everything I have come to expect, hate and dread in the movies of the last 10 years. To spend most of your budget on special effects and not let your audience get a good look at things is wasteful and frustrating! You could have shot robot puppets on strings, whip panned all over the place and cut it like a coke fiend and saved 99 million bucks! I think that ""Robot Jox"" (Which was made for around 140 million less), was a much better and enjoyable giant robot flick, where you actually get to see what is going on!. I think I'll watch it tonight to get the bad taste of ""Pacific Rim Job"" out of my mouth!","

"lucas739","25 October 2013","There are only two angles to review this film from.First is as a preschooler, possibly able to eat solids and potty trained (this is the demographic i hope the film was aimed at).From this diminutive position the whole feature will be lots of flashing lights and creatures and robots and planes and stuff...wow. To anyone else, anyone with half a brain, anyone who can use the big toilet will see this for the steaming pile of vacuity it really is.It felt like brain rape sitting through it. The only way i could endure such utter garbage was to hold a cabbage to the side of my head and try to master 'drifting' with it.The cabbage, with its iQ of zero, couldn't take more than 10 minutes before it got up, declared it to be an abomination and left. As a 2+ hour advert for the forthcoming Jaeger toy range it was a complete success but peel away the gossamer veneer of a story and you'll find nothing of any real substance, nothing at all. I find it staggering that it has a IMDb rating of over 7. It is a damning indictment of how low our expectation levels have fallen. Move on, nothing to see here.","

"s_campanale","13 August 2013","I admit I've been very excited about this movie since the first posters & trailers appeared, mainly because I am coming at it from a similar place to Del Toro himself, someone who grew up loving the classic Japanese ""Mecha-Anime"" series which were bigger than God back in the 70s and 80s in Italy, Spain and other Latin countries (and who is also a big fan of their forbears, the ""man in a monster suit"" Kaiju films). That someone was attempting to make a live action summer blockbuster film based on them was exciting enough, but when that man was the great visionary Del Toro himself, then something really special seemed on the cards.Of course expectations had to be dampened down, and wisely so. The film's biggest flaw is the plot. In condensing a typical anime series into 2hrs 11 minutes you have to concentrate on just the bare basics, and that makes for a very generic, seen it all before outline. Gone are most of the little sub-plots and character dynamics which gave the originals their quiet poetry, philosophy, humour and tragedy, and in their place is the standard ""maverick rejected by others âpissing contest-learning to work together-taking the enemy down with desperate last plan"" arc. If you're familiar with the originals then you can pretty much mentally fill in the blanks. If you're not then it's going to look very thin and underwhelming. It reminded me a lot of 1999's ""Wing Commander"", another retro-styled cheap and cheerful cheesefest.The cast is also made up of genre archetypes â the lone maverick hero (Hunmann) the traumatised heroine desperate to prove herself and take revenge (Kikuchi), the arrogant jock who doesn't want the lone maverick on the team (Kazinsky) The aloof father figure head of operations (Elba) the pair of comedy bickering scientists (Day and Gorman) and the comical gangster (Perlman) â people who you would never in a million years imagine, nor want, as humanities last line of defence, but who somehow end up that way. In cartoon form it just about works, but in making them flesh and blood, the illusion is totally shattered. The actors, who apart from Elba, Perlman (and Spanish comedian Santiago Segura making another cameo for Del Toro as Perlman's henchman) are largely unknowns, do what they can, but there seems something deliberately false and forced about the acting, as if Del Toro was going for cheese knowingly, a tongue firmly in cheek, always a tricky route to take. The dialogue, which again apes that of the originals, comes off as rather silly, and Elba's grand rousing pre-battle speech sounds just daft.Kikuchi's traumatic flashbacks to her experience as a child facing an early monster in Tokyo, and her rescue by a young Elba, are a rare but welcome bit of ""depth"" from the originals and in Del Toro's hands comes off very effectively. Similarly the comic side-route by the scientists to find parts of a monster brain to meld with by way of comedy gangster Perlman are funny and welcome.The film borrows liberally from various series, both anime and live- action ""Kaiju"", both in plot and look. The main story seems borrowed from the classic Getter Robot, in which an underground civilization of fully evolved dinosaurs attempts to take back Earth from newcomers Man by way of huge hybrid dinosaur-cyborg monsters called ""Mecha-Zaus"" which spring up from below the ocean to strike a will. The mythology has been slightly rejigged, and a ""dimensional breech"" idea invented to fill in the obvious credibility gap of having an underground kingdom near the Earth's core. We see a few glimpses of these creatures, and of the monster-building process, but they are totally absent as characters, and so the story suffers. Part of the fun of the originals was having an enemy team, often back-stabbing and infighting for influence among themselves throughout the series course, but here they are unseen, and the Mecha-Zaus just crazed beasts. Other plot elements are borrowed from different series, as are the looks of the ""Jaeger"" robots. The main robot is modelled on the classic Tetsujin-28 (Del Toro's favourite) while the Australian and Chinese robots take their inspiration from the later Macross series, and the heavy tank like Russian robot seems an ode to similar battle suits in ""Gundam"". The piloting process is also updated, with a neuro-link called ""drifting"" whereby two become-one with the robot, and their body movements match up those of the robots. Similar ideas where floated in the originals, with an almost mystical link between pilot and machine, but most controlling was done by pulling various levers around, so this is an improvement on that. It also provides a vital plot point during the second act.The Kaiju/Mecha-Zaus are also varied (the originals had special teams who worked on creating different enemy monsters/robots every episode) with dragon, gorilla, swordfish, tortoise, alligator and lobster inspired creatures. Each is given a Japanese codename, but sadly their names do not flash up beneath them in Japanese script when they first appear as they did in the originals! The fights are rough and violent, and battle winning weapons are only taken out at the last second for dramatic effect (as in the series) while superficial damage and anguish is visited upon the pilots. Many of the robots shown in posters never appear, while the Russian and Chinese robots, though really built up, are destroyed in seconds in an anti-climactic way.In many ways this, like earlier live-action anime ""Speed Racer"", was never going to be a big winner, but rather a labour of love to and for a certain crowd. For the non anime/kaiju fan, it can still be a very fun night out, with great effects (The 3D is really used here) a few laughs, light tragedy and plenty of action which mercifully doesn't take itself too seriously. Don't expect too much and you should be entertained.","

"Sergeant_Tibbs","16 July 2013","Despite a few too many Guillermo del Toro fantasy movies leaving me cold, particularly with the overrated Pan's Labyrinth, for some reason, I had hope that Pacific Rim would be my Summer hit of the year. It's felt too much like there's not been anything genuine to be excited about with Iron Man 3, Man Of Steel, World War Z and The Lone Ranger to name a few, not satisfying audiences. Although I'm not a fan of Transformers or the other monster movies that are obvious influences, I had hope that Del Toro's art-house sense of cinema would blend well with the Hollywood inevitable attributes, as the latter is the price to pay for a movie of this epic scale. I enjoyed Hellboy back in the day but sometimes it got a little too dark and serious to be fun whereas Pacific Rim looked like a ball from start to finish. And it most certainly is. While too many Summer movies of the last decade find themselves swallowed up by their paint-by- numbers plot with any random thing filling in the gaps, Pacific Rim finds a great balance between the plot and the characters' stories, helped by its talented cast plucked from TV, especially Charlie Hunnam and Charlie Day, my personal favourite.Its script is constantly surprising and intriguing, even if structurally predictable, and it sets up its world in a fascinating way in those first few minutes. Although it can be melodramatic, whenever it dragged it picked itself back up again and set the stakes back in motion. It's an absolute delight to have a movie with actual set-pieces to balance out with the all-CGI world too, I just love the inside the Jaeger set. However, admittedly, there are times when the action is frustratingly cluttered, it has awesome and truly involving moments that completely make up for those moments of confusion. A scale like this hasn't been touched since The Lord Of The Rings and here it's is utterly awe-spiring. But what makes it special is that the action always means something to the characters and the plot and is never there for the sake of banal excitement. It has a great sense of humour too though sometimes it can be a bit too campy but that seems to be the lashings of Del Toro's style. Nevertheless, Pacific Rim is one of the most entertaining blockbusters in a long, long time thanks to its characters, great writing and creative epic special effects. This is how it's done.7/10","

"drjlo","6 January 2015","This movie showcased probably the most awe-inspiring, realistic Mecca special effects I have ever seen. Utterly amazing.Unfortunately, they have also succeeded in making the movie boring, boring, boring. They somehow managed to stuff into this movie pretty much every single Hollywood clichÃ©, character stereotype, utter predictability, unfunny comedy relief, and UN-heart-felt emotion. Despite the stunningly realistic special effects, this movie felt completely fake. Perhaps, many viewers can tolerate fake movies as long as there is compelling suspense and drive to hold one's interest. I am sad to say, this movie presented near zero suspense or drive. It's actually a mystery how the makers of this movie managed to kill off all fun and excitement given the awesome effects available to them. Couple that with the lack of a single compelling character, we have a movie that should have been so much more...","

The amount of detail in the movements and in the scenery is a sight to see. I mean honestly, there isn't a clear use of military guns and tanks that we've all seen before; its all replaced with giant robot fighting that is pretty much new to us.The story? Like all in your face, big bang movies, I do feel it is a little lacking. But...I didn't really need much of a story because I was so glued to the screen.The idea of the whole movie is where I must applaud. Parts of this movie are so well thought out and original its not seen very often. The idea of using 2 pilots to command a robot, now that I think isn't that original...But the idea of neurology, the design of the whole movie, using weaponry different than some grenades and just some bullets....and the way everything looks in the end.I can say that this is going to be a movie I will be eagerly looking for online and on HBO, as this is literally the best giant robot, giant monster, military, fighting movie EVER MADE","

And they all suck.Hunnam has proved that he is a good actor in Sons Of Anarchy, but he seems hell-bent on on disproving that as his performances in the before mentioned movies as well as in Pacific Rim are wooden and bad. No matter what character he plays he always seems to be Jax Teller, with a different name and a different haircut or hair color. He is basically a poor mans Christian Bale.I cant wait for the day Hollywood realize that Pacific Rim (Dumb) and Godzilla (Dumber) based on Japanese anime and japanese movies is not the way to go, when making American movies. Most annoying part: because these movies are based on japanese cartoons and movies, were forced to deal with horrible asian actors to please the asian audience. who in part paid for these movies to be made in America with American actors. Asian actors are annoying, not only is their english inept, but so is their so called acting. This is why they dont make these movies themselves in Japan, because they know their actors suck.Avoid this. Even if viewed as a harmless scifi movie where you check your brain at the door, you will still be annoyed and not entertained by Pacific Rim.
I give 1 star because 0 is not an option.","

"PartialMovieViewer","29 July 2013","Childish flashes of techno doo-doo splashed on screen to make money. What a snore-fest. I even think the robots were boredÂmight want to check their mechanical toes for scuff-marks. Oh â and the acting â what can I say about something that wasn't there? Not much. And not only was talent absent, but the camera work was all over the place. Shaky-shaky is all I can say about the film work. I am probably being too hard on the movie and I might have missed something. Maybe the plot was too deep for me. Just maybe I slept through something. Are you kidding me? There was no plot and absolutely nothing new. With that being said I must be fair. Granted, even if this dribble was plot-less, it was predictable. So much so â that I could have predicted the story without spending a cent. I cannot believe that so much money is dumped into 'B' movies and the producers still clear a profit. Ah well â something is there for someoneÂjust not me. Oops â they got money from me â I take that back.","

"btnthx","11 July 2013","How do you make the perfect summer movie? I'm not just talking about the best action movie, or the best summer comedy, just the perfect summer movie. Some would say lots of explosions, while others may say a good love story will always do the trick. Every year all the studios aim to release a movie that you will want to see, their idea of that great summer movie. Well I think Guillermo del Toro has figured it out, Robots Vs. Monsters.I know it can't be that simple, since we already had a Cowboys and Aliens that didn't live up to expectations, but for me ""Pacific Rim"" really is. We have always looked to the stars for where we thought visitors might arrive on our planet one day. But, what if they come from deep within our oceans? That is the question ""Pacific Rim"" poses. Creatures called ""Kaiju"" have attacked the coastal cities in the Pacific. They start in San Francisco, and then attack cities like Manila, and Cabo. After conventional weapons have little effect, the world's governments decide the only way to fight monsters, is to build monsters of their own. The ""Jaeger Program"" is born, where giant robots are built to fight for mankind. Each Jaeger is controlled by two pilots, who control each hemisphere in the Jaeger. The Jaegers become mankind's best weapon against the ""Kaiju"" and their only way to save the planet. This is what ""Transformers"" could have been, if del Toro had been at the helm instead of Michael Bay. While Bay has always been a visual director, he just does not have the complete package like del Toro. This movie has something for everyone, but above all it is just fun to watch. It is a big and loud, and one of those movies that are made to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. For everything that is wrong with summer movies like ""After Earth"" and ""The Lone Ranger"" this movie gets it right. This is not a movie that is going to get praised for its great story, even though it has a decent one. The main selling point is ""come see this movie and you get to see giant robots and monsters beat the crap out of each other."" I mean really after that what more do you need? I went in expecting to see one of the best movies of the summer and walked out not thinking any different. The performances for the most part are not anything special, except for every time Idris Elba is on the screen. Given the best dialogue, including a speech any football coach would love, Elba just commands your attention. In a world where sequels rule, we should embrace originally. I mean didn't we say all we needed to say with the original ""Grown Ups""? Do we really need another? I say this weekend when you go to the movies see ""Pacific Rim"". It's like sequels are the ""Kaiju"" and this is your chance to command a Jaeger and to tell the world you are tired of all the ""Kaiju"". And if you can, see it 'IMAX' big, because this movie doesn't do anything small.Brian Taylor http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/","

"joebloggscity","30 May 2014","I'm not going to give any summary of the plot line, as much of it is derivative from enough films we've all seen before. The dialogue is simplistic, the acting cast little better but it's a CGI-fest.Don't go into this film thinking you are going to find any new great gem. It's part-Godzilla, part-Avatar, part-Independence Day and so on. It looks good, but there's hardly any good story. I was mostly bored.Some are going to like this a lot, as evidenced by the surprisingly positive reviews from the professional critics. Many others will just find it to be a passable action sci-fi thrill. I've seen much better elsewhere, and think you will have too. Up to you.","

"jesse-hitzroth","11 July 2013","One of summer's most anticipated movies is finally here, Del toro's Pacific Rim. This is a movie little boys imagine when they are young, playing in their sandbox. It's quite easy to see why Del Toro was attracted to such a film. It clearly shows in this film and I don't think many directors could handle a film such as this with such love and dedication to their craft. Del Toro really knows what audiences want. So is Pacific Rim his best film? No defiantly not, not even close. Is it at least a great film? No it's not. Pacific Rim however is entertainment at it's finest. It's difficult for me to rate a film like this . Pacific Rim has flaws. The human characters are pretty much awful, and the movie is cheesy as hell. I must also say 3 characters in this movie were probably some of the worst characters I have ever seen in a film. The main female, and the two scientists were just awful. However the real star of this film is the giant robots and the evil monsters. Del Toro knows how to entertain an audience and by god does he do it here. The action is fantastic and does not get to crazy like some Transformers movies do. This is the type of movie where you need to have your brain off and just be entertained. If you hate movies like this, then don't even bother checking this out, but if you have watched similar films and enjoyed them, then you will be all over this. Pacific Rim manages to be original and familiar at the same time. However because of Del Toro's fantastic direction and storytelling it's easy to overlook Pacific Rim's failures. This one redeems the mediocre summer films. Rating: on a film reviewers scale i would say 7.5 out of 10. However it's Del Toro i'm biased and above all rounding up to a solid 8 out of 10. Final Rating: 8 out of 10","

"fredberglyle","31 October 2013","A visual treat, I must say and a fairly good movie. Seriously I expected something bigger from the director who made me believe that fairy tales could be serious in Pan's Labyrinth. The movie certainly is bigger technically but falls behind novelty. Everybody has known transformers, battleship etc.., and not again with this combats. I've seen these animated combats way before in 1998 when I played metal fatigue game. Actors did a fair job sailing along the script and I disagree with the other reviewer who was telling that actors were bad. The first 10 minutes was excellent and I felt like 'm gonna see something like District 9 but the movie lost pace in the middle and got highly predictable (something like a lunch with a good soup and a bad main course). The bottom line is that the movie is visually appealing with nicely written dialogs to match but falls behind any new essence.","

"bravesfanc","27 July 2013","While I wasn't completely blown away by this movie like some other reviewers I did enjoy this quite a bit. It's more than an action movie, it has a decent story to keep you entertained while there aren't battles going on.One comparison I've heard is that this is just like Transformers. These people couldn't be more wrong. Transformers is for pure entertainment and the story comes second. I feel like this movie was better at making sure the story was relative to the action that was taking place. I also think that when there was action, it was shot better. And what I mean by that is the camera doesn't seem to shake and you don't only get quick bits and pieces of the fight.What I would compare it too, would be the T.V. show, ""Power Rangers"". All of those episodes would usually end with a battle between an enlarged creature against the Power Rangers who combined their droids, zords, I can't remember. Anyway, think of that but with the action 100 times better! If you enjoy action, some funny one liners, and a decent story that brings it all together, definitely give this a shot!","

"tedg","20 April 2015","Yes, I do find this man more disappointing than your average action director. It isn't that his movies are any dumber than others. They aren't. It is a reverse prejudice based on two qualities. He has a powerful visual ability, in beings, environments and machines. It irks me to no end that he cannot turn this to visual storytelling. The visuals are engaging. The stories are dull and have no intrinsic connection to what we see.The other expectation is the Hispanic filmmaker's dilemma: so very many use a tradition inaptly called magical realism. Poetry invades physics and we can either have a story where the nature of the story bends the nature of the world, or we have a parallel world interwoven within ours for a while. I am so taken with this style of filmmaking that I would now perish without it. Even Rodreguez has it in his kiddie and troubling exploitation movies. That del Toro seems so oblivious to this richness, while excelling in others that matter.... It is like a master chef's meal that is lovely but made from paper. So all this big slugging machinery? Paper.","

It's because IMDb won't let me give it a 0/10.When I saw the trailer I thought this movie could have potential but oooh my god was I wrong... This ""movie"" begs for extermination. And now that I think about it as I'm writing this, I think I hate it. I don't know how could a group of human beings make such a mess. The special effects is the only interesting thing to look at, but it's not worth it.This is why I enjoy movies from the 80s and the 90s. Most of those movies have good actors and very good story. I can care less about CGI.So my advice to you if you haven't seen the movie yet: don't waste your time/money, I beg you...","

On the other hand, there is nothing memorable about the plot apart from several CGI sequences. But even they were interesting only if you're into special effects. All members of the crew offer sub-par performance. At times it seemed as if some of them weren't even trying to act but rather spout the lines in front of the camera.","

"ugyenpeljor","11 July 2013","It is my sincere hope that this movie proves to be a huge hit, because that will mean we'll get more live-action anime adaptations from Hollywood! Why do I say this? Because Pacific Rim isn't a direct adaption of any one particle anime series, but rather, a homage to the entire genre as a whole. And all of this from the man who brought Hellboy to the big screen, no less! That said, the Human element in this was a little weak, the romance felt a little forced, and some characters felt too large for life. Case in point, in a movie that features 300ft robots and monsters duking it out and wrecking entire cities in their wake, the only element that felt really too excessive was Charlie Day's performance as the science fellow. The whole effect, ultimately, was the feeling of a comic book, but then again, this is exactly what the director intended, and exactly what we, the viewer, should expect. As you may have guessed by now, I'm a huge geek for anime, manga, kaiju films, and Japanese culture in general, so this movie was everything I could have wanted, and then some! That is why I encourage you all to check it out! In the mean time, I'll be biding my time until another Japanese monster star makes a well-earned and highly anticipated return to the big screen next year. Until then, this is ugyenpeljor signing out.","

"diddlydiddlydee","15 March 2014","This horrible excuse for a movie is the epitome of everything that is wrong with film-making these days. Style over substance. Visually stunning but devoid of everything else that makes a good film.Idris Elba was horribly miscast as was practically everyone else and I can't honestly say I have ever watched a film that was so empty and vacuous, so bereft of anything approaching a good performance. It's almost a credit to say that every facet of the movie was so utterly atrocious.By far the worst thing Guillermo Del Toro has made or ever will make and I'm sure he'll look back on it and think 'what the hell was I doing?'It pains me to say that Transformers 2 was better which tells you absolutely everything you need to know. Avoid this clichÃ©d CGI tripe at all costs. Having a colostomy bag fitted would be more fun.I would give it a negative mark out of 10 if I could. If this is where film-making is going, we're all going to hell in a handbasket.","

"siderite","14 October 2013","This film is a successful blend of Japanese mecha and American hero movies, although I personally am not a fan of either. Therefore the fact that I liked it has to mean something. First thing you have to do in order to enjoy the film, though, is leave out logic, critical thinking or any knowledge of physics and/or biology. This is not a movie about real life, so deal with it. Once you do that (bring nothing to the drift, so to speak) you will probably enjoy the film because it is really well done and lots of fun.The plot is simple: on the bottom of the Pacific ocean there is a dimensional rift through which giant Godzilla like monsters are coming through. The human solution is to build giant humanoid robots and punch the monsters to death. Yeah, I know. In a way, it is a sort of Top Gun with interdimensional alien monsters rather than Russians. Also the main character is impossible not to like: he is heroic, but also thoughtful and calculated, so completely different from Maverick.As usual, Idris Elba is a supporting character who by his selfless actions saves the world, then dies and the beautiful Caucasian lead gets all the credit. A tip of the hat to the Japanese origins of the mecha mythos, the female lead is Japanese, although she doesn't do much. Other known actors have small roles, to my chagrin. Ron Perlman plays as well (stay until the credits to see a final scene with him). The scientists are great, although perhaps their geekiness is a bit over the top and unnecessarily so.The special effects are almost flawless and, combined with heroic music and bar fight action scenes enlarged times a million, makes it almost impossible not to have fun. Heed my advice and do not think of solutions to the problems presented in the film, or you'll feel like the guy in the Shark Pool trailer. Just go with the flow. I find it ironic that in order to enjoy the film most you must follow the instructions given to the Jaeger pilots. I do hope that was intentional, if a bit cynical.Bottom line: I was sure I was not going to enjoy it and I was very wrong. My head still buzzes with alternative scenarios in the same conceptual world, but the path that Guillermo del Toro took was both crowd pleasing and respectful to the feel of Japanese mecha, thus I have no quarrel with it at all. So go watch the film.","

"DKosty123","21 July 2013","This movie has the honor of being my first IMAX 3D exposure to any movie. I have to admit that the effects, the 3D, and the surround sound is impressive. As for the movie, the plot has pretty much been done in 100's of films already. Aliens spoiling for taking over Earth (obviously they have not read any of our news about how we have wrecked the planet with climate change) have opened a portal into our planet to develop and plant monster after monster on our planet with plans to attack and destroy us. They want Earth and they want it bad. Sci-Fi fanatics plot to be sure.The best feature of this movie is that it is short, because it seems to turn into one attack after another after the first 15 minutes of the film. In fact, the scenes with people fleeing the attacks in Hong Kong reminded me very much of a 1950's Godzilla movie. Even the alien monsters look a lot like good old Godzilla, and in the case of the pregnant one, the bride of Godzilla.The humor is the only relief in this exercise, but there is not enough there to make it entertaining. The script is short and I feel sorry for the cast trying to bring over this turkey. Still, there are some great CGI effects so I guess everything is not lost.As for me, the most interesting moment is in the previews. It appears Warner Brothers is updating a great movie into the 3D Imax Surround Format that ought to really be something to see. They showed a new trailer for the 75 year old film which pretty much concentrated on special effects of the film, which after watching this one is 75 years ahead of it's time. Whoever at Warner had the idea of doing the old movie ought to be congratulated because I'd like to see it in IMax not just for special effects but to hear one of the great movie musical sound tracks in surround sound. That preview was for the 1939 Classic Wizard of Oz. As for Pacific Rim, it appears the San Andreas Fault is not in Kansas yet, Dorothy. If this movie was 3 hours long (ugh) there would be no place like home.","

"jodprak","11 July 2013","I just watched Pacific Rim on the first day/time slot of premiere in 3D. Yes, I am a geek. But that is not the whole point. If you had the excitement of watching anime movies of robots vs monsters in childhood, this is perfect movie for you. The Kaiju monsters design reminds me of Godzilla's villain monsters combined with Cloverfield monster, xenomorph (Aliens), and TRON. As for the Jeager robots, I'll let you to decide whether they are good or very good. :)To watch this movie I needed to change my mindset to be like a 10 ten year old robot geek child, like 29 years ago. Because if not, you will feel a lot of question marks and disappointment through this movie. The story is quite predictable. The plot and pace are simple enough for children to understand. And the nerd and geek professor appearances are a bit annoying for me. But hey, that what is all about: to celebrate the childhood memory of robots vs monsters.Overall, the movie is great for robot vs monsters anime fans. It's not even close to that horrible Michael Bay's Transformers.","

"quincytheodore","20 July 2013","There lies our inner child who will squeal when giant mecha heroically arrives to fend off gargantuan tower size monster in an epic battle that will surely destroy anything around them, but we really don't care about collateral damage. Pacific Rim is a homage to that forgotten child and ultimately the mecha genre. I didn't expect Japanese inspired Godzilla-esque scenes, where it was made from cardboard miniature and people in suit back in the old days, will be realized into hyper stylish modern day action movie. Granted, it's still marred by a few typical disaster movie clichÃ©s, but it will make your eyes open wide and mouth agape just seeing the colorful metal knight versus relentless organic behemoth as your childhood is relived once again.There hasn't been anything quiet like it visually. Color palette is glossy and bright, the motion of the gigantic being, either it's steel or flesh, is appropriately smooth. The scale of the encounters is immense, often showcasing stormy sea and dystopian night life to emphasis the clash. Use of 3D effect highlights it even more, its camera angle shows the threat of Kaiju, the monsters, in a daunting perspective. These walking antagonists deliver thrill light years ahead compared to usual monster type on their television counterparts. It makes the appearance of Jaegar, the robots, even more exciting and the battle that much better. There's just no shortage of colossal mayhem in Pacific Rim.Story takes a bleak contemporary setting where Kaiju attack gradually increases, however this is unlike gritty nuance of apocalypse, it still has some fun and humor. Humanity's answer for the Kaiju infestation is Jaegars. tall stoic robotic entities which take two persons to pilot by synchronizing their thoughts. With incredibly fast paced screenplay, the movie pulls audience to invest in the story. Charlie Hunnam from Sons of Anarchy fame takes the role of the troubled protagonist Raleigh Becket. He's clean cut with emotional baggage of losing his brother. In a way it makes him a compatible with Mako Mori, played by Rinko Kikuchi, the teen girl from Babel.The dynamic between them is the majority of the story, which arguable takes a bit longer than expected. They do relatively fine, although there's not much chemistry to be had. Charlie Day and Ron Perlman are present, mostly for comedy relief. It appears that the movie would like to introduce larger-than-life characters, much like those in anime. Some scenes don't really work since it's trapped in predictable cycle, such as some ridiculous death scenes or the speech before final battle.Credit must go to Guillermo Del Toro for creating a movie he's truly passionate about. Mecha genre is far from mainstream, especially in blockbuster, but it now has a decent representation in the form of Pacific Rim. Some silliness or occasional slow scenes aside, it's a fresh entertaining rendition of boys mecha fantasy and an especially irresistibly captivating action movie as a whole.Rate 8/10","

"p-stepien","11 October 2013","""Pacific Rim"" is hardly innovative. Actually quite the opposite it is an epic exercise in post-modernist Tarantinesque mash-ups, where Mexican director Guillermo del Toro takes Japanese kaiju inspirations and their love for big mechabots, molds it with some quasi-Lovecraft mythology to create a bombastic blockbuster feature with little other intent that to entertain. And del Toro clearly has absolutely no other higher pretence. Popcorn at its finest (at the same time setting a high bar for Gareth Edwards ""Godzilla"").When a mysterious rupture appears somewhere on the Pacific rim, giant monsters start emerging from the ocean, creating havoc and destruction on coastline areas. Confronted with this deadly gargantuan opponent a new method of defence must be formed, thus initiating the Jaeger programme of giant human-controlled robots. Due to the mental burden of controlling a monstrous Jaeger two pilots are necessary, both having to share their minds through a neural bridge. After a temporary turning of the tide in favour of humanity, the kaiju threat increases and soon all but four towering Jaegers are left to defend our planet. Amongst the remaining pilot is previously retired ace Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and an untrained cadet Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). Led by the legendary pilot Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) they are all that stands between the inevitable apocalypse.Focusing on the spectacle, del Toro does his best to distract attention from human casualties, so instead of single humans being treaded upon we see a visual treat of epic proportions. Forced on by cardboard cutouts the story can never be held as anything other than generic fodder, even if the masterful presence of Idris Elba spurting out gibberish, as if he was delivering Shakespearesque brilliance, does its best to hide the thinly plotted story. That said del Toro has enough sensibility and rationality to deliver a story without gaping plot holes and illogical contrivances, thus making it a thankful respite from cascades of movies spurting out nonsense with almost religious zeal.Within this behemoth of a movie lurk the age-old trusted interior mechanisms of blockbuster action movies, introduced however with a certain finesse of which directors like Michael Bay are incapable of. Pure enjoyment is what is on offer - expect anything else and you will be sorely disappointed. Lay back mind-meld to the blockbuster of the season.","

From the incredible CGI effects to even the awesome soundtrack this movie does no wrong. The only negative thing about the movie is the length, but with the amount of information and depth they put into the movie, one is amazed by how short the movie is compared to what it could be. Not once did I look at my watch and think ""When will this be over?"", like I do with most movies over 2 hours long. The fight scenes are very well done in this movie. You expect a fight scene between a 250 foot robot and a 300 foot monster to be cheesy and in your face but they aren't. All of the technology is explained very well and the camera angles are ones that allow you to see everything going on. I highly recommend that everyone on this site go see this movie now. Between the incredible visuals and the intense soundtrack you will almost be wishing this plot was real so you can hop in a Jaeger and kick some Kaiju ass.","

I had a blast and that is something that has been sorely lacking from the movies in this day and age. Man, I wish Roger Ebert could have seen this movie and taken comfort in the fact that the fun in film is still around.To get gripes out of the way first, it was a bit too long and there were some awful lines. Charlie Hunnam isn't a very good actor but hell, we didn't come to watch this movie for the character drama. We came for the battles. Holy crap, it's as if del Toro was told ""Just let loose."" His creature designs are utterly fantastic and I loved looking at the movie. The battles are hard-hitting and you really get the sense that these are massive, massive beings that are just larger than life. As far as I am concerned, the Transformers movies aren't even worth watching anymore. The Autobots and Decepticons have got nothing on the Jaegers and the Kaijus. Hopefully, in the future, we get to see a sequel! If you are looking for a good time, ignore the fools who went in expecting for a killer story and a killer script. It just ain't there. What is there, however, is a wonderful sense of fun and excitement, and that alone is worth the price of admission.","

It is also foreseeable as using the similar technique as Transformer but as awesome fighting scenes as its, the only consequence is paying back in box. The plot is quite simple fighting the monsters which is quite like a Japanese series used to be seen in childhood, in other words, maybe only children like it and only people want to relax without thinking too munch of movies would like pick this one. Obviously it has some plots aiming to touch the audience but it seems the effects are not very impressive.In terms of the good aspects, at least it gives a happy ending. The giant robots maybe satisfy the geeks. Also I like the perform Rinko did in this film it is definitely a Japanese performing which is very cute. She can be very serious very tough but behind that she is fragile needing a shoulder to rely on. That is also the reason why Japanese girls are good wives they are melt LOL.In conclusion it is fit for children but not for the ones too small maybe 10 years old and above. Apparently it is for box but failed. Well nothing to say but good luck to the next one.","

"nonprofitgnome1","25 July 2013","Pacific Rim was easily one of my most anticipated movies of the year. With a great director like Guillermo Del Toro, a fun cast with Idris Elba and Charlie Day, and monsters vs kaiju; hyped was an understatement. The movie almost lived up to its hype but unfortunately had its flaws.The movie is all about the human's war with the Kaiju (monsters from the ocean). To combat these monsters, society creates monsters of their own. The movie doesn't try and be anything more than that, a vehicle for monster vs monster combat.As expected, Del Toro delivers when it comes to one of the most stunning fight scenes I have ever seen. You could have put the middle fight scene from Pacific Rim into the middle of Batman and Robin and I'm still giving it a good score. I also enjoyed the performances by Idris Elba and Ron Perlman.Unfortunately, there were a few negatives. Firstly, the acting was just OK. Aside from Elba and Perlman, there weren't really any great performances. The scientists definitely overacted and the rest were just pedestrian. This wasn't a huge issue as I didn't come for the human interaction, I came for mecha carnage.The most disappointing thing with the movie was the ending. It's not that the final fight scene wasn't great in itself; it's just that it couldn't live up to the fight scene in the middle of the movie in the streets of Tokyo. The ending was a bit anti-climactic.If you are a fan of great action you can't go wrong with this movie. If you're a fan of mecha anime you can't go wrong with this movie. If you're a fan of Del Toro's you can't go wrong with this movie. Do yourself a favor and see it on the big screen, you won't regret it.","

"MetalBlade666","27 July 2013","For almost two years since I first heard whisper of Pacific Rim, I've been excited on a level I don't recall being excited about since I first heard about Independence Day. As the gradual feed of new footage, posters and trailers began to be unravelled at the beginning of this year, I was buzzing like a fly trapped inside a jar until finally the IMAX experience was upon me last night.I could sum my thoughts up in just three words - holy, f**king and s**t - but I need to put it in more articulate words that that.Sometimes though, what you want to express is difficult when existing words don't quite measure up. So invented a new word which is actually a portmanteau of several words.GARGANTEPITASTIC!Yes. The scale of the monsters and fighting machines is GARGANTUAN! The concept and theme of the film is truly EPIC! And the whole thing is put together with such skill by Guillermo del Toro that the end product is nothing short of FANTASTIC!Really, I think this may be the most enjoyable film I've seen at the cinema since Independence Day, maybe even ever? It's brilliant, and totally matched my expectations, and in the case of the actors, even exceeded them.When faced with the prospect of a film about giant robots versus giant monsters, it's difficult to look past giant robots and giant monsters, but spare a thought for the comparatively ant-sized humans of the piece. Unlike the classic TOHO movies where the people are generally just there to run away and point and look up, the people of Pacific Rim are integral to the story and play a major part. Charlie Hunnam is ruggedly heroic as the Jaeger (giant robot) pilot coaxed back from retirement by Idris Elba, almost presidential in his role of authoritarian, who himself channels Independence Day's Bill Pullman speech to rapturous approval.The first ten minutes is enough to sink it's hooks in, and by the time the Jaeger's take on the Kaiju (giant monsters) full force, it's delirious eye candy light years ahead of most action scifi blockbusters, with possibly only the likes of James Cameron or Peter Jackson coming close to being capable of realising on- screen what del Toro does here.This is a thoughtful, loud, spectacular, engaging and incredibly impressive example of where a quintessential summer blockbuster ticks every single box. Then draws some more boxes and ticks them as well. As soon as the end credits rolled I immediately wanted to see it again, and I honestly can't remember the last time that happened.I can't recommend Pacific Rim enough, and if there was a way to add an extra star to this rating then I would.","

"salaj1986","2 January 2014","It has a good score here on IMDb, but again it proved to be highly overrated. I gave it a 5 because it would have been much better, and contains no serious logical mistakes. It looks like the creators wanted some easy money, so they mixed everything together: robots, some fightings, aliens, etc... But. The story is poorly written, and basically follows a well known, and unbelievingly boring, and predictable path. No surprises at all. It's like nowadays no one really cares to write a good and exciting story, they concentrate only on the CGI effects, and they think the rest is not important. They copy-paste it from other movies and that's it. Apparently it looks working, sadly...","

"iraz","1 October 2013","Guillermo del Toro is an incredibly talented director and has always (until now) made interesting, intelligent films. Why he would stoop to a CGI loaded character-less film like this is beyond me. Are we sure this wasn't made by Michael Bay? I was excited to see ""Pacific Rim"" and had hope at the beginning but after about 30 minutes or so, I was bored. With poorly developed characters, this is nothing but a movie cartoon. Now that is probably fine for many movie goers and if that's what you like, fine! I like substance, a well scripted movie that gets you completely involved. That is not this film. Another issue is why do these type of films have to be so long? They are always well over two hours which can seem much longer if you are uninvolved.I don't understand the mostly high scores and positive critical reviews. Does this mean we expect that much less from our blockbusters? CGI alone does not a picture make!","

"TheSquiss","23 July 2013","My first reaction after viewing the trailer for Pacific Rim was: What the hell is Guillermo del Toro, the master behind Pan's Labyrinth, doing? My hope upon emerging from the screening is that he is laughing at us while counting his huge pile of money. The alternative, that he is actually proud of this mess, is a little depressing.No, Pacific Rim doesn't plummet the depths of the torpedoed hulks of Battleship but it doesn't belong on the CV of such a director. Take Transformers, (yes, that Michael Bay, um, epic) cross it with Godzilla (the Roland Emmerich offering â please, god, let Gareth Edwards make it all better with his Godzilla next year), take it down a notch and you'll find Pacific Rim close by.Sometime in the future, Earth has been attacked, not from space as we all expected, but from the depths. A fissure has opened and great big nasty creatures, known as kaiju, are emerging at regular intervals, trashing cities, killing humans and generally being a bit of a nuisance. Rather than call in the best munitions experts to develop weaponry that will penetrate the kaiju and then explode, somebody somewhere decided it would be better to spend countless billions on building huge transformers, sorry, jaegers, that can engage in hand-to-hand (with some gadgetry) combat, trash cities, kill humans and generally be a nuisance. That's where the sense of Pacific Rim goes AWOL.When the jaegers fail, washed-up pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) returns to the military fold to help save the day under the guidance of Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) and watched by trainee Mako Mori (Rinko Kiluchi).Like Battleship, the acting warrants no comment other than to say it's adequate and suits the film. Make of that what you will.If you do pay your hard earned cash to watch Pacific Rim, try to block out the dialogue. There is little hope for a movie when the men tapping out the screenplay (Travis Beacham and Guillermo del Toro) lumber Elba with inspirational speeches that appear to be Braveheart castoffs. Did they really think they could get away with such gems as: ""One: don't you ever touch me again. Two: don't you ever touch me again."" and""Today we face the monsters that are at our door, today we are cancelling the apocalypse!"" Oh boy. Elba may have boosted his profile with Pacific Rim, but his credibility remains with The Wire and Luther. Fortunately, penciled on his CV are some potentially very impressive films with Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom and The Gunman standing out.Pacific Rim is visually so cluttered it's difficult to see what is going on much of the time, although perhaps that's a blessing or even a ploy to maximize enjoyment. The ridiculous volume, though not ear-bleedingly horrendous like Dredd, is just painful.******** PLOT SPOILER ALERT ******** The greatest achievement of Pacific Rim is its attempt to pack in as many movie clichÃ©s as possible into 131 minutes: Parent/sibling angst is taken care of; injured party who saves the day is present and correct; comedy duo to lighten the mood? Yup. Just not very funny; 'are they/aren't they dead' scenario? Check; selfless act to save the world blah blahÂ Oh, and why do they have centres for jaeger creation/launch all around the world instead of just one mother of all missile launch pads next to the fissure from which the monsters emerge? My head hurts.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","

"Robin_clarke41","22 July 2013","This film had caught my attention a while back but the premise and the nature of its characters led me to pre-conceived ideas of what this film was going to be.However its huge budget, big name director and flashy trailer all drew me in, and I'm so glad they did! This does not so much feel like a movie but an event at times. You are witness to a grudge match on the most epic of epic scales. The fighting is intense, the monsters are damn scary and you find yourself feeling empathy for the huge, lumbering, humanoid robots. This is one of those movies you absolutely need to see on a big screen. In my case I went to the Odeon Imax in Greenwich which was perfect. Don't read too much about it, don't watch too many trailers, just go see it. I for one am seeing it again!","

"brighterside11","14 July 2013","For someone who is into more mature movies, this is God awful.If I were into a movie that did not take itself seriously, I would give this a 10/10 simply because it's the type of blockbuster that you watch for eye candy, stupid jokes, and just pure goofiness. So don't get me wrong, this movie is 'fun.'If you were expecting an even remotely believable plot, characters with depth, serious tone, and Tom Hanks type acting ability that makes you feel the feels, then this is NOT the movie you want to see.Many of the acting scenes in this movie just made me cringe. But again, those who don't care about the acting, or credulity and depth of characters will thoroughly enjoy the movie. Those looking for a serious flick that takes itself seriously, do a U-Turn on this one.","

"Michael Kenmore","13 July 2013","This review should be prefaced by the fact that I never saw the preview before coming to see the movie, so I was not needlessly spoiled to know the details and visuals of the movie, except a few publicity photos that piqued my interest.Much have been said about the movie by some noteworthy reviewers who reacted negatively. Suffice to say I found the movie to be an overambitious yet tepid attempt, which led to my struggle to sit through the movie, partly bored and mostly offended, for the reasons to be outlined by me.First, the visual effects and colorfully vibrant cinematography, in conjunction with 3-D, are spectacular, but occasionally bombastic and redundant. What matters is the story and proper characterization with plausible and non-cringeworthy dialogue, which is difficult to pull off in a big concept movie like Pacific Rim.I found the characterization of German-descent roles offensive in perpetuating the stereotype, such as the ""dorky"" mathematician, on top of ethnic stereotyping. In my mind, the most offensive stereotype in the movie is the irritatingly patronizing military leader played by Idris Elba, who might be familiar as having starred as the Norse God Heimdallr in the revisionist adaptation of ""Thor"".Despite the backstory established in the first ten minutes, the movie never felt right, only frequently dull due to the feeling of ""deja vu"" (having seen some big monster and mecha movies) and redundant monster versus mecha fight scenes.I came to see the movie, expecting a fun ride. But this movie is certainly not fun, at least pertaining to the questionable story arcs, occasional cringeworthy corny dialogue, stilted acting, excessively bombastic visual effects and production design (""eye candy""), disturbing scenes of violence that pushes PG-13 rating boundary, and, of course, stereotype and clichÃ© galore.I noted the general audience's mood was not quite receptive to Pacific Rim after the conclusion. Muted and perplexed reaction. I knew what I'm getting into, being familiar with mecha (the glacial but riveting Patlabor anime movies), but this movie just feels flat-out mediocre, which lends to disappointed feeling in deflated expectation.Pacific Rim is certainly an overambitious movie, with the co-writer and director Guillermo del Toro being aggravatingly self-indulgent as usual like in his preceding movies (I remember Pan's Labyrinth being obnoxiously didactic with gory violence when it came out in theatres to the audience's disgusted reaction).The movie is in essence childish in its reverence for self-serving moralistic approach, smirk-evoking cheese (in particular stilted acting & overacting with some eye-rolling dialogue), visual spectacle and PG-13-stretching violence.Guillermo del Toro is almost a good movie director, but he self-sabotages by focusing on the repetition and clichÃ©s, which not even film editing could save by excising some lame and extraneous scenes. (It is said the movie has an hour of extra footage.) Del Toro is one of the ultimate ""geek"" movie directors, the other his best friend James Cameron, but somehow Del Toro falls back on the standard clichÃ©s and stereotypes with the ""more is more"" bloated spectacle, which leads to the frustration of watching the movie as it repeatedly sabotages itself that lends to dull and exasperated feeling, which may explain the audience's near-universal negative impression.Pacific Rim has some merits, such as the astoundingly high production values, but the factors described above basically killed the movie in terms of mere enjoyment. The movie seems to mock the audience by patronizing attitude with stereotypical characterization, redundant monster versus mecha fight sequences that feel padded out and ineptly manipulative emotional scenes that feel dishonest.This is Guillermo del Toro's ""toy movie,"" not unlike Michael Bay who fundamentally destroyed The Transformers with the regressively worse sequels to seek the box office fortune.Pacific Rim would have been a fun movie, but, unfortunately, it is not. Perhaps Del Toro needs the lesson how James Cameron succeeds in producing the consistently and thoroughly entertaining movies, which do not directly or indirectly insult the audience, that result in box office records.The movie is consigned to mediocrity by the reason of self-sabotage that belie Guillermo del Toro's impressively ambitious & creative energy yet might be tempered by the patronizingly smug attitude. Pacific Rim just feels dull and forgettable by the time the show is over, which makes it a truly ""half-assed"" movie.** out of 4","

"inigojordana","21 July 2013","I didn't really expect much, coming into the IMAX theatre, as I had been advised. I feared of a plot that may have been lacking, a director with a few mishaps like Hellboy, and a budget that was focused all on CG. The CG was basically all I was banking on to make this film one of a kind... Then, minutes into the film, it hit me -- IT IS AWESOME!!!! The plot is well-rounded, with a good focus on characters and the situations surrounding them; the action - intense, and the film was put together beautifully. What got me most excited was that this could start a revolution of man-operated robot films!! If they could do this, they can do Voltron, Mazinger-Z, Voltes V, Gundam, and nothing would be able to stop them! Just think of the possibilities... They're endless!","

"evanston_dad","19 August 2013","""Pacific Rim"" is a simply terrible piece of summer movie junk food from a director I expected much more from.In a plot that really isn't that much like ""Avatar"" yet managed to feel like a rip-off of it, humans have waged war on a bunch of big monsters from the deep by building giant robots and controlling them with their minds. For the robots to work, they need to be piloted by two people, and it's important that those two people are as psychically linked as possible in order to be effective. Guillermo Del Toro, who made one of my favorite action movies ever (""Hellboy II""), could, I thought, be trusted to bring just the right blend of style, comedy and characterization to make this film rise above the summer fray. But this movie is lacking in all three, instead substituting thunderous sound and visual effects, apparently in an attempt to numb its audience into submission so that we no longer care whether or not what we're watching makes any sense.I felt the same way watching this movie as I did watching last year's ""Prometheus."" It's like Del Toro conceived this elaborate story in his head and then made only the second half of it into a movie. The feeling is not unlike coming into the second of a two-part miniseries, where you know what you're watching would make a lot more sense if you had seen it from the beginning.Grade: D","

"MisterHOH","16 July 2013","Going in with this expectation, you will not be disappointed, but if you think you will have an awe inspiring experience you might have a bad time. I just seen it in IMAX and I have to say that half of the time I couldn't tell what's going on during the fight sequences. I'm not the only one here complaining about this. It is clearly an editing defect and also a color grading defect since everything is too dark during the fights. I do not understand this new trend by splitting the movie in very long and stale sequences and then cut to endless fighting scenes which strain the eye and over-saturates the senses. Just intertwine them up into a more coherent story driven film. It is not rocket science. It's editing 101.The acting was exactly what you would expect from a robots vs monsters film. Nothing more nothing less; cardboard cutouts, stereotypical, without any arcs. There is only one female role (except few others extras) in the whole film which is totally out of balance with the social dynamic created within the narrative. The music is good and it works. It is funny that ""works"" today turned into a compliment though. It does a good job of embracing brutal fighting sequences and it also works on squeezing out that much needed gram of emotion. It feels really nice to hear thematic and fleshed out melodic material making a comeback in a world where soundtracks have become mostly sound design.CGI is well... CGI. The monsters sometimes look silly, not menacing enough and the giant robots seem very fragile and clunky. I know this is a form of a tribute to the golden age of cinematography where giant monsters were some guys dressed up in rubber suits walking around a set made out of cardboard, but a tribute should be a short and clear statement, not an entire two hours film. In my opinion, CGI should complement and augment good acting, good story telling, good character development, not to be the sole reason for the existence of a film. Yes, this is a robots vs monsters movie, but that doesn't justify disregarding the very foundation that makes up a cinematic experience. Popcorn and all, i saw at least three opportunities for the story to take an alternate route to a more complex and fulfilling end scenario.Like any other of my fellow sci-fi enthusiast, I can suspend my disbelief. I can even stretch it pretty far. But I cannot in good faith support the stupidity needed for a story to exist. Darwin winning prize minds thought it was better to build giant robots that work via an incredibly complicated and unexplainable mind meld of two people instead of arming strategic nuclear devices on the bottom of the Pacific and detonating them whenever one of the monsters emerge. I have games where I can operate giant robots using my keyboard and mouse only. There are surgeons who in extremely difficult operations are using robots that are capable of performing incredible and accurate tasks. There are guns today that can inflict unimaginable chaos and destruction on almost any kind of earthly scale. Yet in this film, we need giant clunky robots that perform ninja-like actions to wrestle and beat the monsters to a pulp, piloted by some people that are somehow compatible to mind meld in a black magic driven process. And let's put them right in the middle of the action, because you know, remote control is too futuristic. We see steel penetrating the monster's skin while F22 rockets are barely effective against it, because again, there's nothing better than a knife at a gunfight. This is Occam's razor violation at its finest. You want to justify giant robots fighting giant beasts? Then please make it so in a way not to sound so abysmal when the whole script is laid out on the table. Comic relief is a poor attempt to say the least. The only two ""bright minds"" available in the whole world act like Laurel and Hardy all throughout the film, reaching idiotic and blatantly obvious conclusions. They are nothing more than embarrassments for the scientific community and they are the perfect portrayal for how this movie treats its science. The film has its few moments to shine, but that's about it. They do not add up to something more. The story is too simple and it's told in an amateur way. Acting is bad not because actors fail to deliver a good performance, but because there is no performance for them to give. Directing is not good; fighting scenes are too pampered becoming over-saturated, and in other scenes it is almost absent. Music is the only redeemable quality of this title that I quite enjoyed. This is a high-budget triple A popcorn flick, but for me personally this film was a let-down. After all that hype and attention it received in media, I hoped at least that at the end of it I will get that smile, that u-mph that says ""Ok, this was a decent summer flick"", but alas, it did not happen. Even if you have low expectations like I had, you still might not enjoy this title, therefore I would recommend you not to go and see it, because you would only feed the hungry money making Hollywood machine and right now they need to realize that spewing out half baked films like this will not help them for the future. But that again what do I know? I'm just another random ticket-payer movie-goer, who wrote another review in a sea of endless reviews that are disregarded completely by the film industry.","

"Hitchcoc","19 January 2024","I have to admit I always enjoyed the Fifties big lizard movies. I also got a kick out a pretty weak movie like Independence Day. This is the child of those things. There is nothing new here other than the amazing big screen confrontations. We have a threat to the earth by a species that has risen to the surface and doesn't seem interested in any kind of negotiations. They want to stomp, devour, destroy and all that, but they are quite marvelous. At first they become kind of Apollo Creeds to the Earth's Rockies. I wouldn't be surprised if they had bets on them in Vegas. Anyway, the bad boys start to evolve and send bigger and nastier folk, until we ""good guys"" are watching our world be taken from us. The main weapons are gigantic robotic things sort of like Transformers, and they are manipulated by fighters inside them. The human element is missing here. The people are boring and one dimensional. But it's a big action movie. During the battle scenes it was hard for me to make out who was doing what. Still, it's a nice way to spend a couple hours without having to use your brain.","

"lilguyollie","1 August 2013","We all saw the trailers early on and perceived this to be an adults version of power rangers. Whether that sounded good or not to you, it's still worth watching. Don't be put off by the lack of big name actors in this movie as this proves that the reputation of an actor does not men they will make the film good, also proved by The Lone Ranger.Pacific Rim's premise is that giant dinosaur like creatures called Kaijus are attacking the countries which surround the Pacific Rim, which contains a portal which leads to the Kaijus dimension. To combat this, the UN pooled their resources together to create giant robots known as Jaegers to fight them. The Kaijus begin to evolve and with the UN losing faith in the Jaegers, they make one last stitch attempt to permanently deal with the Kaijus.Starting as always with the positive points, everyone in the film provides an A plus performance. Maybe it's because we expect the acting to be mediocre due to the emphasis on CGI and the lack of big name actors. Maybe this would make us look at this and think it's much better than I thought it would be. But no it's just plain good. The CGI is marvellous, as are the fight scenes and both combined is just as colossally gorgeous as the monsters. Whilst the story isn't as engaging or stimulating we would expect, especially from Mr del Toro, the ending is still satisfying and leaves room for a possible sequel. As an added point i'd like to ask how the hell did Grown Ups 2 beat this movie at the box office? because basically that film is bloody awful.Overall, it's like this concept was purposely drawn up for Michael Bay just so that he can have a CGI vacation with this. However, the story is still engrossing ad the action and acting keeps the viewer in the moment and excited. If you're action fans, you will love it and if you are fans of a deep, twist filled storyline you will learn to appreciate it. Basically, if you are reading this, Go see this movie. Like now.","

"apophysisman","6 October 2013","If you are not in a coma or if you are over the age of 8 don't go see this movie. It is terrible. On the other hand, if you are under the age of 8 I think you will like it! In short, this is a movie for kids, not for adults.So what is wrong with it? Everything.1. Acting is terrible.Mostly poor acting. The relationships in the movie are hard to relate to. The characters are impossible to relate to. Actually, the acting of the two scientists is so bad it makes the others seem not so bad after all. 2. Most details of the plot are terrible.Giant monsters come through the ocean floor from another dimension and kill millions of people. That seems like something that could be a fun science fiction action movie. But, how did they get there? How do they survive the pressure and heat? How do their skeletons handle the enormous weight of their bodies when they come out of the water? Well, apparently they did and they do all of that. Let's just accept it.How do the smartest men on earth decide to defend against these monsters? By building giant robots called Jaegers that punch them. However, the monsters have skin and horns that are tougher than steel so nothing much happens when they are punched. So when you build your robot you make sure it's steel has the appropriate strength, right? Wrong. Let's make them really fragile so the hull can easily be breached. Yes!!It turns out (somewhere in the later parts of the movie) that the monsters can be cut in half with knives and killed with fire. Wouldn't it then be a good idea to kill something like this with something that actually works, like an appropriately sized bomb instead? No, let's punch them with these fragile robots. Yes!!During the debriefing after a fight, let's use the knowledge we have gained during the fight to prepare for the next fight. Wrong! Let's not learn anything. Yes!!When the monsters are attacked by airplanes and helicopters they fly so close that the monsters can punch them. Who, with just the tiniest amount of survival instinct, would fly a plane like that?Most of the fighting takes place in the ocean. Since the hulls of the robots are so easily breached let's protect the pilots with at least some sort of oxygen mask! Wrong! Let's not do that!! Let them instead drown. Yes!!Some fighting takes place under water where vision is extremely poor. So let's equip the robots with state of the art systems to detect monsters, so pilots aren't surprised by monsters sneaking up on them. Wrong! Let them use their own eyes. The result is they don't see much and are constantly surprised by attacks they were unaware of. Yes!!Since fighting can be tiring for the pilots, shouldn't we try to make the way they control the robots as effortless as possible? Wrong! Let's put them in heavy suits of metal and attach them to giant mechanical constructions. Yes!!Why are the pilots inside the robots to begin with? Because wireless data transmission doesn't work in the future, right? Well it turns out it does work. But let's try and make a system where if the robot is destroyed the pilots are killed. Yes!!Robots are controlled partially with the mind by something called ""drifting"". One person using all of his brain for drifting would put too much strain on him. This is just the way the robot ""drifting"" system works. Let's not rebuild that system. Let's instead rebuild the entire robot so that we need two pilots in each. Yes!!To pilot a robot it seems you need to use ""drifting"". However, nowhere in the movie do you see any pilot controlling anything through the mind. But let's keep it because it is cool. Yes!!Since we are equipping the robots with a few weapons shouldn't we try to make the launch mechanism fast? Wrong! Let's make sure there is enough time for the monsters to rip the weapons from the robot before it fires. Yes!!Let's lift these 2000 tonne robots with 8 helicopters. Because 5 tonnes of lifting force x 8 helicopters = 2000 tonnes of lifting force and that will work, right? Yes!!When fighting in a city let's walk over a few hundred cars and through a few buildings because that is a really funny thing to do and hopefully there are no people there anyway. Yes!!Sometimes when they need to talk or reflect on life or whatever the monsters will wait for them to finish before they attack again. On the other hand, how else could the actors finish what they have to say? Yes!!In the very beginning of the movie, the leaders of the world have realized how ineffective the robots are. So they instead decide to build walls to protect cities from the monsters. Because monsters can't climb, right? And people only live in cities, right? The construction is based on extensive analysis of the monsters bone and muscle structure to make sure the walls are strong enough, right? Wrong!CGI effects in this movie are realistic and cool. The visual effects are extremely well done. However, since the plot and the story and some of the acting is so poor it really makes you wonder. If there are all these talented people doing CGI effects, why were there no other talented people involved in making this movie?To summarize. Mankind is portrayed as extremely stupid. Good CGI effects. Poor directing. Poor acting. Poor story-line. Avoid.","

Once again, del Toro doesn't disappoint in visual effects at all, I think his sound department also has done a great job. The action scenes, they look awesome, you get engaged in them quickly and get excited for them, it's actually how the movie starts and then the title comes after 17 minutes (which I really liked that, because it set up the tone of the movie before anything officially gets started). However, series of denial decisions happen by different characters that none of them makes sense at all; in fact it creates some frustration. Besides that, the two scientists are just too cartoonish, which I guess they're meant to be there to create some humor, but in my opinion it makes the movie cheesy. About being cheesy, the ending should have been better (maybe I should blame it on the studio?), however what I like about the story is, it's not a commercial movie for national guard, army, navy, air force or anything like that, it's not USA saving the world, and I really dig that. The performances are decent, Idris Elba absolutely owned this movie, he definitely doesn't seem to be a supporting role, Charlie Hunnam whom I had seen for the first in Green Street Hooligans is great as well, but Charlie Day to is a little annoying here, I can't really blame it on his performance, again his role is just too cartoonish. Also regarding the soundtrack, it's decent and good enough for the movie, however my expectations from Ramin Djawadi has been raised since Game of Throne's latest season soundtrack was just amazing.Overall, if you're going to this movie for the battle scenes, you'll enjoy the feck out of it, in that case the movie would get slow at some points, and if you expect some amazing story here, you'd be disappointed. Even that, the movie is still entertaining; I give it 7.5/10.","

"TaZmAnOO7","17 July 2013","Just saw this movie in 3D - was expecting so much given the hype and the fact that Guillermo Del Toro was directing, but it was a total let down. Everyone I watched this movie with thought the same.This movie was a complete borefest and consisted of nothing but CGI?? Seriously - there was nothing else. The acting was wooden and mediocre and every moment was full of cheese. The script was non existent. Where was the story?? The whole movie was as if the entire CGI department was just vomiting everything they possibly could on screen. It is CGI overload. Don't get me wrong - The CGI is good - no problems there, however, there is literally no film or story here to watch. You didn't care about any of the characters and everything was totally predictable from start to finish. Everything was repetitive. As if all the above wasn't bad enough, the soundtrack for the film was abysmal - the tune was repetitive, amateur and majorly annoying. It was like a kid messing with his keyboard playing the same few keys - seriously, whoever did the music in this film should be out of a job. This film is for a seriously dumb audience without any intelligence - I'm amazed at how much money and CGI was thrown at this movie given the total lack of story and script. This is without doubt Guillermo's worst movie in history. He has messed up big time with this movie. He seems to have forgot the absolute basics in movie making. Have a story to tell at the very least. There is no story, no script, no decent acting or anything. The movie is full of brainless stereotyping too - it's embarrassing and like a child made this movie. There is nothing to keep you interested. CGI does not make a movie good - when will Hollywood learn this?? You will not see a better example of this fact than watching this movie.","

"angelicseven","6 December 2013","I haven't really seen a good movie like this in a long time. It kept me on the edge of my seat to where I couldn't sit still. What kept me from giving it a perfect 10 is because of the swear words used in it. I have known from long time observation that any time swear words put in a movie ruins it from being watched over and over; as a result, it won't be a timeless masterpiece. Swear words used in a movie is usually to cover up poor story plot, character development and or weak dialogue. I hope the creators of this movie will remove such and use more creative ways of expressing. I have recognized like some of where Pacific Rim is like Independence Day. What this show seems to be saying, if any, is we can't use conventional means of warfare when we are up against something much bigger than any normal wars on earth and that threats to humanity doesn't have to always come from space when they could be deep within our own back yard for years. The only characters I liked best in the movie were played by Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Hunnam. Even though they were probably suppose to be the comedy side in the movie, I didn't care for the two weak nerdy intelligent characters who ended up doing a scientific mind meld with the alien creatures. I do hope another of Pacific Rim will be made!","

"Hey_Sweden","24 August 2017","Humans must do battle with massive monsters known as Kaiju when a ""breach"" between dimensions opens deep within the ocean. To do this, the people of the world unite to create equally colossal fighting machines dubbed Jaegers (the German word for ""hunter""). In order to successfully operate a Jaeger, a bond, or ""Drift"", must exist between two pilots, a bond that is mental and spiritual as well as physical. The fate of humanity rests on the shoulders of Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who will go into battle with an eager to please rookie (Rinko Kikuchi) at his side.Here, acclaimed filmmaker Guillermo del Toro attempts to play in the same sort of sandbox popularized by movies like ""Independence Day"". Overall, it's more of a visual effects showcase than it is anything else, with a thin story and an over emphasis on spectacle. It comes off like a video game adaptation much of the time, with not too many human moments along the way. Granted, the movie is pleasing to look at sometimes, with a virtual candy store of futuristic images. The Jaegers are also imaginatively designed (at least, their interiors are), although the Kaiju are not particularly impressive.As could be expected, this is not the thing you want to watch if you're looking for truly great acting. Too many of the characters and performances are annoying, although Idris Elba, as Beckets' sombre commanding officer, has a typically solid presence. Hunnam is an underwhelming hero, with no real charisma at his disposal. Ron Perlman, whose working relationship with del Toro dates back to 1992 and the film ""Cronos"", hams his way through a brief role as a sleazebag who deals in Kaiju body parts on the black market. The true saving grace is the cute and appealing Kikuchi.Del Toro does his able best to keep his audience from being bored, but without the desire to consistently root for the heroes, it's hard to care a great deal for many of the characters here.Still, if you just want a gung ho popcorn flick, and aren't looking for substance, ""Pacific Rim"" is passable entertainment.Seven out of 10.","

"Theodor-turner","25 July 2013","Pacific Rim is largely an action epic, and a good one at that. The narrative itself is based on Japanese monster (kaiju) films, and - while paying homage to the classic 'style' - manages to be very modern and fairly grounded in reality. Pacing is good and the story has a set of well-placed twists, accompanied by some interesting character development. The casting, on the other hand, is not great, but does not detract from the experience. In contrast, the direction is fantastic. Guillermo del Toro does a great job of making the large and scary feel huge and terrifying, without making a mess on-screen. Several great touches add to the 'epic' feel of the film, such as the detail on the hide of the kaiju and the fantastic sound effects. Coupled with a great musical score, this film would be one of the best this year. Sadly, there is a small problem that stops this film being fantastic, but great instead: the scientist sub-plot.Two scientists are in the process of finding a new way to stop the kaiju, and they manage to be fairly useless and rather annoying. They have a fair number of cheesy lines, which left me wishing that their sub-plot had been left out of the film. Nevertheless, Pacific Rim is still very good, and definitely worth watching. I give it an 8 out of 10.","

"ted-peterson","4 October 2013","SPOILER ALERTMay the drift be with youTo be kind, this could be categorized as an homage to Toho Studios. The Japanese have been fascinated with movie monsters ever since Godzilla. But, alas, this is formulaic, trite and just how much monster fighting can one person take? I love it when alien monsters have a complete repertoire of WWE moves and MMA moves. I guess Martial Arts are soooo universal that they transcend space-time. I love it when mechanical, human guided robots smash their metal fists together. Oh where is Robbie when we need him? The characters were right out of Dragonball Z (The TV series.) and many other children oriented Japination shows. This movie is visually stunning which shows the power of CGI. It is visually impacting but not compelling. Back in the 1930s, one EE ""doc"" Smith, a doughnut and pastry engineer for food companies began writing extended Sci-Fi. One of his extended series was called ""the Lensmen"" and it was about as juvenile as this: No sex or romance or any kind of relationship. Crazy, hyper mad scientist types, criminals who don't give a whit for humanity and are willing to plunder anything for a supposed clientele of eager people who can't wait to get the booty while their world disintegrates around them. and on and on. Smith never had ""Star Wars"" or ""Harry Potter"" and movie SCI-FI outside of Lang's ""Metropolis"" was pretty lame. We have models we can work off of but this movie only takes an animation form and adds better graphics. In a way, the cheezy Toho movies were actually more interesting. they were for kids and had kids as principals in the movie.Let's box and engage in fisticuffs instead of using technology as advanced as the robots appear to be to kill the monsters. Let's throw monsters around instead of zapping them with lasers. Let's wait until they appear instead of working on ways to close the rift. Let's call analog digital and vice versa. Let's suspend everything we could know and should know about human dynamics and just get it on with a bunch of monsters that aren't even that original. They are rendered better though. I give this movie a 1 for graphics. The director should be ashamed for stooping so low as to pander to whatever audience of seven-year olds he is aiming towards. This movie is so trite that it even has a dog barking approval at the end. All the money could have been put towards something with real imagination but maybe we as people just want to wallow in wrestling beat downs.","

"saytosandeep","18 July 2013","Pacific Rim. I was not very interested in it after watching trailer. I thought it just looks like another action packed CGI movie on big creatures like Transformers and I am happy I proved myself wrong by giving it a try. Yes it's like Transformers where everything is too big to fit in even IMAX screen but treatment is where it scores. It doesn't take too much time to make a plot for its big action sequences. The threat is there from the very first scene, where Kaijus (An Asian legend on the lines of Godzila) can vanish the whole human race. So humans created big robots Jaegars operated by two pilots at a time to fight them and the whole movie is about how it all ends. The whole movie is so much fun to watch that you feel like a kid enjoying WWF fight on big screen. The whole movie is another excellent example of CGI visuals and creatures and it gets even better with immersive 3D experience. Characters and twists are predictable but they are never overdone. Dialogues are funny at times. Performances are average. All in all, you won't like to blink throughout the movie because you don't want to miss the punches Jaegars make to Kaijus. I hope there will be a sequel to it because this effort needs to be rewarded.","

The comments made by people around me always start with ""horrible story"" and end up with ""perfect special effects though"". Truth to be told, I can totally foresee that, for nearly all action movies follow this trend. But I was wrong. There is no single twist surprising and the actress really can't act! What's wrong with her face?! She does not know how to smile, does she? Then the robots. Come on. These huge machines are unable to leave deep impression on audience. The fighting scenes are of great chaos-sea water, buildings, robots and monsters mix with each other so that I could only tell that something is moving in the screen. The finale eventually adds the last awful stroke. The only thing of this movie worth keeping is the theme song, boosting work efficiency.","

The characters were one dimensional and watching this movie I felt like I was watching 2 10 year old Asian kids play fight with their toy robots. Boring! I would of had more respect for the film if they didn't try so hard to create interesting characters...the fact that they did try and failed just aggravated me even more. Not to mention that the science behind every aspect of the movie was laughable. A hole in the middle of the pacific that water doesn't fall through, but 200 foot tall monsters come out of with increasing frequency. Huh? Mankind's best defense against these monsters is to build equally large robots to fight them? Why not go with a biological or chemical attack...it works so well when humans do it to each other! In addition the robots can only be controlled by 2 people whose brains must (inexplicably) be linked together? I felt like someone took a poop in my hat an made me wear it.","

Bad Acting, Bad Story, even the CGI effects which you would expect to be good seemed to consist of mainly badly modeled robots splashing about in a sea of Gray and blocks of concrete or cars flying about. I am guessing the effects were made to emphasize the 3D experience, unfortunately it only emphasized how bad it all was.As this is a mainly CGI driven film I have to compare the cgi with things like the transformer films which although not great films in their own right were nowhere near as bad as this turkey. I should point out I am an utter scifi/cgi fan but I watched the whole thing hoping that things would get better but they didn't, and sorry to say but this over hyped film really disappointed.","

"pongigmon","29 July 2013","Usually, these blockbusters are merely eye popper in trailers and never live up with the expectation. I have to say I didn't think this would be the exception before I went to watch the robots combating the monsters from deep down the ocean. I also had a few questions in mind beforehand and the reasons depicted in the film is sensible for audience to fantasize how the two pilots control the robot 'Jaeger' with their simultaneous movement of the body. It's critical for the two pilots to have mutual understanding under the neural bridge technology to enable them to activate the impeccable 'Jaeger'.The movie succeeded to compel me right from the beginning when the protagonist â Raleigh Becket, played by Charlie Hunnam lost his fellow pilot who is also his brother during the battle with the sea monster which they called Kaiju. This scene shows how tough it is for the human race to clash against an invincible extraterrestrial force and the danger posed to be in a 'Jaeger'. The scene has well set up as the prologue of the story and briefly insinuates that the war is yet to come.One of the great thing about this movie is that every characters in the story have their highs and lows and you could sense their joy and agony throughout the movie. All the characters have a different story behind them which makes what they are and how they stride against the global doom. Rinko Kikuchi who plays Mako Mori is a Japanese girl adopted by the Marshall at adolescent when Japan was under attack. The character is sophisticated with love and hate throughout the film, the affection she shows toward her fellow partner Raleigh and her appreciation, respect to her foster parent Marshall Stacker Pentecost played by Idris Elba. Her rage and hope for vengeance grows as she lost her parents during childhood which cause her to trapped in the past and become a major concern for Stacker. Idris Elba has provided a powerful performance in the movie and the character is gradually unveiled, from a strict superior to a compassionate father who is willing to make sacrifice and devote himself to the public. The relationship between these major characters is complex which gives a lot more depth to the story.Without a doubt, one thing to take a note of is the flawless visual effect which is literally sublime in my point of view. The scene which is sited in Hong Kong is simply ravishing, the two forces collide in the dazzling cityscape crammed with skyscrapers, it has further amplify the effect and the colossal impact these alien force would have cause. You would sense that the apocalypse is actually coming and the world is in despair that it will come to an end.It's every child's dream to watch the gigantic robot wrestling against monsters from outer space, if you are a big fan of anime by any chance, you're going to love this movie. It's blatant that the movie has taken some reference from the anime comic book with the style of monster and robots appear in the film. The influences of the robot combat scenes from Tranzor Z, Gundam or Neon Genesis Evangelion is crucial in shaping this film. Guillermo del Toro has done a magnificent job to give audience an intoxicating encounter between the mankind and the alien monstrous creature. It's an action packed, exuberant performance overall and a blockbuster that is worth watching indeed!","

"ollie1939-97-957994","17 July 2013","Pacific Rim is a movie that could possibly lower your IQ as well as anger people expecting the next Pan's Labryinth from Guillermo Del Toro. However it's an entertaining film that hasn't been the disappointment that some of the other blockbusters have been this year. Pacific Rim is essentially a mixture of Transformers, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots and Godzilla movies. The basic plot for the movie is that giant monsters called Kaiju have come from another dimension deep in the earth's core. As a result humans build giant robots called Jaegers to stop the Kaiju attack. As you can see the story is paper thin with very little character development or background to the film. It is also filled with clichÃ©d characters and more action than Transformers or the Avengers had. If you can get past this you will be transported to the mind of a 11 year old excited at the prospect of seeing giant robots and aliens fighting it out. The action and the CGI are the main reasons and the best parts about the movie. There isn't a lot of shaky cam in the fight sequences which is a good thing. The CGI is incredibly detailed with you actually seeing parts of the Jaegar's body flying off its body. The Kaiju also look very realistic. Despite the weak character development the actors do a good job with what they're giving. Charlie Hunnam(from Sons of Anarchy) and Rinko Kikuchi do a fine job as our main hero's. Charlie Day( from It's always Sunny in Philadelphia) and Burn Gorman do good jobs as the comedic relief for the movie. Ron Perlman and Idris Elba are the two stand out performances just because these two guys are the biggest bad asses in the whole of the movie( with the exception of the giant robots. Overall the movie is good despite its weak character development and paper thin story. It makes you feel like an 11 year old again and it will probably be the most entertaining action film of the whole summer.","

"Rendianami","14 July 2013","I created an account on here solely because of some of the negative reviews that the movie had received in regards to the producer using this movie as his ""personal fanboy playground"". I find it hard to believe that anyone could not enjoy this spectacular movie, and find it disheartening to see that it's beaten in the office box. I didn't know what to expect when I walked into the theater today. I hadn't really watched the trailers with any particular interest, and the only reason I came to see it was because I'd heard that GLaDOS would be voicing the computers in this. I'd been slumped in my seat, expected to be bored (because of the title), but I was blown away the moment the movie began. I definitely did not expect to see what would carry on throughout the movie, a spectacular sight to behold.There's such a variety of aliens in terms of design, and it really brought me to the edge of my seat, squealing like a fangirl at all of it. The robots were great as well, bringing with it the fiery love I have for the Transformers movies. The human characters themselves, I came to like as well, despite my resilience for liking any human character in a live action film. I felt for them during scenes, and adored the portrayal that many of the actors/actresses nailed on the spot. They came off to me as people that I could see in real life (namely the two scientists). I didn't see any lull in the movie whatsoever. I was constantly drawn to the screen with things that I love. I saw/thought of many references throughout the film, which made it more pleasing to watch as I could relate back to those things. It's like a giant conglomeration/fanfiction crossover. Aliens, Transformers, Real Steel (though I haven't actually watched it yet), Evangelion, Godzilla, Hellboy, Portal (this is the most prominent one, and the one that drew me to the movie in the first place), 2012, and much more. I don't see why anyone would give this movie less than an A unless they were asking to be the bad cop in this reviewing scene. And I'm not stopping at one viewing. I can't wait to see it multiple times, both in normal and 3D, over the next two weeks. It's not a movie that you can see just once. There are so many things to see, and this glorious movie deserves all the attention it can get. Best live action/CGI movie I've seen since Transformers (I'm talking about the CGI on this one, because I don't care as much for the script). I'd say this is my new favorite movie, and I don't play favorites easily.","

"Pozdnyshev","17 May 2015","I know enough about filmmaking to where I can look at a movie and have some idea of how much work had to go into making it. And right from the start, Pacific Rim is STAGGERINGLY well-produced, so much so that it blew my mind. Giant monsters tear up the Golden Gate Bridge in slow motion. Giant robots wrestle with them underwater. Funky Chinese neighborhoods rebuild around the rib bones of vanquished monsters. We see the sumptuously detailed, futuristic airplane hangars where the giant robots are built.And it starts off pretty good, too -- giant marauding monsters from a tear between dimensions at the bottom of the ocean? And the only way they can be fought is with giant robots? I actually bought that, the way they explained this at the beginning made it seem plausible -- sort of a surreal parable about man challenging the gods with his cunning. With the promise of there being even more dangerous monsters to come, I was excited about seeing the rest of it.Unfortunately, it slowly got more boring after the exposition. It wasn't the lame acting, which was good enough for a movie about giant robots. This isn't Officer and a Gentleman.No, the biggest problem was just that the monsters and the robots just looked BORING... And all VERY SIMILAR. I mean come on, you have all this money and all these top artists and animators at your disposal, yet the monsters are all these desperately middle-of-the-road ""Godzilla 1998"" knock-offs with absolutely no personality. The monsters from ""Inhumanoids"" were more creative and scary than these brain-dead lumps that just lumber through towns and throw slow-motion haymakers while roaring like walruses.","

I have seen another review that raves about the film being exciting from the start to the end. I can kind of see where the reviewer is coming from as the film is pretty much action all the way through. The downside to that though is that there is very little in terms of character development. The characters and plot play second fiddle to the action. You really don't care who lives and who dies because you have no insight or feeling towards any of the characters.

In the first minutes of the movie the whole story is so quickly summed up that it makes you wonder if it was something the editor felt he should throw in a couple of hours before the first screening. And then there's little left of a story to tell after that, so the easy solution is, of course, a lengthy bombardment of intense monster-mash- robot-high-tech extravaganza. In addition to this, it doesn't really have much potential to be a movie that you remember for being very distinct (giant monsters trying to destroy the world, mankind desperately defending itself, etc). And as for what the characters goes, You hardly remember them by the time the credits are done. There's no time to bond with them in any way between all the fighting scenes. If you can't really bring yourself to care about whether the monsters or the humans win in the end, you know something has gone wrong. Pacific Rim has fallen into the CG-trap, emphasizing visuals and forgetting about the story. Someone are sure to be blown away by all this, if they are into that sort of movies. I for one, was not.","

"tadpole-596-918256","12 September 2013",". . . as to be contending with giant Bio-robots from a poorly-explained intra-galactic wormhole. What all these directors of post-apocalyptic flicks seem not to realize is there comes a point where our world gets so destroyed that the viewer really stops caring about its fate--unless the characters are truly compelling. The latter was the case with ALIEN, made for $11 million in 1979 with the tag line ""In space, no one can hear you scream,"" plus a cast including Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm, John Hurt (the ELEPHANT MAN himself), Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphet Kotto. By contrast, the makers of PACIFIC RIM (tag line: ""To fight monsters, we created monsters."") obviously did not spend as high a percentage--compared to ALIEN--of their $190 million budget to hire Charlie Hunnam, Diego Klattenhoff, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, and Charlie Day, who fail miserably to make us really care about what happens to them--or their world. All of the humanity in PACIFIC RIM would fit in the little finger of the 1999 science fiction cartoon, THE IRON GIANT. As a robot movie, PACIFIC RIM is to last year's ROBOT & FRANK as the 2008 THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is to its 1951 model. Even CLOVERFIELD has more heart than PACIFIC RIM, which made me really miss the charismatic bugs from the original STARSHIP TROOPERS.","

Yes, the effects are pretty and there is some good ol' action going on, but the rest of it feels just pretty awful, in short: Guillermo del Toro on the trail of Roland Emmerich. My verdict: boring with the exception of the action scenes. My solution: I wouldn't make a directors cut but an action cut - cut all those boring filler scenes, and put everything that got some explosions and gunfire going on together to a non-stop Pacific Rim action pack together - it would be a way better and more honest movie.","

I'm no expert on CGI but at least to my untrained eye the special effects looked great. It was fun watching the mechanicals of the robots and the various weapons of the robots and the monsters. The fight scenes were exciting and the set designs were realistic. Movie-dom has come a long since the late fifties where men wearing Godzilla suits destroyed paper-mache' cities.Yes, the acting is far from first-rate and the dialogue is clichÃ©d. But I didn't watch this movie to see Lawrence Olivier quality acting or Shakespearean dialogue, that would almost be out of place for an action movie like this. It would be like going to Ruby Tuesdays for a meal served on one-thousand dollar a plate china.As a side note, I'm surprised this movie isn't a bigger money-maker. At a 180 mil.+ budget they have to sell a lot of tickets. Maybe the rental and foreign markets can take up the slack. A movie like this should be a bonanza for marketing with toys, video games, t-shirts, lunch boxes, etc. I don't have TV but if the makers didn't have a tie-in to a fast-food restaurant chain with small action figures included with ""Happy-Meals"" then they missed a good opportunity to lure the kids and their parents to the local multi-plex. So I would be surprised if this movie doesn't turn a profit, at least eventually. Speaking of kids, this sixty-year old was a ten year old again bringing back fond memories of monster movies I watched back in the fifties and sixties.","

"dewetnmail","31 July 2013","This week I watched Nelson Mandela pilot a giant robot in order to fight monsters in Guillermo del Toro's, Pacific RimÂ Okay, not quite.Pacific Rim is visually unparalleled in the kick-ass-destructive-giant-robots-meet-alien- monster-mash-up movie genre. It's one of the very few movies where the 3D was done with such an art that you can't help but marvel at how amazing and effective it is. You see, the problem with the 3D gimmick is that it normally takes your eyes at least as long as the opening scene to acclimatize to the 3D, which is a waste if you consider that you're watching a film at almost triple what it would normally cost you. Plus, you're wearing awkward plastic goggles on your face which only seem to dim the brightness of the screen.In Pacific Rim there are a number of devices implemented to re-enforce the 3D effect with intelligently placed objects that work to refresh the neutral depthâwhich basically means you don't have to take your glasses off every 20 minutes or so. Bottom line: the 3D in Pacific Rim is worth its price.If you thought you saw the entire film when you watched the trailer, you are very much mistaken. Apart from two clips, the trailer only covers the events in the first 25-minute opening sequence. Pacific Rim is a lot larger than what I expected! True to del Toro form, Pacific Rim has a lot of depth and isn't simply a film with a narrow backbone to carry a visual and action-filled spectacle. Guillermo del Toro has already voiced his plans for a sequel, and, after watching the first film, it looks like it's going to be on par with the best of them.Pacific Rim is a must-see film! It's more mature and polished than the Transformers franchise and easily the best film I've seen this year.","

"giorgiothesmurf","12 July 2013","The Good: The action sequences was spectacular, I loved it!! The CGI was epic and not cheesy like World War Z! Guillermo Del Toro brought the Jaegers into the big screen with strength and action. The Kaijus looked awesome! The relationship between Raleigh and Mako. Hong Kong looked fantastic in this movie! The fighting between Jaegers and Kaijus in the ocean while it's raining. The storyline was something we haven't seen for a long time. It felt like a Japanese film with great action.The Bad: The characters needed more story. Not much to say...Go watch this film with your friends and have a great time!! Rating: 9.25/10","

"andrea-hartline","15 July 2013","Decided to go see after reading so many user reviews of 8, 9 and 10. Absolutely love movies in this genre as well other movies that Del Toro has directed (e.g. Pan's Labyrinth, the Devils Backbone, Hellboy) I was expecting to be blown away - and yet, at one point during movie husband and I contemplated leaving. I don't understand how so much money can be spent and effort not made to create coherent script with believable characters. I can accept campiness if its done well - but the two scientists for example were just ridiculous.The amazing visual effects were what kept us in the theater - but just barley. Could clearly see Del Toro's mastery in the creation of the aliens and Jaegers.","

"InMatiasWeTrust","10 July 2013","I was lucky to catch an advance screening of Pacific Rim & I went into Pacific Rim excited, ready to see Giant Robots take on 3000 ton monsters & left completely satisfied. This movie turned out better than I expected, Pacific Rim is the best summer movie so far. The action delivers, whenever there's a kaiju/Jaeger fight scene you wont be able to take your eye's off the screen. Great visuals. Good plot. Solid acting. The character development is fair. Pacific Rim is overall a fun/good time movie that will bring out the inner 9 year in ya. If you're going into Pacific Rim expecting an Oscar worthy performance & plot, well sorry... Guillermo del Toro hit it out of the park with Pacific Rim & as I mentioned the visuals are great so definitely give this one a look at in 3D & if there's an iMAX near your area GO FOR IT! P.S stay for the after credits.","

This sci-fi movie is about a fissure in the ocean floor, not one's anus.Under attack from colossal sea-creatures, the military constructs Jaegars, large-scale automatons controlled by pilots, Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) and Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff), to fight back.But overtime their armour becomes obsolete and other avenues are pursued.With months left in operation, Commander Stacker (Idris Elba) initiates a final mission to detonate a warhead in the monster's portico.Recruiting Raleigh and pairing him with an orphan (Rinko Kikuchi), Stacker has one last chance to destroy the ever-adapting enemy.Guillermo del Toro's ode to Godzilla and Gundam, Pacific Rim's best moments are its bombastic battles, while its worst are when the leads are outside their suits.Furthermore, if giant monsters are anything like us, can you imagine the kinky things they'd do with a life-sized robot?Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com","

"Radu_A","28 July 2013","A lot's been said, personally I felt PR to be the most entertaining summer film so far. It was definitely worth the 3D extra charge, and should definitely be seen in a theater - without a first-class sound system and on a smaller screen, there's not much point in watching this.Since PR is Hollywood's first deep dive into the mecha (fighting robot) world, those of you who are not too fascinated by things Japanese may not know where much of the inspiration for this came from. So here's a few anime tips in case you got curious. In a way, the B.O. indicates that this kind of thing may work better with audiences in the animated form.Everybody in the world should be familiar with Evangelion. Then again, the original is from 1995-96, so some younger folks may not be. The 'Eva' mecha are the obvious inspiration for the Jaeger's design. Three visually updated relaunch movies have been released: 'Evangelion 1.0. You are not alone' (2007), www.imdb.com/title/tt0923811, 'Evangelion 2.0. You can (not) advance' (2009), www.imdb.com/title/tt0860906, and 'Evangelion 3.0: You can (not) redo' (2012), www.imdb.com/title/tt0860907. The films are less philosophical than the original 26 episode series. For that reason, however, it's the perfect introduction to mecha anime for anyone who's enjoyed PR, but found the story too flat/silly.Similar mecha anime with better stories would be 'Aquarion' (2005, 26 episodes, same 'fusion of mecha pilots' angle), 'Broken Blade' (2010-11, 6 OVAs, fantasy mecha battle epic with the same melodrama), the highly recommended 'Code Geass' (2008/2012, 50 episodes, alternative evil empire history with super powers), 'Gargantia' (2013, 13 episodes, similar monsters), and 'Macross Frontier' (2008-09, 26 episodes, similar monsters with space opera and singing).If you're looking for an anime currently airing which best defines the difference between this entertainment form and film, has an interesting story and is recklessly cool, try 'Attack on Titan' (www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140). Be warned, you may be hooked and become a J-nerd yourself. But don't resist the fun, go with the zeitgeist.","

"alex_howells92","20 May 2014","When i first saw the trailer for Pacific Rim i thought this film was going to be mental! Having giant robots and monsters fight isn't something I've seen since i was a kid watching Mighty Morphin Power Rangers so i couldn't wait to see this film, As a kid i loved stuff like Power Rangers, Transformers, Godzilla and all that and i'm a fan of Guillermo Del Toro as well. I enjoyed both Hellboy films, Pans Labyrinth and Blade 2 so i had faith that this film would be something special. When the film finally came out I went to see it as soon as I could, After watching the trailers I was expecting an all out action / Sci-Fi with good fight scenes and a cool story that kept me interested through out and kept me entertained. This film did exactly that! I was glad to see that this film doesn't take itself to serious and has fun with all the crazy Sci-Fi stuff they have. There wasn't much with this film i didn't enjoy but this is a list of the stuff i liked about Pacific Rim -* The whole concept and theme of this film, It was like re-living my childhood and getting excited when you know theirs going to be a huge fight at the end of a Power Rangers episode. You know this is going to be a huge CGI fest so you don't need a believable story or to much character development, Its just feeling entertained by watching giant robots punch monsters in the face!* The visual effects were outstanding, The use of colour and the way the Jaegers looked as they moved. Comparing them to the only other CGI robots i can think of, Micheal Bays Transformers, The Jaegers move around better and feel a lot more robot like to the Transformers and the colour schemes used on them were much more interesting. The Kaiju looked amazing as well! each one had its own unique look and strengths and the use of CGI really enhances it.* The soundtrack was epic, You knew when they main theme song came on you know their was going to be something epic about to happen.* The Jaegers, I was glad to that each Jaeger was unique to itself and they all had different kind of abilities and looks and they all had really cool names. I thought the main Jaeger 'Gypsy Danger' was pretty cool looking, He had cool elbow rockets that made the fight scene that little bit more enjoyable and a cool looking sword that could have been introduced in the first fight but was still cool when he got it out, 'Crimson Typhoon' had a third arm, 'Striker Eureka' to me looked very similar to Gundam Wing and 'Cherno Alpha' was this huge Russian Jaeger that was pretty cool!* The time Gypsy Danger uses a freighter like a crow-bar on one of the Kaiju!* The Kaiju, They all looked so good! each of them were like giant amphibious creatures that literally just want to destroy stuff! Since these creatures seem to put up a fight to normal military equipment you know theirs going to be a cool fight waiting for them when the Jaegers get about. * I really liked Charlie Day as one of the scientists working on Kaiju, He was probably my favourite character though the whole film.* Idris Elba, I'm a fan of him, I don't think I've ever seen him in a role i haven't enjoyed and he gives one of the coolest speeches in seen in a film in a long time. * The dog! One of the Jaeger pilots have this unbelievably cute dog which i loved seeing on screen!There were a few things that stopped me from giving this film 10 stars, stuff like -* I found Raleigh's accent pretty annoying, i got used to it after a while but yeah, its pretty annoying.* The syncing two pilots together in order to get a Jaeger to work. A big chunk of the middle of this film was about getting the Mako Mori to sync up with Raleigh Beckett, I didn't quite get why those two could be drift compatible, i thought it was only for family members. During the beginning i pretty sure Raleigh pilots it on his own when his Brother dies. I didn't get it, But it still looks Cool!* I found it to be painfully slow when the Jaegers had to move quickly or had to charge up their plasma cannons, It felt like the Kaiju were much quicker that them.* During fights with the Jaegers and the Kaiju they kept jumping from scenes into the Cockpit to hear the pilots speaking, I didn't mind it to much but i would of preferred to see more robot monster fight scenes. Overall it was still a cool film and if you enjoyed Power Rangers and Godzilla as a kid your inner child will love this film! This film deserves to have a good few sequels since the universe they've made has so many opportunities to make more! If your looking for a film with giant monsters and giant robots this is the film for you!","

"HideousHades-753-960378","3 August 2013","When I first heard of Pacific Rim, I wasn't expecting much. A film about gigantic robots fighting enormous aliens? An apocalypse that must be ""cancelled""? When I entered the theatre, I prepared myself for a generic over-the-top, badly-executed blockbuster, loosely based on the Transformers franchise. Fortunately for my brain cells, this wasn't the case. When a film is executed properly, viewers are allowed to forget any plot weaknesses and just enjoy the film. Certain films are easier to pull off than others, depending on the complexity, originality, and strength of the plot. A film about an imminent alien invasion and a resistance of gigantic robots is certainly difficult to pull off, but Guillermo del Toro dismissed this disadvantage and executed Pacific Rim perfectly. The writing was quite decent, the costume and set designs were brilliant, the special effects were incredible, and the acting was a cut above blockbuster standards. Not to mention the pacing, which was perfect and kept me captivated throughout. Because of this, the generic plot was easy to overlook. Despite the mediocre plot, many clichÃ©s were purposefully cast aside. For example, in one scene, Raleigh Becket (Hunnam) says ""let's check for a pulse"" and incinerates a monster that could have been alive. A clichÃ© that I see in many action films is the following: an enemy rises up and attacks the main character from behind after the main character thinks that it is dead. However, Del Toro skillfully avoided this tiresome clichÃ©, and added some comic relief in the process. Pacific Rim didn't contain much of a romance subplot, either, and Raleigh Becket's partner (Rinko Kakuchi) wasn't portrayed as a beauty model (a ridiculous archetype that I hate). At first glance, one might think that Pacific Rim has no underlying theme. It could be considered a film featuring nothing more than mindless violence, and completely centred around robots fighting aliens. While this is true to a certain extent, cooperation was a large part of Pacific Rim - two pilots in each robot, thousands of scientists and engineers collaborating with each other, and hundreds of nations pooling their resources to build the Jaegers. Pacific Rim stands out among many other blockbusters as a film which actually tried to contain a message. In conclusion, Del Toro executed Pacific Rim brilliantly. Some of the casting was great, including Idris Elba as Stacker Pentacost, and Rinko Kakuchi as Mako Mori. The music, special effects and pacing are so incredible that you'll have no trouble overlooking the plot's mediocrity. I would give Pacific Rim a rating of 9.3/10, with points taken off for a weak plot, some mediocre performances, and a few lame lines here and there. However, there are plenty of redeeming factors, and the film is entertaining to boot. If you're worried because this film looks like Transformers, you're making a huge mistake. Watch it yourself - you won't be disappointed!-Neo Stark","

"GirishGowda","20 October 2013","When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.I knew what one could expect from a monsters v/s robots movie, but was very excited to see a popcorn flick directed by Del Toro even after reading middling reviews about it. Well, I drifted to sleep twice while watching the movie and had to go back to see what I missed. Finally realized I could miss nothing since anyone could easily predict every beat of the story since its the most clichÃ©d movie ever. This is a movie that's dedicated to the mechanical aspects of its futuristic technology while forgetting about its narrative core. It could have been a fun ride though, but the movie didn't even try. I just couldn't take the bland and annoying 'acting', the boringly derivative plot line and the lack of even the most basic of intelligence or common sense at display in the movie. I don't even understand how Idris Elba is praised for his acting in one of his TV shows, Luther, if this is the kind of intensity he brings to the table. Simply put, he's terrible here and the rest are nipping at his heels for the Worst Actor Award.There wasn't any need to portray the world leaders as ignorant morons when the ridiculous 'wall' was their most logically sound plan to run with. But, there needed to be a contrived debacle for our heroes to overcome just like the modern blockbuster handbook dictates and decent character development be damned. There are a couple of positives though. The female lead Rinko Kikuchi, thankfully is not just a love interest and has her own little truly frightening story. Also, I thought that the massive battles were done really well, no matter the inherent logical fallacies. This is a cgi-lover's wet dream come true. What was unbelievable was that this mediocrity (at best) was directed by the master storyteller Guillermo Del Toro, the same man who brought us Pan's Labyrinth, The Devil's Backbone and Hellboy. It has a theme of humanity working together to overcome a seemingly impossible alien problem and has shots of a grand scale, but the auteur in Del Toro is hidden and everything feels small and contrived. Unless you haven't seen many monster blockbusters or don't mind wasting a couple of hours, ignore this at all costs. This is just another glorified two-hour long commercial for toys and a push to expand Hollywood's movies in the Asian territory (which worked since Pacific Rim tanked in the US, but was saved by its worldwide collections). If Michael Bay's name was stamped on the same movie instead of Del Toro's, I imagine there would have been even more deserved backlash to the final product. Baby Kaiju should have just swallowed this movie instead of swallowing that man.4/10","

"forcefromabove","9 September 2013","If you are looking for a deep and twisting plot, an amazing love story, incredible realism, or a deep character development, watch a different movie.If you want bad-ass 25-30 story tall robots fighting bad-ass 25-30 story tall sea monsters, YOU'RE IN LUCK! The plot is simple. Monsters come from the ocean and attack humanity, repeatedly, until humanity says screw it lets build giant robots to fight these monsters.The majority of the movie is a well made action movie with the feeling of Godzilla. The monsters (known as Kaiju which is Japanese for monsters) are beautiful looking and all incredibly different with their own personality. The robots (known as Jaegars which is German for hunter or huntsman)are all incredibly powerful looking with their own personality and individuality as well.If you want to watch a movie that will make your jaw drop from incredible, powerful, gigantic action then you HAVE to watch this movie. If that doesn't interest you then this movie won't interest you. I highly recommend watching this movie if any sort monster vs anything action interests you.","

"blackmamba99971","25 August 2013","Well this is a turn of events. A movie about humongous robots doing the work at the behest of pilots who must align themselves with each other mentally for the behemoth to work properly. In other words, if you lose the alignment, you die. Or at least won't work half way. Pacific rim is about a breach in subspace on earth deep in the oceans.All of the united nations combined work together to build large robots so that they can fight on equal grounds. Yet I felt this film has too many clichÃ©s to be desired. Such as monsters fighting against robots, which to me looks like a tech-no poised godzilla against mothra kind of thing. Also the idea of fighting these creatures to stop them from colonizing earth and moving on to the next, has a flavor of independence day. Plus - - the cloned monsters themselves were pregnant, again, godzilla hinted. This did have a good amount of special effects, but the story was not all that original. I liked the actors, but truthfully the explosions and destruction was way over the top. Although the idea for this was because of the creatures invading earth. Each one the size of a building. In that aspect, I can agree using robots was a nice approach. But the overtones of creatures, pregnancy, even the breach to another dimension in its own right has another flavor such as Cloverfield. If you broke it all down, it is different movies wrapped into one cluster. And in that sense, it lost its potency. It was a good summer filler, nothing more. But it did push the actors forwards to doing other films.It is good to see new faces.I just hope they pick the right roles.","

"Vartiainen","5 September 2016","Having re-watched this movie, I can say with certainty that Guillermo del Toro has created something quite rare and wonderful here: an honest adventure film that in no way shies away from what it is and is none the worse for it.I think that many of us saw the trailers and become excited yet hesitant because surely it couldn't be as good as we were promised. Surely the film would focus too much on the political machinations of the evil government, or too much on the romance between our protagonists. Or the action would be too blurry, or there would be too little of it. Surely this kind of movie wouldn't be allowed to be ""just"" about giant mechas fighting giant godzilla-monsters.And sure, there is some talk about governments, the protagonists are a man and a woman. But it's a movie about giant mechas fighting godzilla-monsters. There's nothing impure about that. It's what the movie is, simple as that. And it is fantastic! The action scenes are phenomenal. Vibrant with colours, beautifully executed, each unique and exciting to follow, with no shaky-cam, or needless bleakness, or annoying side characters butting in with one-liners.And it's more than that. There is an actual story in this film. Granted, it's a simple story about humanity rising against a common threat, with no big surprises or twists on the horizon. But, quite frankly, that's more than enough. The characters and their actors are of excellent quality, which breathes life into the story, giving it the depth it needs to elevate this film above a simple actionfest. And it does avoid or sidestep some obvious clichÃ©s quite beautifully, earning it some extra brownie points.Do you like robots? Do you like monsters? Does the idea of them fighting one another excite you? Then see this film. It's all you'd ever want, and more.","

"FilmEspen1990","5 August 2013","When Guillermo del Toro set out to create Pacific Rim he drew inspiration from Francisco Goya's ""The Colossus"" and said that the he wanted to give the audience the same ""feel of awe"" in the battles between Kaiju and Jaeger. And he most certainly succeeded at that! This movie not only gives you some of the best action sequences any movie has offered up this year, it also delivers spectacularly in both the narrative structure, and characterization. The characterization is done primarily through ""the drift"" and it's inclusion is just a stroke of genius.In short, to pilot a Jaeger you need two pilots, since it is far to much neural interface for one brain to handle. These pilots need to be in ""synch"" so that their movements are matched. To get synced they literally have to meld their minds and then gain access to both the thoughts and memories of each other, and through great visual effects you learn a lot about your heroes simply by the movie showing it to you.Another thing that surprised me about this movie is just how well thought out most of it is. Kaiju priesthoods? Kaiju body parts marked? Science departments dedicated to the study of Kaiju? This movie has it all.With Pacific Rim, Guillermo del Toro not only gives you the best robot monster mash-up since, well, ever. He also shows just how much thought there has been put into this. Del Toro has made a concept that sounds stupid, into a clever movie. And in a well made universe, and with a believable structure. He also shows that a movie can still be simple, and clever at the same time. Pacific Rim is to me without a doubt the best summer movie of 2013, and i mean that not just as in entertainment value.This movie, is Awesome!","

Guillermo del Toro's epic valentine to giant monsters run amok horror films is a hybrid of sci-fi including ""Godzilla"", ""Inception"" and take your pick of any Ray Harryhausen fantasy with a touch of HP Lovecraft: set in the future Earth finds itself under siege from ginormous alien monsters from an underwater chasm unleashing hellspawns forcing humanity to combat with equally humongous tech savvy robots in a fight to the finish. While its tin-eared dialogue is on par with James Cameron (del Toro collaborating with Travis Beacham), the visual f/x are pretty awesome with its splendidly over-the-top gargantuan bitch slapping over worldwide metropolises and severely major property damage. The behemoth beasties are truly amazing in their looks suggesting Disney's ""Night on Bald Mountain"" from ""FANTASIA"" meets the Mos Eisley cantina denizens of ""Star Wars"".","

But to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.I came very close to walking out. And the only other time I've done that is watching Adam Sandler's ""Don't Mess With The Zohan"". That's how bad it is.Visually, it's on a huge scale and is nothing you've seen before. It deserves some plaudits for that. Rinko Kikuchi put in a decent performance (at least when compared to her fellow cast members)But the poor acting, cringe-worthy dialogue, lazy characterisation, sad attempts at ""comic relief"", incoherent storyline and gaping plot holes do not make up for the cool effects. And to be honest, after the first 20 minutes or so, you kind of know what you're going to get for the rest of the movie.I know it's a big blockbusting summer popcorn movie, and I usually LOVE that stuff. But this was lazy. When 95% of your time is on the effects and 5% is on the rest, you're going to get a crappy film, and that's exactly what you get here.","

Pacific Rim has a well balanced story and Effects combo that carries you with it.The story takes it's time to build up but the movies starts straight in with action and grabs your attention straight away and you can't help keeping on watching to find out what the hell is going on. The comedy geeks were a good addition in my opinion deviating slightly from action and sad background stories.And the action sequences!!! Well they were pretty damn good to say the least. Picture a transformers fight where you can see every single move perfectly, a combination of wrestling and martial arts. If anyone remembers the power rangers zord mode, well the sync inside between the pilots looks the same but cooler and less cheesy. The acting was AMAZING!!!!! Idris Elba was perfectly cast to deliver those lines with a punch (couldn't help but think of him in Luther in some scenes!!) The other actors carried their roles with panache and depth which made it more believable.All in all a good action story which I would easily watch again!!!","

"juneebuggy","27 February 2016","This was big, loud and occasionally entertaining while dazzling with huge, crazy battle scenes. A visual spectacle in that regard but style more than substance. The story is predictable once it establishes itself and Charlie Hunnam has several shirtless scenes (for no reason I can think of other than to make (me) happy.) Nobody else takes their shirt off in the movie. I also wondered what the point was of having a stick fight training scene other than well, yum. It serves no purpose for operating the giant robots.Hunnam's voice-over establishes the world this movie takes place in and does a great job in conveying the scope of a film. The story follows a burned out pilot and an inexperienced rookie who are forced to work together piloting massive human controlled robots to save the world from giant monsters that have risen from the sea.I can see that there would be a definite audience for this type of movie as it looks like 'Transformers', 'Ironman', 'Battleship' etc, where the story is sort of inconsequential as its all about the huge special effects and CGI. Ultimately this wasn't for me but I knew that going in ""Transformers vs Godzilla"" is not my thing, I just figured with Idris Elba and Charlie Hunnam attached they could help me eye candy my way through it which they did 1/19/16","

"nick-1896","6 October 2013","Big giant robots punching big giant aliens in the face. Even with this puerile premise you'd think with the millions of dollars at Del Toro's disposal, he could've come up with something better than this mental diarrhea. With every clichÃ© in the book, combined with every Del Toro clichÃ© in the book, it's not only a crap-fest plot-wise, it's also visually awful. In one frame everyone's bathed in blue light. Next it's yellow, then it's red. As if it was not only written by an 8-year old, but filmed by one too. There's inappropriate steampunk sets, all of Del Toro's favourite 'actors' doing their best wood impressions and so many bad computer graphics you can virtually see the mouse pointer hovering over the screen. There is nothing in this film to recommend it. How it's garnered a score above 7 is beyond me. I guess Hollywood's squeezing out so many turds at the moment, audiences are just getting used to the taste.","

"prothessden","24 August 2013","Story?Did you call it a story?I think it is just an excuse for marvelous giant robots vs giant monsters battles.Pacific Rim isn't really telling a story,however,it's realizing our childhood dreams.When the Japanese monster movies were hot,many kids must had dreamed of giant monsters.Due to the limit of technology in the 90's,monsters were no more than plastic toys destroying model cities with dumb movements.But I remember that my childhood friends and I talked about monster movies each time we played together and the fun pretending to be monsters smashing things and got punished for that.I guess boys have inborn interests in monsters. After seeing Pacific Rim,I couldn't help crying. Isn't it what we dreamed of when we were kids?Giant monsters smashing a city to rubble,giant robots punching monsters with a fist bigger than a bus and hero saving the world again.All in one,all in almost realistic CG which gave me an illusion that monsters were alive and kicking. Pacific Rim is the best monster movies I've ever seen.Please support the movie or monster movies will extinct.","

"lasttimeisaw","7 August 2013","Del Toro's latest tentpole, watched in 3D format on IMAX screen, a substantial SFX Jarger Vs. Kaiju monolith which makes TRANSFORMER franchise pale in comparison. But the feeble storyline and unimaginative character-building drags the film into a scrape of torpor. especially after the seasonal actioners' drumfire (after WHITE HOUSE DOWN 2013, 6/10 and FAST AND FURIOUS 6 2013. 6/10), PACIFIC RIM is the most costly one, and its red-hot accomplishment in the Chinese box office suggests a belated chance to break even its tepid reception in the North American domain, with its Japan opening this coming weekend, an approximate $400,000,000 worldwide turnover may green-light a sequel for its ardent followers. The 3D effect surely doesn't improve at all thanks to the murky palette of the raining night combat and underwater location, under the 3D monopoly (even more absurd there are 4D version available in theaters) at least in China, we have no access to the plain 2D type, which rumor says its rendition is much better in an IMAX screen. Dedicated to Japanese Tokusatsu films, Del Toro and his crew's reconstruction and invention of genre is groundbreaking, an eye- opener with excellent technical scrupulousness, the bombarding sound effects are overwhelming as well as its awe-inspiring and heroic battle scenes. There are some hiccups keep bugging me, an obvious one is that why on earth there is no conventional weaponry assistance engaging in the doomsday battle, not even as the cannon fodder; another one is the last moment sword stunt, saving the best for the last may not work here, it is only for practicability, but an ill-considered one. Hunnam doesn't possess enough charisma to carry on the film on his shoulder and his platonic relation with Kikuchi hasn't been dug deep enough to steal the limelight. Other actors are standard equipments, Elba is the commander whose background story desperately needs a prequel. Day is the comic relief and Perlman is the egomaniac laughing-stock. Del Toro's Hollywood odyssey has been rougher than one had presumed, PACIFIC RIM is a qualified film in the sense of it is an updated product for the genre criterion (let's wait and see how GODZILLA will handle the challenge next year), but it doesn't live up to Del Toro's talent if one familiars with his earlier films, notably his homespun masterpiece PAN'S LABYRINTH (2006, 9/10), where mythology and reality have been miraculously criss-crossed and not only our eyes are being opened, our hearts are also being filled with passion and vibration.","

"jacobse-07697","5 August 2019","Pacific Rim is one of my favorite movies. It has a great value of rewatch ability, and the special effects and music are some of the best of all time. Uprising wasn't the worst movie, but it didn't do the series justice. What Del Toro established was loosely based off of a lot of Japanese's comics and cartoons, but executed in an ultra realistic way. Everything from the water the Jaegers waded through to the epic fight scenes. Ramin Djwadi did an absolutely fantastic job with the ost. You may recognize him from iron man and game of thrones. The actors also did a great job. The lead actor was the weakest in my opinion. All of the supporting actors did a spectacular, though. (Charlie Day, Ron Perlman) I give this movie a 10 out of 10 mainly to balance things out. I believe it should be at least a 7.5 or 8.","

In fact, if I didn't know beforehand and I was given 10 other options, I would never bet this was by the Mexican director.The film recomposes itself and improves towards the end. The action is good and the special effects fantastic, but this plot is one of the most bloated that can exist. Bad characters can do nothing to hide a bad cast that doesn't work in many circumstances, including the main lead.The soundtrack is quite interesting and there are two or three actors trying to save the day and manage to grab the pieces, but nothing justifies that a movie about monsters and robots can be sometimes so boring.My least favourite Del Toro film. It might get better with a rewatch and low expectations.","

"valadas","5 October 2022","If you love horror and science fiction movies you'll love this one because it has both ingredients galore and technically shown with great proficiency and skill particularly the fights, battles and chases in powerful images and scenes. If you don't love this kind of movies it's better you don't watch it and do something else more pleasant because the story is common and almost poor. The Kaiju monsters come through a rift in the ocean bottom and invade the earth,. Killing people and destroying everything. Since the usual weapons were not enough efficient to fight these monsters, machine monsters with human shape were built, called the Jaegers, that were piloted by two famous pilots and start fighting the Kaiju monsters. But since this was not successful after all, the solution found after a lot of complicated actions was to make a nuclear bomb to explode on the rift and close it. This was the big and successful solution in the end, to avoid more killings and destructions. So besides the technically extremely good movie the rest is not particularly attractive to film lovers.","

"hiseinman","11 July 2013","""The Pacific line"" is very pleased with me as a summer blockbuster. Similar premiere last year only disappointing at best just left a good impression. Recall the ""Battleship"" with a great start and sunken finale. ""Oblivion"" was worthy of a fantasy, but without claiming to be religious. I can not believe that the script for the ""turn of the Pacific"" was written by Travis Beacham, who also labored over the ""Battle of the Titans"", where the actual battle of the titans I never saw. I saw a real battle today, where huge robots fighting with monstrous monsters from a parallel universe. That's really the scale!From the first frame of the movie is steeped in history which began the extermination of humanity. There are no mysteries with a spectacular appearance in ""Godzilla."" All at once simple and clear. Elaborate figures as monsters and robots are staggering. Contractions are varied and unpredictable. The brain is not overloaded due to blurred shots when the huge devastation. Highly developed and detailed interiors, detailed drawing of the robot-rangers. From the point of view of all the pictures are just perfect.Also, the story does not disappoint. In principle, most of the predictable, but Guillermo del Toro tried to make the audience does not get bored while watching. That was it. Really looks the same breath. The acting for the sci-fi movie with a plot very worthy.Music sets the mood for epic. You feel the imminent end of humanity. In general, an adequate response to the recent zombie apocalypse.8 out of 10P.S. Most worried about the Japanese girl with the red shoes.","

He seemed to think he was making a story of valiant underdogs struggling against the odds. I can suspend disbelief and enjoy a movie fantasy as well as the next guy, but even for mindless entertainment, this is mindless. A hundred million dollars buys a lot of computer generated imagery, but that seems to be all it bought. The dialogue is just plain dire, a string of clichÃ©s, including the required ""noooooo!"". The acting is wooden, but with a script like this you can't expect much else. I just don't get how you can be given so much money for a project and produce something with so little impact. Hollywood has got to get past its green screens and start writing some stories to go with all the CGI.","

"brando647","25 January 2014","With all of the sequels, prequels, and remakes that flooded movie theaters in the summer of 2013, you would think audiences would be hungry for something original. Guillermo Del Toro, a modern cinematic visionary, does just that and creates an homage to Japanese giant monster films with PACIFIC RIM and the nation responds with a near universal shrug of disinterest and barely half of it's budget in box office returns. Thankfully, the movie found some massive love overseas and made a nice profit so as to not discourage Del Toro from any future endeavors (or any studios from hiring him again). While my daughter has become a fan of the early Godzilla films, I was never a fan of the Japanese kaiju genre and the closest I ever came was watching the Power Rangers as a child. But I know a good time when I see one and I knew a modern movie about giant robots battling giant monsters from the man who did BLADE II and the HELLBOY movies was worth checking out. The premise is simple enough: giant monsters dubbed Kaiju begin emerging from an interdimensional fissure on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. In an effort to combat these beasts, the human race has united in a program of constructing giant robots known as Jaegers, mentally controlled by two pilots. The movie is set more than a decade into the Kaiju war and we're on the losing end as the Kaiju attacks become more and more persistent. The Jaeger program is being shut down to reallocate the funds into creating giant coastal walls, but Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), the man in charge of the Jaeger program, isn't ready give in. He recruits Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), a former Jaeger pilot with a tragic past, for one last mission in hopes of ending the war once and for all.I know there's a load of people out there shouting about how this movie isn't original and it ripped it this anime and that anime, and I don't care. I don't watch anime. I'm know Del Toro was heavily inspired by anime (he's a huge fan) and I'm more than happy to just revel in the love letter he's written to these Japanese genres in the form of PACIFIC RIM. It's not a great movie, but it's a pretty good one regardless. It's fun, visually gorgeous, and it's got some fantastic battle sequences, even if its story and characters are all pretty basic and shallow. This movie is eye candy, but it's epic level eye candy. The visual effects are spectacular and the movie's focal points, the Kaiju and Jaegers, are fantastically designed. Each of the robots and creatures has a unique design to stand out from the others though I only wish we'd had an opportunity to see them battle in broad daylight where we could truly appreciate all of the detail that went into them. Every battle happens at night, in rainstorms, etc. It's a missed opportunity and the closest we get is a nice series of shots of a Kaiju rampaging in Sydney, Australia. The entire movie is filled with vibrant colors and it's all beautifully shot. The film was shot by cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and, if you're familiar with any of his previous work, you know to expect good things. PACIFIC RIM is, if nothing else, a visual feast with some brutal robot-on-monster battle action.The rest of the film's elements are where it stumbles a bit. The cast is filled with an eclectic mix of talent. You've got Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi are the film's heroes who suffer from a lack of decent chemistry. As the pilots of our hero Jaeger, Gypsy Danger, they're our main focus. They've got a bit of depth to them with a little backstory behind them to explain why Raleigh (Hunnam) wants to avoid the Jaeger program and Mako (Kikuchi) wants so desperately to be a part of it. Unfortunately, I never felt much of a real spark between them. Idris Elba is the grizzled commander in charge of the Jaeger initiative. Elba is a talented man and provides one of the stronger performances as he riles up a passion in the men under his command to fight. We get comic relief in the form of the Jaeger program's science team, Newt (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman), and Del Toro regular Ron Perlman has a sweet supporting role as a black market peddler of Kaiju remains. None of the characters are mind-blowingly developed but there's enough behind each of them to give them some motivation. The plot is paper thin: beat the monsters and destroy the source. There wasn't much effort put into plot elements, as this movie is all about the action. This means the section in the middle of the film while Raleigh and the rest of the Jaeger program ready for their final mission tends to drag. It's all about character development at that point and the characters were totally outshined by the robots/monsters so that's what we're aching to see by that point. Once the action kicks into gear in Hong Kong, it's all up hill from there.PACIFIC RIM is spectacle cinema and it's a blast to watch, especially on the big screen. It's not an overly intelligent film and you're probably best off shutting down your mind, munching on some popcorn, and taking in the killer visuals. It's a fun experience I'm happy Del Toro got his love letter to Japanese giant monsters out of his system because he's still got a dozen other projects on his agenda that I'm excited about.","

"valiantvu","14 December 2013","The overly dramatic acting and dialogue hits you right off the bat in Pacific Rim, but if you can laugh through this then you can enjoy the incredible CG that comprises the bulk of the film. Pure-action-crappy-everything-else films rarely entertain me all the way through, but my eyes couldn't help feasting on the fight scenes between the incredibly detailed Kaiju and the shiny, badass Jaegers.Each fight takes it up a notch, progressing from the first ""fist"" fight intro to fights with a frickin awesome sword, cargo ships, flying Kaiju, and so on. One of my favorite scenes was when the Kaiju baby bursts out of its dead mother and then chokes itself on its umbilical cord. I really loved the design of all the Kaijus and how they were each very different. Serious kudos to the CG artists and animators - I especially liked the bioluminescence element they added.As for the plot and characters, they were totally absurd. The one working defense system that the international community has pooled their resources into has two scientists - TWO - that no provides resources or listens to. Stacker, the commanding officer, only pauses once in a while to yell ""SHUT UP!"" at them. There was some pretty crappy acting by the two leads, but watching it in conjunction with the absurdity of all of the other characters, dialogue, and plot, just made everything funnier.If I had watched this in theaters, I probably would've been groaning to myself through the whole film, but being able to joke and laugh through a lot of the scenes, I found myself thoroughly enjoying it and appreciating the aspects that were truly well done.","

"dragonmysterious","20 July 2013","The plot of this movie is not as simple as just Godzilla vs Transformers/Power Rangers, however, it is also not as complex as Oblivion. Ron Perlman and Idris Elba were the ones who stole the show. Ron Perlman, despite appearing only after half the movie, was still able to do a good job. Idris Elba had the best development I should say.This story focuses more on plot development than character development, with the least character development given to its main character. The Kaijus have unique looks. None of them will remind you of Godzilla, however, there are some that will remind you of animals e.g. Shark, Frog, Bat Kaijus. The Jaegers, despite only a few being shown, were also cool. The CGI is pretty realistic and doesn't look like a Saturday Morning Cartoon at all.There are a few memorable quotes, those that we have already seen in the trailer. The plot is rather understandable and the action scenes are slow and steady, allowing you to see what is happening throughout, except for a few parts where they zoom in too much.If you are looking for a movie where you won't be emotionally-affected, and want to look for an action-packed movie with spectacular special effects and an interesting plot, look no further. This is it.","

Pacific Rim is a tribute to those old films. The effects are incredible, they don't look fake or phony CGI like your always seeing. But it does not only depend on the action and the effects, but the cast really bring a presence to this. It's over two hours but does not feel like it is, unlike The Lone Ranger. Pacific Rim is very well paced, never gets boring for a second.","

"brchthethird","14 November 2014","Guillermo del Toro brings his unique creative sensibilities to a genre that's been pushed into the ground, and while the results are entertaining and cool to watch it still has this ""been-there-done-that"" feel. For one, this level of destruction has been done before in all of the Transformers movies, and while it's more competently filmed here you can't escape the feeling that you've seen most of this stuff before. A few quibbles about this: no attention is paid whatsoever to collateral damage, but then again, that's a problem with the violence in most PG-13 movies. Also, the decision to film most of the action at night and around the ocean results in it being a little hard to follow due to the poor lighting and the fact that the robots and kaiju take up most of the screen because of their immense size. Moving on, I thought that the comedic relief in the form of two bickering scientists was well written and played, although it didn't really serve the story too much until the end. In fact, the story as a whole wasn't really spectacular, and was filled with a lot of clichÃ© moments and was very predictable. Despite all of these things, it was fun to watch and I had a good time. An entertaining, but ultimately forgettable, popcorn flick.","

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8 March 2019","When I first saw the trailer for this film, I became really excited. One of the staples of anime is the ""giant robot"" subgenre, of which Neon Genesis Evangelion and Gurren Lagann are certainly the classics. And while Pacific Rim (2013) wasn't an adaptation of an anime, it got my hopes up that it could be done well enough that we could see live action versions of these aforementioned anime. After all, adaptations to live-action from anything animated tend to be very difficult, so this would be a step in the right direction.I do have to say that this movie delivered what it promised. Something like a mix between Godzilla (1999) and Real Steel (2011), the premise was a little bit closer to Independence Day (1996) than I initially thought it would be. The visuals were stunning and the fight sequences were both immense and intense, never letting up with the action as the world's options for survival quickly dwindled down to practically nothing. So, the question of whether or not this could lead the way to other ""giant robot"" films still stands, but I think it did a good job of introduction. After all, the Mechanical Engineer in me really wants to see more ""giant robot"" films.Always the master of his visual craft, Guillermo del Toro delivered the same type of spectacle that we've come to expect from such films as Hellboy (2004) and Pan's Labyrinth (2006). Of course, the perk of Pacific Rim was a few of the ""lighter"" characters, like Ron Perlman's Hannibal Chau (which, given that this is a del Toro film, I practically expected Perlman to be in it) and Charlie Day's Dr. Newton Geiszler. I also felt that the multi-cultural element of this film was really well presented, along with its strong female sub-protagonist.A first giant step into potential future anime adaptations, I give Pacific Rim 4.0 stars out of 5.","

"maybakmusic","5 October 2013","I watched this because it looked badass; I'll be honest. First off, let me say that this movie has some of the best graphics and visuals of any film in history to date. The fight scenes in this, during 2013, are like when you watched Jurassic Park in the mid 90s. It's just so good, so amazing, on a godlike scale, that it gets at least an 8/10 fresh out the gate.The story is pretty cool, but the family angle is played at a little bit, so some cheesy stuff is in the mix (girl like boy, boy has a bully rival, boy fight rival for girl, boy get girl). But it actually is badass how the overall story is made somehow acceptable. It is like Avatar - super far fetched, but everything is logical and in order, so you completely buy it.Everything was amazing, you have to see it if you like any movies at all. Only reason I didn't give it a 10, was because the writing could perhaps have been a little better. There was a scene with a 5-10 minute hand to hand battle between a giant alien monster, and one of the human guided Voltrons. Blow for blow, it is like a Mike Tyson fight. And then literally, when Voltron is about to lose the fight, one of the Voltron pilots says something like ""Oh yea, we have this giant sword that can pop out of the arm"".... and it does, and they kill the alien with one swing... Things like that, are not necessary evils that blockbusters with simple plot lines must lug around - that's what they want us to think. Good writing can always tie a fictional story together.But you can get past that - and you will, because it still is so far beyond 99% of all movies ever made, that you will permanently see life differently after watching it.","

"garretsr","13 July 2013","This is a pretty bad movie. The acting is horrible but it is tough to tell because the movie is so poorly written. If it were just that the characters are as flat and predictable as a bad children's film then we could forgive it. I might even be able to forgive if there were just the major plot holes. However, they decided to break one of the cardinal rules of science fiction writing, which is ""be consistent."" To the extent that one can figure out the plot, there are huge problems with what is happening and why. The weapons and abilities of the robots and monsters seem to change based on the whim of the CGI animator. You have to wonder if anybody saw the entire movie script or plot line before the movie was complete.Finally, there are the pointless back story and side stories. When you're group is the only hope of stopping the end of the world, I'm pretty sure that nobody is going to put up with people who waste time on political infighting and alpha male dominance.","

Del Toro doesn't waste a lot of time trying to infuse PACIFIC RIM with the kind of boring, pointless melodrama that most such movies engage in: he gets down to business early on and rarely strays from the program. (The jab at Modern Man's world-destroying efforts is appreciated.) Moviegoers who've waited for a true Summer Blockbuster will walk away satisfied, though the hype surrounding this movie has been a tad on the RESERVED side, if you ask me: considering what we have here- the overall scale of EVERYTHING-, the trailers should've been Longer and even Louder. The fx actually ENHANCE the drama, the way fx always should (but rarely do). If you're a fan of Giant Monster movies or Giant Robot movies or Giant Monsters vs. Giant Robots movies, you're in luck: PACIFIC RIM is now playing.","

"RolloTomasi","27 July 2013","...it doesn't get better. I do like ""ID4"" but sci-fi writers looking for a plot keep stealing from it. They may not even realize they're doing it on a conscious level. I recently reviewed ""Oblivion"" which also borrows from ""ID4."" What I'm complaining about is this nuclear endgame that always pops up. It's become this deux ex machina that solves everything (and no, a nuclear reactor that melts down does not result in a nuclear explosion, as this film's homepage points out). Also, PR rips off the ""hive mind"" idea (and even calls it the same thing) from ID4. Remember the scene in ID4 where the president's mind is linked with the alien pilot's and he discovers their secret plan? Again, directly ripped off by Pacific Rim.But really, all this thievery's not a big deal as long as the story that surrounds it is sound. But PR is a mess. It never makes up its mind how seriously it wants to be taken. No character is interesting, or even very likable. At least ID4 had Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum odd couple to inject comedy into the proceedings, especially the ending. What's so unique (still) about ID4 is how the world comes together with existing technology (and old school strategies like morse code) to scrap with and beat the technologically advanced aliens. PR wants you to believe that in a few years we would have the technology to build these giant man-controlled robots operated through a mind-meld. What a mess.I will say that the fight scenes and CGI of Pacific Rim are commendable. That said, though, it's not enough. Filmmakers aren't even making films any more. they're making cartoons. This is a whole other subject but--there is a reason that these horror movies are coming along and burying the big-budget ""tentpole"" films studios parade out during the summer. The horror genre is still rooted in the basic elements of filmmaking: shot selection and editing. An audience wants to get emotionally involved. They're not impressed by computer-generated monsters any more. A film is story, camera angles, revelation, lighting, music, character, editing. Nothing's ever going to change that.","

I didn't get the chance to see this in cinema (where a movie like this really needs to be seen) yet I still enjoyed it, more so than Transformers 2 which I did on the big screen. Says a lot about how poor Bay's crapfest was and still is.","

"tradewinds68","20 July 2013","***DEFINITE SPOILERS***Although Pacific Rim has had mixed reactions from the critics and box office alike, it is clear to me on a lot of levels that very often, so- called critics only like art-house flicks and don't like to give positive reviews to mainstream movies, even of the caliber of Pacific Rim â it makes them look less intelligent, at least I'm sure that's what they think. I had mixed feelings about going to see the movie, and I can be just as critical as the critics, but I found very little to criticise either with the movie, special effects or the acting. It had a great plot, and the premise of the shared minds to harness the power of the Jaeger weaponry was a good concept and drove the storyline in a different direction to what might have been another alien shoot-em up movie. A few twists and turns here and there added to the enjoyment of the movie, along with subtle and non-so-subtle humour from the slightly mad scientists and Ron Perlman, whose appearance was an added bonus. Character-wise, I wasn't sure what to expect after seeing Charlie Hunnam in Sons of Anarchy, I couldn't quite visualise what he would be like as a hero. I was incredibly surprised and happy to find that I really enjoyed his performance as Raleigh Becket. The plot had several twists and turns in it and the special effects were amazingly seamless. Idris Elba portrayed his character very powerfully, his role softened slightly by his father-like relationship with rookie Jaeger pilot, Mako, played by Rinko Kikuchi, who is not generally known for mainstream movies. I give it a 9/10 and recommend ignoring the critics if you enjoy a rip- roaring humans vs aliens movie with a good plot, solid acting and great SFX (not to mention non-stop action).","

But if it is free on demand, then you can pay for it. This movie is an absolute waste of good film stock that the producers made in order to ""make their nut"".There is no plot, no character development, no story and no rhyme or reason to it. The character which the black actor, Ilba plays, commander or the flight squadron, comes across as a handicapped idiot. The main 2 characters,Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori, appear to be in high school the way they relate to each other. I wouldn't even think this movie would be good for a fourth grader to watch. After all most fourth graders liked Star Wars, a movie which this film is far, far below. Maybe a first grader could watch this movie and take some benefit out of it.","

"devadhodhan","15 August 2013","I have been following this movie for a while now. Largely because I thought it would be like the transformers franchise. Watched it in 3D(I have always strayed away from 3D before because I just didn't think it was worth spending the extra cash) but this time I do not regret my choice at all. It was a visual feast and you cant imagine a movie better than this for visual effects/dialogue delivery.Now the real highlight of the picture, the visuals are overall shiny and snazzy. The designs of the creatures and robots are palpably marvelous. As the special effects move these heavy giants, the action did something better than just blowing up stuff. Although explosions and loud noises are not actually flaws(It's about giant robots, c'mon!), but a real good set piece needs a decent and genuine fortitude. In the midst of the noises, you will always get the sense of danger to the Jaegers, mostly because there are human pilots beneath the ravaging machines. It effectively made those sequences electrifying and the monsters terrifying than you would expect.","

It is either love it or hate it. You can't say ""Wayul, it has some cool visuals so it has to be amazing"", or""Geeee, what a cool story""...because it isn't.This movie plays out very much like a slow moving video game. It has no catchy plot, only that some weird, huge monster characters invade the Earth from deep under the sea (Pacific to be exact...hence the title, wow is that creative or what), and a force of huge manned robot kinda machines, reminiscent of Transformers have been created to battle the threat. You really have to exercise your imagination to even understand the main plot let alone the whole story here. It just doesn't compare as an epic...I gave it a 5 for trying, nothing more...","

"guusebumps","11 July 2013","Only one word can describe Pacific Rim, and that is ""Wow!"". It got everything I need in a robot vs monster movie except one thing, which otherwise would make it a perfect movie.The movie got huge robots and huge monsters (that's obvious). It got great CGI, great robot vs monster fighting sequences, a surprisingly quite good story (which should be expected in a Guillermo del Toro movie, but which I didn't expect much at first in this kind of movie), rocket punch, Portal game's GlaDOS voice, and it even got (borrowing the term from Voltus V anime) the ""Tenkuu ken""! How awesome it is! But, as I said before, it is missing something. Something very important.== Warning: this part may contain spoiler ==Because Guillermo himself said that he wanted to ""honor"" the kaiju and mecha genres (while creating an original stand-alone film), and because he also said (in one of the promotional featurette videos) that he was influenced by Japanese big robot anime of his time like ""Tetsujin 28"", and also because one of the promotional posters featured a Japanese jaeger called ""Coyote Tango"", the absence of a Japanese jaeger really bothers me. I would give this movie a perfect ten stars if it shows even one sequence of a Japanese robot kicking a kaiju's ass, and not just featuring one Tokyo scene and two Japanese actresses. I personally think that Guillermo should at least give a nod to Japanese mecha anime genre. But no, Coyote Tango was not in the movie, so I take out two stars out of this movie.","

"ejackimowicz","25 August 2013","Okay, don't get me wrong. This movie was a thousand times better than any of the Transformers movies. I'll tell you why: the story was better, the effects were fantastic, and to be honest, the Gypsy Danger and Cherno Alpha truly made me feel small compared to Optimus Prime and Bumblebee.The tagline of the movie sold me: To fight monsters we created monsters. If you don't know anything about the movie, just learning the tagline gives you a general idea.What makes this film truly amazing to me is the fact that it was mesmerizing like other of my favorite visual effect movies like Zack Snyder's Man of Steel and James Cameron's Avatar. The acting was also great. The graced performances of Idris Elba (Golden Globe winner, Luther), Rinko Kikuchi (Oscar Best Supporting Actress, Babel), Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy), and Ron Perlman (Golden Globe winner, Beauty and the Beast) were seen as clever and entertaining.Some before even seeing the film might have said that this movie was all visuals and has no real plot, but they were proved wrong. The story was solid and creative. And yes, the big robotic machines were awesome, but the story was too. Now seeing this movie in IMAX 3D is the only way you can have fun at the theaters. Seeing it regularly at the movies isn't as ""magical"" as IMAX 3D is. Not only did the effects look great, but the sound was too. The heart-pounding stomp of the Jaeger's (German for ""hunter"", the gigantic robots created by the humans) monstrous feet treading through a destroyed city made you feel like you were standing right in front of it. The roar of the colossal Kaiju (Japanese for ""strange creature"", the monsters of the movie)coming out of the water made you tremble in fear. What else is there to say? This was one of the best times I've had at the movie theater since seeing Man of Steel. When this comes out on Blu-ray, I am buying it and putting it in my favorite films collection. Now if this movie isn't nominated for at least ONE Oscar, I will truly be disappointed with the Academy...","

I first saw this movie in my college's auditorium with a group of friends as part of Film Club (they wanted to show something fun during the midterm study break), and to be honest, this movie made me very happy. The action scenes and effects are delightfully colorful and violent, and most of the characters were surprisingly interesting and well-developed for a movie like this. Plus, there is something to be said for a film that portrays the Millennial Generation in a positive light for once.Even though it was written and directed by the same guy as Pan's Labyrinth, DO NOT expect anything profound to come out of Pacific Rim. It's a cheesy action movie, but one that manages to get the audience to look past that and enjoy it in all its over-the-top splendor.","

"Rockcomputers81","15 July 2013","My two cents. I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. It was somewhere middle of the road for me. The good: Set Design, The effects(The best I have ever seen), 3D, Idris Elba, Ron Perlman. The Bad: The Script, Bad Casting.Charlie Hunnam is great on SOA, but he is pretty much a one note actor. He has no charisma at all in the film and is boring to watch. Rinko Kikuchi while pretty to look at, comes across as a Asian stereotype. Her and Hunnam have no chemistry together at all. For two people that are suppose to be link they sure don't act like it at all. Charlie Day good god, I guess he was suppose to be the comic relief. But he comes off annoying and most of his scenes could have been cut and would have improved the film.To be honest I found it over long and just OK. Which is a shame because I love Del Toro and really wanted this to be a huge hit for him. I think It really comes down to casting, as bland as the script is some actors with chemistry and charisma would have gone along way it make it a lot more enjoyable.So there you have it.","

I won't go into detail regarding the plot, I would like to relate the feeling I had while watching this. Saw it in 2D and it was a spectacle in it's own accord. Giant behemoths dealing punches, superimposed over general population, produces a feeling of wonder and awe that, I'm sure, del Toro captured unerringly. Adrenaline powered speeches and last minute heroics really made me feel like child again. I had the whole cinema cheer and boo at the screen on various occasions, and the demographic was from 3 to 93 years of age. Feeling is similar to Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" through out. It's what ""Transformers"" and ""Godzilla"" SHOULD have been. No better way of spending your afternoon than this. Just go watch it...","

"Antagonisten","17 July 2014","I'm always somewhat like a kid on Christmas eve when it comes to Guillermo del Toros movies. I don't expect the world or an eye-opening life-changing experience, but I do expect to be entertained. He has a combination of visual flair, and understanding of how you build an effective action scene (and in extension action movie) which makes a potent cocktail.The plot is pure nonsense, and is rushed by mostly through voice-over right from the start. Seemingly just to get it out of the way. ""Bla bla, giant monsters attack and we build robots to meet them in a boxing-match."" Honestly, most of the plot is not explained much further in the film than in the trailer. Acting ranges between bland and pretty lame, some of the actors are competent performers, but it's not like they are especially challenged in this movie.So, with that out of the way, let's talk essentials. I'm not a fan of the monsters, they look clumsy and lack elegance. Generally though, this movie is beautiful. del Toro knows how to get the adrenaline flowing with visuals and a suitably high-octane soundtrack. Everyone talks tough, walks tough and acts tough. It doesn't always work, and parts of the story feel tacked-on and just an interruption to the action. But mostly though, the movie delivers when it comes to action and excitement.I view this as a guilty pleasure. Something that should appeal mostly to 13-year-olds, and not men three times their age. But still, even though I can't say that I feel like seeing it again, it entertained me for most of the duration.","

"azh-4","28 August 2013","Guillermo's sold his poor soul to the bleak, hope grinding Hollywood machine. And unfortunately he's taken Ron Perlman along for the ride. I saw the trailers; I was prepared to see a somewhat shallow sci-fi action flick with lots of monsters and robots. But this... This gargantuan, monstrously concocted mind numbing piece of celluloid refuse had me almost in tears of exasperation. The only reason I went to see this was the vain flicker of hope at seeing del Toro's name at the helm, having seen some of his early stuff - amongst others the beautifully eerie Devil's Backbone. How does a promising director with such a flair for suspense end up serving his used toilet paper to be projected on cinema screens? I would love to know. I couldn't understand half of what was being hollered at me through the deafening rain, overpowering tuba farts and gnarling metal. I couldn't see half of what was going on thanks to the constant night (is the lack of light a metaphor of the director's mind?) and the driving rain, both used to great effect to mask any failings in the CGI. Despite this, I could still predict every minute of this sad clichÃ© bonanza as it was unfolding. Watch the trailers, they're entertaining; you'll see everything worth seeing (the good CGI) and spare yourself the disappointing (lack of) story line and unfortunate acting. 2/10, and that's giving it an extra point for the detailed effects.","

The effects are perfect and the design of the Jaegers and Kaiju are creative and on par with previous Del Toro's visual feasts like Pan's Labyrinth.The characters are very likable with special mentions to the great performances of Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Hunnam.Rinko Kikuchi in particular is very talented as she makes her character adorable and bad-ass at the same time. Ron Perlman is perfect as Hannibal Chau.The fight scenes and accompanying music are adrenaline ridden and breathtaking. The scale of the battles between giants among a crumbling city is epic as it should be.And speaking of the soundtrack, it has one of the best music I've heard in recent years.A instant classic and a movie experience all movie lovers deserve to watch.Side note: I would throw all my money to watch a Pacific Rim x Godzilla Crossover.","

Spread that out on any old worn-out story. Now add excessive shaky-cam and pouring rain in every scene so nobody can focus on how terrible it really is.Fortunately I didn't care much about what I might be missing as it was simple-minded and predictable. I just wanted to get out of the theater and salvage what was left of my day.I yearn for a return to some truly excellent science fiction. This isn't it. We seem to be stuck in a rut where impractical machines with as many moving parts as you can possibly render aim to keep our minds distracted rather than engaged and immersed as science fiction should be.","

"roman-chlebec","29 July 2013","Easily my most favorite movie in last few years. It's like Batman Begins of ""big fighting robots"" movies. Beats Michael Bay's Transformers trilogy on many levels. Actually it beats most of the latest ""invasion"" sci-fi movies on many levels. The movement of the giant robots feels very real thanks to the excellent visualization and sound mixing. The main music theme *is* present every-time when it's needed to build that feeling of justification and awesomeness and it's epic presence is appreciated by the little boy in me watching the monumental scenes with eyes glued to the cinema canvas. It's *maybe* not taking itself very seriously, and characterization is quite flat, but the ""threat"" still feels more serious than in movies with similar themes. I couldn't get rid of the wide *cheshire cat grin* on my face when I was driving back home. It was *that* good. Thank you Guillermo del Toro.","

Now don't get me wrong i am a sucker for cheese, but this takes the biscuit, or more appropriately, the cracker. Every line by every actor is covered in it. I couldn't help but laugh and sometimes even cringe, but does that hinder my ability to sit back and enjoy the movie? Well, a little, yes. I just couldn't focus, and was unable to invest in the characters or the underlying story. If i was lactose intolerant i may have been in trouble.However the action scenes are riveting, you almost don't want them to stop. But as much as the film is a ""leave your brain at the door"" kind of film, i couldn't help but nitpick (which i hate myself for doing) at several of the scenes which i felt made no sense whatsoever. Misplaced analysing aside it is definitely worth seeing. A great action movie that doesn't take itself seriously. Remember though say CHEESE!!!!","

Guillermo del Toro is a marvellous director but here he has been tempted to let his imagination be kowtowed to convention - and really this is a 1980s film with 2010s special effects.Who buys that we will all have advanced so much in 5 years? That aside, Pacific Rim is simply frustrating - a cacophony of loud noise, big fights, pseudo-emotional scenes that leave us hoping the monsters win if it puts out of our misery. I cannot deny that the effects are stunning, nor that the overall effect left me stunned and not in a good way - this is not entertainment, it is boasting - and Del Toro was never Michael Bay - but here the boasting leaves no room for film.A huge shame.","

As great visuals demand more than a 51"" screen with built-in speakers to carry through on it's own, though, uninvolving acting and predictable plot just dragged overall viewing experience all down. My recommendation is therefore to watch ""Pacific Rim"" in the movie theater where the audio-visuals comes to their rights, and leaves you with the final impression. In any case: Leave your brains in the wardrobe... Del Toro had full control on both writing and directing ""El laberinto del fauno""(Pans Labyrinth), and made a masterpiece. Hopefully upcoming ""Pinocchio"" will pay tribute to his ability to make art when both writing and directing. Till then, ""Iron Man"" ticks all the right boxes, and leaves this rip-off in (and together with) Oblivion. CGI= 7 Contence= 2 Viewing experience on home TV= 3 Overall= 4","

I loved the relationship between the two, how deeply they connected and how their relationship developed. They don't over emphasize things in the movie, which I really liked. They give you just enough to be satisfactory and hint at the rest, they don't overwhelm you with certain aspects of the movie. This movie isn't mind blowing, life changing, or touches your heart and pulls at its strings, but overall it was enjoyable and entertaining.

"MBunge","13 July 2013","The greatness of Guillermo del Toro as a filmmaker is his ability to tap into the pure imagination of childhood. The failing of del Toro as a storyteller is that he's not grown up enough to discipline that imagination. He embraces fantastic ideas and marvelous imagery but, left to his own devices, his films falter on simplistic and underdeveloped characters, boring and meandering plots, clichÃ©s piled on top of clichÃ©s and an unwillingness to get everything to make sense. Like a child, del Toro doesn't notice if he's being repetitive or nonsensical or erratic or if his story isn't going anywhere.Pacific Rim is probably the best looking giant robot vs. giant monster movie ever made. The special effects and fight scenes are remarkable to watch. Outside of those scenes, this film isn't any better and might be a bit worse than the average man-in-suit Godzilla flick from Toho. Frankly, the prologue where del Toro world-builds the setting of this motion picture is more interesting and more dramatically compelling than everything that follows.After years of Mankind using giant robots to kill giant monsters coming out of a dimensional rift on the ocean floor, a fallen hero is resurrected to help in a final attempt to end the war. A bunch of stockier-than-stock characters are introduced. There's a tired subplot with one of the guys from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. Big battles ensue. The good guys win. Granted, most folks are looking for stuff like Pacific Rim to be a combination of Mamet, Shakespeare and Steinbeck, but there's not a moment of alleged drama or comedy here you haven't seen many, many, many times before.But del Toro can't even manage his clichÃ©s right. He spectacularly introduces his main hero, played by Charlie Hunnam, and sets up the character's personal challenge. Then del Toro relegates his hero to bystander while he elevates a series of secondary characters to the fore. That might have been bold if their stories were at all entertaining or original. Those secondary character arcs, however, are arbitrarily manufactured, introduced and mostly left unresolved. This could have been Hunnam's big shot at movie stardom. Instead, you'll barely remember he was in the movie.By the standards of summer blockbusters, Pacific Rim is unexceptional but okay. Maybe if it bombs, folks will stop letting del Toro run wild and force him to marry his amazing vision to some cold, hard, practical thought.","

And they build massive war machines that are driven by people to fight these gargantuan reptilian invaders.That was basically the entire storyline, and for some reason director Guillermo del Toro needed 131 minutes to tell a story that could have been told in one-third of the spent time.Right from the very beginning, you know the exact outcome of the movie, and there isn't a single surprise throughout the entire movie, which was sort of too much in a singular easy to be one step in front of the movie at all times. This was what the movie suffered from. Well, that and the appalling fact that the movie was a very weak excuse of a storyline.Which leads me on to the characters. The characters in the movie were actually more like caricatures than actual characters. They were wooden and had really awkward and often bad dialogue to work with. And the people behind these caricatures were doing alright jobs given the nature of the movie, but I can't really say that there was any one performance that stood out as being overly memorable compared to the others in the movie.That being said, then I will say that the CGI special effects in ""Pacific Rim"" is off the charts, and it looks nothing short of spectacular. The creatures were very realistic and moved about in a very believable way. Although they were a bit on the simplistic side in terms of creativity in the creature design. The war machines were nice as well, although I think the whole part about them needing two pilots to work in symbiosis was a little bit stupid.If you are looking for a Sci-Fi movie that requires absolutely nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, from your brain, then ""Pacific Rim"" is a great way to spend 131 minutes in dazzling special effects, CGI galore and fluorescent neon lighting.I am rating ""Pacific Rim"" a 6 out of 10 stars, purely because of the CGI effects that is dazzling and a real treat for the eyes. This is indeed a movie suitable for a day where you are nurturing a hangover, feeling sick, or just need to lay on the couch with your brain sent away on holiday. ""Pacific Rim"" is a guy's movie all the way through...","

"jr73340","23 July 2013","Pacific Rim was very entertaining and it actually kept my attention for the whole two hours - something very few modern movies have been able to do. By the end of the movie, I ACTUALLY cared about what happens to the characters and how the story was going to resolve itself (despite the fairly standard-predictable-ending).When I first saw the trailer for Pacific Rim, I was sure it was going to be another brainless-CGI-bonanza that has NO character development, NO coherent plot, NO good actors and NO chemistry between those actors. You know what I'm talking about. I was expecting another ""Transformers 2"", ""Battleship"" or ""Total Recall"". I was wrong.I am by no means saying that Pacific Rim is Oscar material; but at least the director - together with the script writers and the actors - were able to produce some witty and compelling scenes that got me emotionally involved with the characters. That's very rare today.But there is something else that I want to compliment the director on:1) This movie had no political agenda that I could detect. There were no unnecessary snipes at Christianity, there was no promotion of ""alternative lifestyles"", and there was no criticism of capitalism or the military (aka the typical Hollywood targets). Well done.2) There was no nudity and no gratuitous sex scenes, even though there was a strong romantic relationship between the two main characters. In other words, there was no sexual propaganda in this movie. Well Done.3)There was very little use (if any) of the F-word in this movie. The characters were able to express their ""toughness"" and determination without resorting to childish profanity. Well Done.8/10","

"kermitkid","30 March 2020","What happens when you mix Transformers, Avatar and Godzilla? You get Pacific Rim. If you were disappointed by Transformers, this will replace it in your heart. It's everything Transformers should have been. Michael Bay, if you're reading this, have the director of this help you with Transformers 4. You absolutely must see this on the big screen. Don't wait for the DVD/Bluray. It's a BIG movie that absolutely positively MUST be seen in the theater. It's got action, explosions, wit, and is definitely the best movie of summer 2013. My only complaint is it ran a little too long. They could have cut a half hour. Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars.","

"jrkaraoka00","21 July 2013","Took a chance on this actually stupid movie whereby you would have to be stupid to believe any of it.The premise that if you build a giant robot to fight a giant monster and then punch the monster like it was a title bout is ridiculous, and an insult to your mind set. why spend billions to build these robots only to fire cannons at them from close range. the thought that you would power this giant robot with the thoughts of two separates minds is staggering.I found it to not be worth a tenth of the money spent to see the hype. I would call it ""Godzilla vs Transformers "" for a Saturday morning kid show . but to cough up $50.00 for 2 adults and 2 kids to see this movie,is just not worth it.My opinion was not the only, my wife and kids hated it too.","

"Ar_Pharazon_the_golden","19 September 2014","I enjoyed Pacific Rim. It was all very good fun to watch with friends. But that doesn't make it a good film, does it? Let's start with an example from the start of the movie: These humongous monsters start destroying the world, then, in a matter of a few months, humans develop enormous super robots to fight back. These are initially successful, but eventually the monsters become stronger and regain the upper hand. So, time for a change of strategy! Instead of fighting back with our Voltron-like super robots that probably cost all the world's resources, we are moving to plan B: build a ridiculously tall coastal wall, which apparently is meant to cover the entirety of land adjacent to the Pacific Ocean.This is the amount of thought that went into Pacific Rim. A film where every turn of the plot (well, the ""plot"") can be foreseen, where the non-Americans are (very) expendable, and the Kaijus stay behind to guard a gate that cannot be breached unless they themselves pass through it - so let's just stay here in case the humans figure it out and want to come along. A film of course where the heroes are extremely happy to protect humanity by demolishing entire cities and probably killing millions in the process - but hey, if a robot and a monster fighting ten meters away from a fishing boat doesn't cause it any damage, maybe all is well.Certainly, the more ridiculous it gets, the more fun it is. There is a certain pleasure in seeing a creature weighing 2000 tonnes (?) grabbing an equally large robot and then spreading its leather wings and taking flight. TO SPACE. Wherefrom the robot falls. In a stadium. And isn't damaged. At all. The clichÃ©s parade one after another, turning Pentecost into a sort of a cult character and the entire movie into an amusing ride, which couldn't however really be considered cinema. And for which I refuse to believe Del Toro couldn't have tried a little bit harder. On the plus side, the fight scenes are good (not chaotic with a camera spinning crazily for no reason or something)","

"darkguile86","15 July 2013","In one line: the monster from Cloverfield meets a dumbed down Sons of Anarchy.The point of this movie is solely a way to show the action scenes, the rest is just pointless and aggravating filler. Tired clichÃ©s and one liners make up the majority of the dialog, I found it incredibly aggravating. The acting was simply terrible, bar Ron Perlman whom always fits his roles well. Whilst Charlie Hunman's typecast acting style fits SoA, it doesn't make well on the big screen. He overacts in an aggressive manner to compensate for his lack of all other emotions. It's just a bit too boring and reminds me of the kind of acting you get on TV dramas - look hard and sound always annoyed.The action scenes were OK, nothing I hadn't seen before in Transformers, although the city destruction scenes were pretty amazing. If the director hadn't gone down the route of cheese and action clichÃ©, but instead taken his job seriously this could have been a semi decent film. If you like giant robots, Japanese style monsters, and are 12 years old or younger go see this movie, (chances are you will still hate it).","

"jeffpk","20 July 2013","Pacific Rim is a live action mashup of giant robot anime and classic rubber-suit kaiju movies (eg Godzilla).Being a Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy) movie, it has a strong, bold and lavish sense of visual style. It is clear that Del Toro both knows and loves both of the movie traditions he is drawing on but also suffuses the movie with a Hollywood sensibility, all without an obvious clash or discord.The plot is not deep, in fact as anime it would be on the markedly shallow side. There is none of the philosophical musings or mythological literacy that underlies good anime. It is, in the end, about as deep as a Godzilla film. The characters are shallowly drawn with obvious motivations. The plot is pretty minimal with most of the movie being spent on action sequences.In the end, my review is much like my review of Avatar. Its a B action movie. But what a B action movie!I saw it in IMAX 3D and, if you can, its definitely worth the extra few bucks. The movie is visually stunning, exciting in its action sequences, and in the end just a whole lot of fun for anyone else who loves the source genres.Which certainly includes me.","

"drjgardner","13 July 2013","The problem with special effects films is that the special effects tend to dominate the story and the character development, but at the end of the day, it is story and character which make a film memorable. ""Pacific Rim"" is a classic case â great special effects overshadow a poorly developed story line and even weaker characters. One of the core problems in the film is that the main actor, Charlie Hunnam, who does such a great job on the TV series ""Sons of Anarchy"", just doesn't translate well to the big screen. It's not an uncommon problem (think David Caruso). His co-star, Rinko Kikuchi, seems completely lost, and most of the other characters don't have enough screen time for us to care one way or the other. Idris Elba, who usually turns in a good performance, can barely be understood, and Max Martini (""The Unit"", ""Redbelt""), another fine actor, seems to be sleepwalking.The comic relief, provided by Charlie Day, Ron Perlman, and Burn Gorman, are more ludicrous than funny.OTOH, the film does have some really impressive special effects, except for the ending, which appears to be shot in the pool of Director Guillermo del Toro. Del Toro directed the ""Hell boy"" (2004, 2008) films, which probably accounts for Ron Perlman's brief cameo. His best work has been ""Pam's Labyrinth"" (2006) which wasn't exactly an action adventure film, and his penchant for sci-fi and insect-like creatures can be seen as far back as ""Mimic"" (1997) which isn't remembered as a classic. Nonetheless he does a good job with the special effect sequences and they will keep you on the edge of the seat.","

"dioditto","23 July 2013","Just went and saw the movie this afternoon, and even though I had a very low expectation, the movie still surprised me with its corny acting, pretentious and unrealistic plot, and largely WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) inspired action sequence.If you are age 8 and below, you will invariably enjoy this. This movie is designed from the outset for the 8 year olds. The plot is superficial and kept to the minimum - giant robots battles giant monsters, and that's pretty much it, even though it is pretty illogical and doesn't take a 9 year olds to see why you would need giant robots at all to battle these monsters - it would be far more economical to just build 1000 cannons that fires exactly the same type of projectiles the giant robots used to defeat the monsters.The acting was also pretty cringe worthy, truly some spectacular C-grade stuff, with Max Martini and Robert and Kazinsky pretending to be Australians with their laughable faux Australian accent. Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi were decent, but the plot made their efforts seem cartoonish, while Idris Elba's acting was just down right corny; with Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as sideshows to round out the cast. Cartoonish acting aside, this movie continues the same disturbing Hollywood tradition of racial stereotypes - the Chinese and the Russians were dispensable and dispatched quickly early in the movie, while ""the token black guy"" Idris Elba (the ONLY black guy in the movie) was also dispensable and died in the movie.There is also a very clear plagiarism happening throughout the movie - ""aliens"" attacked the earth, humanity is on the verge of extinction, nerdy scientist got in alien's brain and figured out how to defeat them, and the movie ends with the good guy (and a gal) ""took out the little master aliens with the nuke"".... sounds familiar? You would mistaken this for Independence Day (1996).Over all, it is as entertaining as watching WWE on TV. You would enjoy it if you are an 8 year old or a redneck (or both!). 3/10","

"craig-priddle-741-920264","28 July 2013","I saw this with a couple of 12 year olds and they were apparently as bored as I was. Given the hyper story line and massive protagonists, you would think there would be some excitement. Think away, just imagine it and don't bother seeing the movie because the editing makes the action almost incomprehensible. That big thing hit that other big thing and oh my, the big thing there is going to come around fast....there you go, battle sequences described in almost as much detail as you see.Central characters you don't really care about, cardboard cutout scientists and two of the worst Australian accents in recent cinematic history also didn't make it very engaging. I mean really? No Australian actor could do the job botched up by those on screen? I don't believe it for one second.So, dull as dishwater, big and loud, not engaging for 12 year olds and those with a significant amount of years under their belt... not much more to say, except perhaps to say, again, save your money and don't bother.","

"ben-675-453257","23 August 2013","I wasn't quite sure what to expect after watching the trailer for pacific rim. Was this another transformers? Godzilla MK2? Well, it was actually a pleasant surprise in many many ways.Narrative: Nothing to fault here. The story line is solid and cuts strait to what's important instead of burying us in years of back-story and needless contextual rubbish. Its a pretty strait forward affair with not may surprises it must be said, but the beauty really does lie in the simplicity with which the story is both crafted and told.Effects: This is my only gripe. I predominately wanted to see this film for the effects, and don't get me wrong they are utterly beautiful at times, but stylistically, its like someone has taken cyberpunk, steam punk, a little bit of blade runner, star wars and some minority report, scattered all that on a table and picked little bits blindfolded to recycle. There are moments of utter utter genius in the concept design that I think we will see cropping up in many a sci-fi from now on, but as a whole, it has no governing style which visually, i found both confusing and a little annoying...Cast and characters: Not much to say here really. There's not going to be any Oscar nominations but neither are there any terrible scenes. At times some of the main characters feel a little wooden and under-developed, but in a film predominately based on action, its not a huge issue and anything it lacks it soon makes up for elsewhere.Conclusion: Its worth your money at the cinema, and judging by the press not many have been parting with hard earned cash to see this, which is a real shame. This film has some real intelligence to it which I think earns it a viewing and better press. Imagine everything you hated about transformers, well this is an antidote. From start to finish it is very entertaining and deals with a disaster scenario in a very refreshing manner. If you going to watch anything besides Elysium, I would suggest this. I've given it seven stars, but if this turns out to be the classic it very well could be, I'd imagine most will be giving it 8.","

"sharcs","7 November 2013","I approached this movie expecting to see lots of action and out of this world special effects and that is exactly what I got. The movie keeps you at the edge of your seat from start to finish and it does away with boring sub plot lines that have become the norm. If you're looking for a love story or a deep thought provoking movie, you will not find it here, this is a fun, save the world, kick-ass action packed flick and it does that very well.I really don't understand why other reviewers are giving it low scores for doing exactly what it set ouu to do. You don't go to watch a love story and complain that there isn't enough action, so why do you go and watch a ""robots Vs monsters"" movie and complain that the plot lacked complexity? If you want to watch a good action flick that delivers pure adrenaline fuelled mayhem minus that mushy crap that they seem to be putting in movies all the time, then you'll love this. Want something else, find that and watch that.","

"rbmaclachlan","14 July 2013","Saw this movie yesterday and came away with a feeling that finally a movie like this has been made in the right way because this movie was inspired by the anime mecca movies and cartoons and I think that Del toro did his research very well as he always does in bringing this type of movie to life. I think one of the things that struck me about this movie deeply was the fact the robots was controlled by humans which to me gave the robots purpose and drive you feel for the robots because they are manned by humans there was never a point were during the movie the action lacked because as i said before Del toro thought very carefully about what he wanted to show in regards to action story and detail to me he is a director who takes great pride in what he does and he wants it done in the right way and I respect that greatly. I would just like to say to all the people who are comparing it to transformers that is fine and your opinion but they are only similar because they are giant robots and that is it in my opinion Michael Bay needs to take notes respect his craft because he from what he has given with transformers has really make it look very all money no heart and that is not what it is about.","

"ViktorDrake","17 July 2013","Simply put - I loved every minute of it! I have a wide appreciation for all genres of movie, and what I love more than anything is a movie that does exactly what it says on the tin.... and this movies does that in spades!I recently read a review from someone who gave Pacific Rim 1 out of 10, and said something along the lines of, ""I like mature films, so this is terrible"". Yes, well, one look at the trailer should've been more than sufficient to let that particular reviewer know what they were going to see. Yes it's loud. Yes it's big, brash and at times a little brainless, and has more that it's fair share of clichÃ©s (although I prefer to call them homages!) but that's what this kind of movie is all about.That said, I would say there is a little more brain and emotion in this movie than in other films of this type, and all the better it is too as a result. Sure there are plenty of elements from other movies all present and correct. There's a bit of Independence Day, a bit of Transformers, and bit of Top Gun, a bit of the Matrix, even a bit of Inception, but frankly who cares? This movie has NEVER set out to be anything more than it is - a full on crazy action movie about huge mechanical exoskeletons fighting huge alien monsters. Not every movie needs multiple layers of complexity to be considered as good.The CGI and practical effects are some of the best I've ever seen in any movie, the casting is absolutely fine in my opinion, and the script is perfectly adequate for this type of film.It's very easy to pick holes in movies like this, such as saying, ""why don't they just fire missiles at the Kaiju instead of fighting them hand to hand"", etc, but that would kind of defeat the whole purpose of the film, and at the end of the day, going to the movies is all about suspending disbelief for a couple of hours of your life. I think too many people have forgotten how to simply enjoy a film at face value without feeling the need to criticise something.That said, the only thing I felt that was slightly incongruous was the comedic scientist duo. I did find them quite amusing, but when they appeared for a scene they just didn't seem to sit all that well with the incredible action sequences involving the Jaeger's and Kaiju. But that's the only slight negative point I can think of. (One star off for this point).If this movie had been made when I was 15 it'd instantly be my favourite film of all time. As it is, and with me with an extra 20+ years on my age, it still ranks as a truly great film OF IT'S KIND, in my book. Of course it's not the Godfather, it's not Citizen Kane, it's not Schindler's List, but what it IS is a master class in how to do the ""big boys toys"" action genre.See it in IMAX (as I did) and simply revel in the rib-rumbling noise and eye-popping action. For what it is, it's very VERY hard to beat.","

The way the action is choreographed is best even if its a robot fighting- The fights seems like more Human to a Monster and it was Stylish. Movie rating as per my thoughts is perfectly 8.5/10. The Storyline that makes the Human world to be almost responding to a catastrophe even though its strange from normal-the Movie is perfectly scripted. Sometimes have felt that instead of creating this as a sequel let this Movie remain as a legend or evergreen movie of all time and it perfectly deserves i guess.","

"thebrickbear","31 July 2013","Great movie!Many directors these days fail to make a good Kaiju movie. I gotta say, this is one of the best. This movie makes me wanna keep watching it again and again, it is truly... epic. Just a quick Pros n' Cons (without spoiler)Pros: 1)CGI & FX: Fantastic interpretation of both the Kaiju and Jaeger. Visual effects demonstrate an excellent example of what an action film should look like. Plus, VFX were used very conservatively unlike many of the recent action films when all you see is explosions explosions fire explosions. 2)Plot n' Story: Very well written. Though, it might be somewhat predictable for many of you movie-goers. The fact that both the antagonist (Kaiju) and protagonist (You know, citizens from earth) are well-balanced. Both sides were quite ""badass"" and did not feel like one was dominating over the other.It was never about being all emotional, but it had a sense of taking a last stand. 3)(Most)Characters: Each character was unique in some way, and each had a story you could expand on. Guillermo Del Toro had thought outside the box in portraying them, and it seemed fresh. 4)Idea: We haven't had a decent Kaiju movie in a while. The movie successfully redefines and sets a new standard for a Kaiju movie. The idea was really fresh. Believe me, I once thought ""Pacific Rim"" was a joke at first, but then it actually made some sense.Now, for the Cons.. Only one con for me: 1) Charlie Day had to be the most ANNOYING character I had ever seen. I mean...the way he talks is just so arrogant and loud. Every time he speak it sounds so high pitched and hyper. His tone was so angry and impatient. He doesn't have that ""Chris Tucker"" element and he was not funny at all, just plain annoying. The scientific sidekick also seemed like he was on drugs. Same tone. And moreover, it stands out so badly.Boo for that.Besides that, the movie was great, certainty recommend you guys to check it out... in 3D.",NA

This movie will seriously go through every lame clichÃ© from the 90s.Movies like this insult the viewers intelligence, I don't know why this crap doesn't go straight to video, isn't there a committee of any kind that establishes quality?The rating on IMDb is unbelievably high so I'm guessing they actually went ahead and bought good reviews and ratings. IMDb is slowly but surely becoming untrustworthy because of things like this, it's honestly sad that you can't even rely on them to have a clear depiction of the quality of things.",NA
"mattparma","25 August 2013","As an avid movie fan, this film had one of the best visual effects on the big screen I've seen in a while. Although I knew most of the technology did not exist, it looked so realistic. I'm in no way a professional, so take this with a grain of salt, but it seemed to me that the visual fx department did wonders with the context and they were top notch (applauds).That said, I had two problems with this movie: acting and story.I have to say, acting was really sub-par and it didn't really make me want to see any other work of the actors/actresses involved. (Except Ron Perlman :-) ) And I'm sorry to say this, but Dr. Geiszler's voice was beyond annoying. I haven't seen Charlie Day in any other production and I'm planning to watch ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" sometime in the future, so I'll try to keep an open mind and won't judge him based on that.The story started out promising and during most of the movie, I wasn't really interested in the details anyway as I was mesmerised by the action and visuals. However, I would have appreciated it, if when the science behind was being explained, it made more sense. And the ending... I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so suffice it to say, I was dissatisfied.All in all, if you like sci-fi, action and special effects, this is one of the good ones. 7/10 from me.",NA

"vansheelakre","29 December 2013","First I will say this. Guillermo Del Toro is one of my top 5 movie directors. I own Blade 2, Hellboy 1 and 2, Pans Labyrinth, The orphanage and so on. I was really looking forward to this movie for over a year and was wishing it would deliver but all it did was fail. EPICALLY. The score I gave were for visuals. Whoever says this movie is great they are the reason movies keep getting made. I left the movie theater angry. This has to be the worst movie written and edited of all time. How would anyone release this $200 million dollar cluster fudge.Writing is the key to success. The plot of the movie is that a crack opens that port's monsters from another dimension to our world. So its one crack. So answer this why didn't they try to nuke the thing from the beginning to see if it fails before creating the jaegars and finding out at the end that nuking it will fail. Then after creating the Jaegars which were like 30 of them. Why not have them on standby near the stupid crack. The reason being its proved that only one appears at a time. They track them as they appear. Correct. Imagine how much repair they will save if all 30 ganged this one Kaiju as he was entering our world. Why the hell would you split up the Jaegars around the world if its only one crack. Even if they decide to send 10 kaijus they will still fail. But now they decide to do this strategy when only 4 Jaegers are left.Next when driving the Jaegers why is there a spinning blade grinder under these guys? What happens if the accidentally fall in? Wait that actually almost happened. Bad design don't you think. Next we have the guy mind meld with a kaiju brain. Now why would they do this. Oh because once the 2 kaijus defeat the 3 Jaegars in less than a minute of movie time they need a diversion for one of the kaijus to leave. Why didn't both Kaijus leave after the scientist guy? So that Dipsey Stranger can intervene and take them out separately. Then something stupid happens. The Gorilla kaiju that's left over doesn't destroy the last non functioning Jaegar. He just walks around it and punches it in the head. Then these 2 guys get out and blind him with a flare. Seriously.Now we get to the kaijus defeat. Why is the Kaiju pregnant? Its proved that they are all clones. WHY? Thats easy to fix the plot hole in the scientist guy to mind meld with the baby kaiju who has no recollection of whats going on in the other dimension. WTF. Really? The thing is in an egg and it has memories. Its like saying that if a woman is pregnant and the baby is delivered I can mind meld with it and it can show me where he came from heaven or HELL. ""Because this is what this movie is"".Finally the part that I screamed at in the Theater. If you read this you know it was me. What was the purpose of having a stick fight training scene if the damn robots cannot use weapons? I didn't see them us any hand-held weapons in which this would benefit them. Oh wait the sword at the end against the flying Kaiju. This is where I screamed, ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME"". They had this weapon the whole time and never used it. WHY? Oh that's right. If they used it in the beginning the brother wouldn't die and the other brother would not meet the Japanese girl in which they wind up have a interracial love interest. THAT DOESN'T WORK. USE THE SWORD. Then later on create kaijus that are smarter in disabling this technique.OK forget the sword. how about this. How many times did the jaegers had these kaijus by the neck and never once bothered to crush it with the robotic power? I lost count. As for the flying sucker hell my hands were free. Why not crush its neck with my bare robotic hands.Then the movie finally ends just like independence day with the stupid alien looking at the Jaeger exploding this movie.",NA
"newtonpost","14 July 2013","This is a B movie with a massive CGI budget.The characters are 2 dimensional and the plot is predictable. I kept myself amused spotting the plot holes and inconsistencies. How come you need a monster to use the lift of the way down, but not on the way back? A giant robot falling from a few thousand feet could possibly survive, the people inside - no. Heavily reinforced metal body armour might help you survive in a robot/monster battle, but will drown you the moment you try and swim in it. The robot pilots move their legs at one speed, the robot legs move at another, although the arms were more closely synchronised. I could go on. And on. And on.The action sequences are over the top and very repetitive and the dialogue is embarrassingly gung-ho.I really went wanting to enjoy this. I am also a huge fan of Idris Elba. I hope they paid him a lot for his time. Me, I wasted 131 minutes of my life.Bring back the chap in the rubber Godzilla suit.",NA
"Raptor-the-amazing","15 January 2014","Look, this film was pretty stupid. The plot was pretty unrealistic, Mako would switch from English to Japaniese mid-sentence. The main guy struggled to maintain his Americian accent. They for get the have a GIANT SWORD UNTIL TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE! But none of that matters. This film was OUTSTANDING.Everyone turned in a magnificent showing for the acting, everyone had depth, personality and back story so we could care for them! The story was great. I mean c'mon! Aliens coming from space and robots having to fight them? Haven't seen that! (Unless you count District 9 or every single Japaniese Anime ever made...) But aliens from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and two-person mechs fighting them? THAT IS ORIGINAL. The music was great, outstanding effects (also the effects team who worked on this are working on the new 'Godzilla' coming this May!) and spot-on humour when it's needed! So can i recommend 'Pacific Rim'? YESYESYES!!! Go watch this, It is SO worth your time, watch it with friends and it will be even better! This is an AMAZING MOVIE. And I can't wait for a sequel!",NA
"Hellmant","13 July 2013","'PACIFIC RIM': FIVE STARS (OUT OF FIVE)Director Guillermo del Toro's sci-fi action film about a future where the world is taken over by giant sea creatures and humanity's last hope is to build giant robots to fight them. The robots are controlled by two pilots who must merge their minds together through a neural link in order to control them. Del Toro uses this theme as a metaphor for how we all must come together in life (accepting each other's flaws and differences and utilizing each other's strengths and empathy) in order to survive and live in peace and happiness. The movie is corny for sure but it's an awesome kids movie with a lot of heart and fanboys should be more than pleased. The story is set in the near future when a portal is opened, in a crevasse beneath the Pacific Ocean, which leads to another dimension. It unleashes giant monsters into our world, called 'Kaiju', which quickly wipe out millions of lives and destroy much of our resources. All the countries of the world unite together to fight the monsters and develop a technology they call 'Jaegers', which are giant humanoid robots controlled by two pilots. The pilots must link to the robots, through a neural bridge, in order to control them. This proved to be too much for a single pilot so two pilots are required to control the robots and must neurally link together, through a process called 'Drifting', in order to do so. 'Drifting' allows the pilots to see into each others minds, and learn the other's deepest and darkest fears, in order to better cooperate and control the giant machinery. The film focuses on one pilot, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who loses his brother (Diego Klattenhoff) while 'drifting' (during a 'Jaeger' battle with an extremely powerful 'Kaiju'). The trauma of the event forces him to retire and the world continues to decay as the 'Jaegers' become less and less effective in battling the 'Kaiju'. The worlds governments eventually give up on the 'Jaeger' program and terminate it. The 'Jaeger' program's commanding officer, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), isn't ready to quit just yet. He comes up with a plan to end the war with the monsters once and for all but he needs Becket to help him carry it out. Becket reluctantly agrees and teams up with a test pilot, named Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), to pilot his old 'Jaeger' (which is named 'Gipsy Danger' and one of only four remaining 'Jaegers'). Mako is very close to Pentecost and has a tragic past involving the 'Kaiju', which causes complications when 'drifting' with Becket. The two must overcome these problems and work together as the 'Kaiju' become an increasingly greater threat. A geek scientist, named Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day, of 'IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA' fame) also becomes intricate in Becket's plan to stop the apocalypse.Del Toro directed and co-wrote the film (with Travis Beacham, who conceived the story idea). Together they really have created an amazing world. I love all the detail and passion that went into creating it and think it really paid off well. Their $180 million budget really went to good use as the film looks spectacular. It's like a beautiful live action cartoon and you really can't go wrong with giant robots vs. monsters (the action scenes are unreal)! It's everything I loved about the movies when I was a kid (this movie would have blown me away). The acting is great (Elba is always too cool, Kikuchi gives a passionate and very strong performance and I could watch Day for hours in a role like this) but the star of this movie really is Guillermo del Toro. He's really outdone himself here. I love movies but I especially like the nostalgic ones that really bring out the kid in me. This is one of those movies and I can't give it high enough praise.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P84p-Ba6JbY",NA
"markdocterman","11 August 2013","I was hopeful going in from a review I read but it could have gone bad. Instead it went great. You know that the humans win - of course. Instead of making up some twisted plot you get interesting side stories, some surprise, good acting, good fights and an attempt at realism. The scientists were good for comedy without being annoying. I only recognized one actor so I saw some new people who were great, like Elba and Kikuchi. A part of the opening is how so many countries worked together but there is no message that would serve no purpose but would be heavy-handed.I didn't see any of the Transformers movies; I will make a comparison to Independence Day.",NA
