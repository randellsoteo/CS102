"1","Effect of temperature and copper doping on the heterogeneous Fenton-like activity of Cu$_x$Fe$_{3-x}$O$_4$ nanoparticles","Nahuel Nuñez, Enio Lima Jr., Marcelo Vásquez Mansilla, Gerardo F. Goya, Álvaro Gallo-Cordova, María del Puerto Morales, Elin L. Winkler","Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)","Ferrite nanoparticles serve as potent heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) for decomposing organic pollutants. We investigated the impact of temperature and copper content on the catalytic activity of nanoparticles with different oxidation states of iron. Via solvothermal synthesis, we fabricated copper-doped magnetite (Cu$_x$Fe$_{3-x}$O$_4$) with a Fe$^{2+}$/Fe ratio ~0.33 for the undoped system. Using a microwave-assisted method, we produced copper-doped oxidized ferrites, yielding a Fe$^{2+}$/Fe ratio of ~0.11 for the undoped nanoparticles. The ROS generated by the catalyst were identified and quantified by electron paramagnetic resonance, while optical spectroscopy allowed us to evaluate its effectiveness for the degradation of a model organic dye. At room temperature, the magnetite nanoparticles exhibited the most $\cdot$OH radical production and achieved almost 90% dye discoloration in 2 hours. This efficiency decreased with increasing Cu concentration, concurrently with a decrease in $\cdot$OH generation. Conversely, above room temperature, Cu-doped nanoparticles significantly enhance the dye degradation, reaching 100% discoloration at 90$^\circ$C. This enhancement is accompanied by a systematic increase in the kinetic constants, obtained from reaction equations, with Cu doping. This study highlights the superior stability and high-temperature catalytic advantages of copper ferrite holding promise for enhancing the performance of nanocatalysts for decomposing organic contaminants.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:19:10 UTC (2,447 KB)"
"2","High-resolution spectroscopic analysis of four unevolved barium stars","M. P. Roriz, N. Holanda, L. V. da Conceição, S. Junqueira, N. A. Drake, A. Sonally, C. B. Pereira","Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)","A classical Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium analysis, based on high-resolution spectroscopic data, is performed for a sample of three potential barium dwarf candidates and one star already recognized as such. We derived their atmospheric parameters, estimated their masses and luminosities, and determined chemical abundances for a set of 21 elements, including CNO. Some elemental abundances are derived for the first time in HD~15096, HD~37792, and HD~141804. The program stars are dwarfs/subgiants with metallicities typical of disc stars, exhibiting moderate carbon enhancements, with $\rm{[C/Fe]}$ ratios ranging from $+0.29$ to $+0.66$ dex, and high levels of \textit{slow} neutron-capture ($s$-process) elements, with $\rm{[\textit{s}/Fe]}\gtrsim +1.0$~dex. As spectroscopic binaries, their peculiarities are attributable to mass transfer events. The observed neutron-capture patterns of were individually compared with two sets of $s$-process nucleosynthesis models (Monash and {\sc fruity}), yielding dilution factors and masses estimates for the former polluting Asymptotic Giant Branch stars. Low-mass ($\lesssim 3.0~\rm{M}_{\odot}$) models successfully reproduce the observations. In addition, we estimated mean neutron exposures of the order of 0.6 -- 0.7 mb$^{-1}$ for the $s$-processed material observed in their envelopes. Applying an empirical initial-final mass relation, we constraint in $\sim 0.7\,\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ the mass of their dim white-dwarf companions. Moreover, our kinematic study revealed that the program stars are members of the thin disk, with probabilities greater than 70\%. Hence, we identified HD~15096 and HD~37792 as new barium dwarfs and confirmed that HD~141804 is a barium dwarf. Thus, the number of barium dwarfs identified in the literature from high-resolution spectroscopy increases to 71 objects.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 17:10:07 UTC (397 KB)[v2] Fri, 23 Feb 2024 19:15:20 UTC (388 KB)"
"3","Big data analytics to classify earthwork-related locations: A Chengdu study","Lei Yu, Ke Han","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Air pollution has significantly intensified, leading to severe health consequences worldwide. Earthwork-related locations (ERLs) constitute significant sources of urban dust pollution. The effective management of ERLs has long posed challenges for governmental and environmental agencies, primarily due to their classification under different regulatory authorities, information barriers, delays in data updating, and a lack of dust suppression measures for various sources of dust pollution. To address these challenges, we classified urban dust pollution sources using dump truck trajectory, urban point of interest (POI), and land cover data. We compared several prediction models and investigated the relationship between features and dust pollution sources using real data. The results demonstrate that high-accuracy classification can be achieved with a limited number of features. This method was successfully implemented in the system called Alpha MAPS in Chengdu to provide decision support for urban pollution control.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 16:50:32 UTC (4,520 KB)"
"4","Offshoring Emissions through Used Vehicle Exports","S.J. Newman, K. Schulte, M.M. Morellini, C. Rahal, D. Leasure","General Economics (econ.GN)","Policies to reduce transport emissions often overlook the international flow of used vehicles. We quantify the rate at which used vehicles generated CO2 and pollution for all used vehicles exported from Great Britain; a globally leading used vehicle exporter across 2005-2021. Destined for low-middle-income countries, exported vehicles fail roadworthiness standards and, even under extremely optimistic functioning as new assumptions, generate at least 13-53 percent more emissions than scrapped or on-road vehicles.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 13:44:59 UTC (1,033 KB)"
"5","Scalable Methods for Brick Kiln Detection and Compliance Monitoring from Satellite Imagery: A Deployment Case Study in India","Rishabh Mondal, Zeel B Patel, Vannsh Jani, Nipun Batra","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Air pollution kills 7 million people annually. Brick manufacturing industry is the second largest consumer of coal contributing to 8%-14% of air pollution in Indo-Gangetic plain (highly populated tract of land in the Indian subcontinent). As brick kilns are an unorganized sector and present in large numbers, detecting policy violations such as distance from habitat is non-trivial. Air quality and other domain experts rely on manual human annotation to maintain brick kiln inventory. Previous work used computer vision based machine learning methods to detect brick kilns from satellite imagery but they are limited to certain geographies and labeling the data is laborious. In this paper, we propose a framework to deploy a scalable brick kiln detection system for large countries such as India and identify 7477 new brick kilns from 28 districts in 5 states in the Indo-Gangetic plain. We then showcase efficient ways to check policy violations such as high spatial density of kilns and abnormal increase over time in a region. We show that 90% of brick kilns in Delhi-NCR violate a density-based policy. Our framework can be directly adopted by the governments across the world to automate the policy regulations around brick kilns.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 13:26:00 UTC (26,263 KB)"
"6","Photon Classification with Gradient Boosted Trees at CLAS12","Gregory Matousek, Anselm Vossen","High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)","Dihadron semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) of 10.6 GeV longitudinally polarized electrons off the proton has been measured using the CLAS12 detector at Jefferson Lab. Two separate channels, $\pi^+\pi^0$ and $\pi^-\pi^0$, were analyzed, requiring the reconstruction of diphoton pairs. In this analysis, we addressed the problem of false neutral particles being reconstructed by CLAS12's event builder, polluting the otherwise physical combinatorial background underneath the $\pi^0$ peak. A photon classifier using a Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTs) architecture was trained with Monte Carlo simulations to reduce the amount of background $\pi^0$'s. We show that the nearest-neighbor features learned by the model lead to a substantial increase in signal vs. background discrimination compared to previous CLAS12 $\pi^0$ analyses. The machine learning approach recovers several times more dihadron statistics for the dataset.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 16:00:41 UTC (1,534 KB)"
"7","Experimental study of aerosol deposition in distal lung bronchioles","Arnab Kumar Mallik","Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)","The deposition of micron particles finds importance in meteorology and several engineering applications such as deposition of dust in gas lines, carbon deposition in engine exhaust, designing effective air-cleaning systems and estimating deposition of inhaled drug or atmospheric pollutants to determine its consequences on human health. Although the existing literature on deposition in straight tubes is quite mature, an experimental study on deposition in micro capillaries with a wide ranges of Re that models particle dynamics in lungs, is missing. The deposition of atmospheric pollutants and nebulized drugs in the lung depends on various biological factors such as flow properties, lung morphology, breathing patterns, particle properties, deposition mechanism, etc. To complicate matters, each breath manifests flows spanning a wide range of Reynolds numbers in various regions of the lung. In this study, the deposition of nebulized aerosol was experimentally investigated in phantom bronchioles of diameters relevant to the 7th to the 23rd branching generations and over the entire range of Re manifest during one breathing cycle. The aerosol fluid was loaded with boron doped carbon quantum dots as a fluorophore. An aerosol was generated of this mixture fluid using an ultrasonic nebulizer, producing droplets of 6.5$\mu$m as the mean diameter. The amount of aerosol deposited on the bronchiole walls was measured using a spectrofluorometer. Finally, a universal bronchiole scale deposition model is proposed which can form the building block for lung-scale aerosol deposition prediction.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 16:59:26 UTC (7,363 KB)"
"8","PureNav: A Personalized Navigation Service for Environmental Justice Communities Impacted by Planned Disruptions","Omar Hammad, Md Rezwanur Rahman, Nicholas Clements, Shivakant Mishra, Shelly Miller, Esther Sullivan","Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)","Planned disruptions such as highway constructions are commonplace nowadays and the communities living near these disruptions generally tend to be environmental justice communities -- low socioeconomic status with disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects. A major concern is that such activities negatively impact people's well-being by disrupting their daily commutes via frequent road closures and increased dust and air pollution. This paper addresses this concern by developing a personalized navigation service called PureNav to mitigate the negative impacts of disruptions in daily commutes on people's well-being. PureNav has been designed using active engagement with four environmental justice communities affected by major highway construction. It has been deployed in the real world among the members of the four communities, and a detailed analysis of the data collected from this deployment as well as surveys show that PureNav is potentially useful in improving people's well-being. The paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of PureNav, and offers suggestions for further improving its efficacy.","Sat, 17 Feb 2024 03:29:20 UTC (6,086 KB)"
"9","Investigating black hole accretion disks as potential polluter sources for the formation of enriched stars in globular clusters","Laurane Fréour, Alice Zocchi, Glenn van de Ven, Elena Pancino","Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)","Accretion disks surrounding stellar mass black holes (BHs) have been suggested as potential locations for the nucleosynthesis of light elements, which are our primary observational discriminant of multiple stellar populations within globular clusters. The population of enriched stars in globular clusters are enhanced in N14, Na23, and sometimes in Al27 and/or in K39. In this study, our aim is to investigate the feasibility of initiating nucleosynthesis for these four elements in BH accretion disks, considering various internal parameters such as the temperature of the gas and timescale of the accretion. To achieve this, we employed a 132-species reaction network. We used the slim disk model, suitable for the Super-Eddington mass accretion rate and for geometrically and optically thick disks. We explored the conditions related to the mass, mass accretion rate, viscosity, and radius of the BH-accretion disk system that would allow for the creation of N14, Na23, Al27, and K39 before the gas is accreted onto the central object. Our findings reveal that there is no region in the parameter space where the formation of Na23 can occur and only a very limited region where the formation of N14, Al27, and K39 is plausible. Specifically, this occurs for BHs with masses lower than 10 solar masses, with a preference toward even lower mass values and extremely low viscosity parameters ($\alpha <10^{-3}$). Such values are highly unlikely based on current observations of stellar mass BHs. However, such low mass BHs could actually exist in the early universe, as so-called primordial BHs. In conclusion, our study suggests that the nucleosynthesis within BH accretion disks of four elements of interest for the multiple stellar populations is improbable, but not impossible, using the slim disk model.","Fri, 16 Feb 2024 11:23:40 UTC (1,427 KB)"
"10","The affect of Some Meteorological Parameters on Particulate Matters Concentration Over Iraq using Remote Sensing dataset","Sabah Hussein Ali, Amina Basil Mohammed","Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)","Numerous countries have built urban stations for monitoring the amount of PM2.5 in the atmosphere. In Iraq, there aren't enough stations to monitor PM2.5 pollution levels across all governorates. As a result, satellite remote sensing data is used in the majority of studies aimed at monitoring PM2.5 and the impact of other factors on it. The current study aimed to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of (PM2.5) and its relationship with the meteorological parameters.(Air temperature, Relative humidity, Precipitation and wind speed) in Iraq during two periods (2001 and 2022). The dataset adopted in the study were downloaded from the Giovanni user interface which is based on satellite remote sensing data and reanalysis by MERRA-2model which produce by NASA. The output results shows that, the seasonal and annual PM2.5 concentration values increased from 2001 to 2022 due especially in the center and south of Iraq with the highest values of PM2.5 concentration recorded in the summers of 2001 and 2022 being 172.41 micro.g/m3 and 190.06 micro.g/m3 (increased 10.24%), respectively. Because of the low average temperature and the influence of northeasterly winds bringing continental air from Central Asia, PM2.5 values in northern and northeastern Iraq are lower than those in the center and southern regions. in 2001, they ranged from 8.41 to 12.6 micro.g/m3, whereas in 2022, they ranged from 9.02 to 15.98 micro.g/m3 throughout the year. Rainfall during the cold months in the north and northeast is an essential factor in cleaning the air of PM2.5. Also, study results indicate that the max. of PM 2.5 values have consistently exceeded the upper limits of PM2.5 quarterly standards set by both the US and Iraqi regulations, for the years 2001 and 2022, but the min. PM2.5 values are within both standards.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 19:26:46 UTC (1,531 KB)"
